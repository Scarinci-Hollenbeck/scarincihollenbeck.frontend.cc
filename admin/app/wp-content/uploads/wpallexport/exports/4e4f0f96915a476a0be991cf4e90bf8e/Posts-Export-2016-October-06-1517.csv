1938,"Protecting Your Attorney-Client Privilege Today","The attorney-client privilege is, in its broad outlines, familiar to most people. The privilege belongs to the client and covers confidential communications by the client to his or her attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The privilege also covers the legal advice given by the attorney to the client in response to the client's request. The effect of the privilege is to protect these confidential communications from, for example, forced disclosure in a lawsuit. However, because the privilege depends upon the communications remaining confidential, it may be lost or ""waived"" if the communications are made in the presence of a third party or otherwise disclosed to a third party.

&nbsp;

In the not too distant past, preservation of the confidentiality of these privileged attorney-client communications was relatively routine and easy to protect. Many of these communications were documentary in form, legended as ""confidential"" and ""privileged"", and placed in files marked ""confidential"" or ""attorney-client communications"". The making and dissemination of copies of these confidential and privileged documents were within the control of the custodian of the files. This control reduced significantly the risk that the document or copies of the document, through inadvertence or otherwise, might be distributed to third parties or, in the case of large organizations, to employees who had no need to be involved in the privileged communications because the subject matter of the communications fell outside the scope of their employment duties and responsibilities. The risk of ""waiving"" or losing the privilege that attached to these communications was, therefore, manageable.

Advances in information technology have greatly complicated the protection of privileged attorney-client communications. Email communications have, to a large extent, replaced documentary communications. Discrete attorney-client communications, particularly in large organizations, not infrequently become part of lengthy email strands or ""strings"", which consist largely of non-privileged, business communications. These email ""strings"" may now be forwarded to numerous recipients with one click of a computer mouse. These features of modern-day communications greatly increase the risk of attorney-client communications being sent to third parties or to employees who are outside the scope of the privilege and, therefore, greatly increase the risk of ""waiving"" or losing the privilege that would otherwise attach to the attorney-client communications buried within the email ""string"".

It has become routine for attorneys to place on all emails a footer or tag which characterizes the communication as privileged and requests unintended recipients to destroy and/or return electronic documents without reading them. These footers are usually in small print. They do little or nothing to alert a client that by forwarding the email or by including it in a string of emails any privilege attached to the communication may be waived and lost.

These risks may be significantly reduced in several ways. First, an attorney should take the time to discuss with clients the risks involved in communicating privileged information via email. Second, the attorney should clearly and at the beginning of an electronic communication to a client identify the communication as privileged. This can be accomplished by creating a conspicuous legend similar to the following: ""PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT MATERIAL--DO NOT FORWARD."" Third, the client can adopt and implement a requirement that all attorney-client email communications must bear a legend identifying them as such and that careful consideration must be given before forwarding these communications. Fourth, given the fallibility of human nature, computer programs and applications can be installed which will prevent privileged material so legended from being forwarded by the recipient. Although the protection afforded by these programs and applications is not absolute, circumvention requires effort and, for this reason, these devices should serve to prevent inadvertent or unintended dissemination of privileged materials.

Although these measures may seem burdensome, new Court Rules and discovery techniques relating to electronic storage of information make it increasingly likely that emails and other electronically stored documents that relate to litigation strategy and legal advice will become available to adversaries. And in non-litigation matters, legal advice not intended to be transmitted to employees and competitors may, through inadvertence or otherwise, be so transmitted and lose the protection of the attorney-client privilege.

We recommend public entities consider adopting guidelines for the use of e-mails, texting or other electronic communication to avoid possible violations of the Open Public Meetings Act. Please contact our office for help drafting this policy

1941,"IS THE FIVE-MILLION DOLLAR GIFT TAX EXEMPTION ABOUT TO END?","<strong>By <a title=""Frank L. Brunetti"" href=""/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/"">Frank L. Brunetti</a> </strong>| The Tax Relief Act of 2010 made significant changes to the gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax regimes by increasing the amount each individual can give without incurring tax from $1 million to $5 million. The increase was not permanent however, and rumor has it that it may be in jeopardy. To avoid any risk, those who have decided to use their full exemptions should do so no later than December 31, 2011, and, if feasible, November 22.

Generally, loans between related parties are governed by the IRS code so that related parties cannot assign income without adverse tax consequences. There is a small exclusion between related parties so that a loan of $10,000 generally does not require that interest be charged.

<strong>The Rumors</strong>

Rumors circulating recently within the financial and estate-planning communities have suggested the $5 million exemptions may be in immediate jeopardy. Democratic staff on the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means recently proposed decreasing the $5 million gift, generation-skipping transfer tax and estate tax exemptions to $3.5 million, effective January 1, 2012. There also are rumors the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Super Committee) may recommend a drop down in the gift tax exemption to $1 million, effective at year end, or possibly as early as November 23, 2011, when its recommendations are scheduled to be released, though there is no confirmation this rumor is true.

As we all know ""everything"" is on the table before the super-committee (although they would not admit it), I would caution you to advise your clients of these developments and act sooner rather than later.

<span class=""subnews"">Circular 230 requires that we notify you that, in the absence of written advice that strictly complies with such rules, you cannot rely on advice given to you relating to any Internal Revenue Code matter for protection against a tax penalty. This notice is neither intended to be used for the purpose of avoiding any tax penalty nor can it be relied on in support of any marketed transaction. It is our intention to continue to deliver the highest quality services to you and in a cost efficient manner.

1972,"Piercing the Corporate Veil","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Piercing the Corporate Veil</h2>
One of the biggest advantages to incorporating a business is liability protection. Forming a corporation, limited liability or similar entity forms what is called a corporate veil, a division between an entity and the personal assets of the shareholders of a corporation. If challenged in a lawsuit, IRS audit or other action, the veil of liability protection may be pierced and the shareholders may be held liable for the debts and/or liabilities of the corporation if it is found that the corporation did not follow proper corporate formalities.
<h3><strong>Shareholder Protection</strong></h3>
<a href=""/practices/limited-liability-companies/"">A corporation and an LLC is a legal person or entity that exists separately from its shareholders</a>. It may, therefore, contract or otherwise incur obligations apart from a shareholder. As a result, one desired aspect of a corporation is that shareholders (or in the case of an LLC, the members) are not individually liable for the debts or obligations of the entity. For purposes of our discussion, references herein to corporations will apply similarly to LLCs.

In some circumstances, however, courts will ignore the corporate identity and hold the individual shareholders liable for the debts and obligations of that corporation by applying a legal theory that is commonly referred to as the alter ego doctrine. Under this theory, if a party whose interest has been injured due to the acts of a corporation can prove that the corporation entity is the alter ego of one or more individuals, the court may hold the individuals themselves personally responsible for the injurious conduct.

Typically, an alter ego allegation is made against a corporation and its shareholders when the corporations assets or insurance are inadequate to respond to a claim or to pay a debt. A creditor who would otherwise go unpaid by the corporation will seek to hold its shareholders personally liable for the claim based on the theory that:
<ul class=""bullets"">
	<li>The shareholder has not treated the corporation as an entity separate and apart from themselves so why should the Court,</li>
	<li>When maintaining the corporate veil would be inequitable. Piercing the corporate veil has been granted in 40% of the cases where the issue was raised.</li>
</ul>
Piercing initiated by the federal government is effective in almost 60% of the cases it has raised and more than 80% of the time when raised in a regulatory context or in environmental litigation and in fraud cases [R. Thompson, Piercing the Corporate Veil: An Empirical Study, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1036, 1948-49 (1991)].

The equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil is applied in New Jersey in situations where the principal, i.e. owner, uses the corporation (or his LLC) as his alter ego and thus abuses the corporate form in order to advance his own personal interests. See<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Walensky v. Jonathan Royce International, Inc.</span>, 264 N.J. Super. 276 (App. Div. 1993). The two primary factors that weigh in favor of an alter ego finding are the use of the business as a personal business conduit and a lack of a separate corporate identity. Judge Stripp distinctly summarized the criteria for piercing the corporate veil under New Jersey common laws as follows:
<div>
<ol>
	<li>A shareholder disregarded the corporate entity and made it into a mere instrumentality for their own affairs.</li>
	<li>There was such a unity of interest and ownership that the owners and the corporation have no separate existence; and</li>
	<li>Upholding the corporate veil would protect fraud or promote other injustice.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3><strong>Piercing the Corporate Veil in Bankruptcy</strong></h3>
In Bankruptcy proceedings, the court uses a concept called substantive consolidation to in effect pierce the veil. This doctrine permits the bankruptcy court to pool all of the debtors assets as well as the assets of affiliated entities owned by the debtor, in order to satisfy claims against the debtor. Substantive consolidation will be allowed when:
<ul class=""bullets"">
	<li>The creditor dealt with the entities as a whole, and not as separate entities, and</li>
	<li>The affairs of the debtor are so intertwined that the consolidation would benefit all of the creditors.</li>
</ul>
A fruitful discussion of piercing the corporate veil in a bankruptcy case in New Jersey can be found in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Buildings by Jamie, Inc.</span>, United States Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey, Case No. 96-39381. In<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Buildings by Jamie, Inc.</span>, the creditors of the bankrupt debtor sought to recover monies loaned to the debtor. The debtor was a close corporation which constructed homes for sale to third parties. During a certain period of time preceding the bankruptcy, loans were made to the debtor for use exclusively in the construction of these homes. The debtor did not repay the loans. The creditors allege that the debtor transferred the net proceeds of sale of several homes to Jamie, Inc. (not the debtor) for no consideration, which in turn transferred $100,000 to the individual owners again for no consideration. The creditors further allege that the debtors transferred accounts receivables to a related corporation for no consideration.

The creditors further argued that the individual debtors used the loan money from a guaranty for their personal benefit including construction of their personal residence and the purchase of real property and renovation of business property which was not owned by the debtor. Finally, the creditors alleged that in a series of transactions the debtor transferred all of its cash and several thousand dollars worth of assets to a related corporation for no consideration. During the period in question, the debtor ceased operations but the related corporations continued operations virtually indistinguishable from the debtors business. These corporations were operated from the same location, by the same employees, shared the same offices and had the same shareholder.

The plaintiff sought to compel the debtor to repay the loan obligations and the transfers among debtor and non-debtor defendants. In doing so, they allege that the individual shareholders were liable for the debtors debts based upon an alter ego theory. The plaintiffs relied on lack of corporate formalities among the debtor and the non-debtor defendants as well as the free transferability of assets and share ownership, use of the same employees, same location and same line of business.

The plaintiffs sought to pierce the corporate veil based upon the complete disregard of corporate formalities, free transfer of assets among the corporations and the shareholders and the interchangeable use of corporations.

In reviewing New Jersey alter ego law, Judge Stripps sitting in the Bankruptcy Court reaffirmed the principal that it is well settled in New Jersey that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is employed when fraud or injustice has been perpetrated. The court stated that the principal (owner) could be held liable under theories of piercing the corporate veil and successor liability because the principal was using the corporation as his alter ego and thus was abusing the corporate form in order to advance his own personal interest.

Factors which weighed heavily included the principals treatment of the corporation as a personal business conduit and that the corporation was a mere instrument through which the shareholder conducted their own affairs and furthermore the principal failed to maintain an identity separate and apart from the corporation. The court also noted that in New Jersey courts generally pierce the corporate veil where such unity of ownership exists where the corporation operates as an instrument of the shareholders personal business such that the failure to disregard the corporate entity would promote fraud. Finally, the court concluded that the bankruptcy trustee had the power to reach beyond the debtor corporation into the pockets of the corporations shareholders.
<h3>How to Avoid Having the Corporate Veil Pierced</h3>
Shareholders are not liable for corporate debts or lawsuit liability if the corporation is properly established and maintained. To help insure that creditors cannot pierce the corporate veil and seek judgments against the shareholders, corporate formalities must be observed, the corporation must be treated as an entity separate and apart from its shareholders. Make sure the corporation has done the following:
<ul class=""bullets"">
	<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Documentation and Formalities</span>: Create By-Laws, issue stock, maintain an up to date corporate minute book (do not wait for the night before an audit to create them), have separate books of account, file annual reports, have regular board meetings with all directors.</li>
	<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Avoid Co-mingling</span>: Do not co-mingle corporate assets with those of shareholders, all corporate assets should be titled in the corporate name. Corporations should have its own separate bank account. If you borrow from, or lend to the corporation, record an appropriate Resolution, sign a promissory note, charge fair market rate interest, make regular payments.</li>
	<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Capitalization</span>: Appropriately capitalize the corporation and purchase appropriate liability insurance.</li>
	<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Employment Agreements</span>: Enter into one between you and your corporation.</li>
	<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Multiple Corporation</span>: Avoid identical stock ownership of several corporations. Avoid having similar officers and directors. Use different business addresses, telephone numbers and employees.</li>
</ul>
In addition, the fact that a business is being operation as the corporation should be made evident. The words inc. or incorporated should be present on letterheads, business cards and corporate signs. Those who operate the entity should sign all contracts and documents in a corporate capacity indicating their corporate position.

In these uncertain times, the valuable advice you give your clients can pay dividends. An important part of estate planning and wealth preservation is the protection of assets. Keeping corporate liabilities separate from shareholders is an important part of the asset protection plan.

3013,"New Jersey Supreme Court Decides 911 Operators Entitled to Immunity","In deciding an appeal filed by the Scarinci Hollenbeck Litigation Group on behalf of two 911 operators,  the New Jersey Supreme Court released its decision in <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20NJCO%2020120308280.xml&amp;docbase=CsLwAr3-2007-Curr"" target=""_blank"">Paris Wilson v. City of Jersey City</a> yesterday morning (Thursday, March 8, 2012). The issue in this appeal was whether the 911 immunity statute, N.J.S.A 52:17C-10 provides immunity to 911 operators and their public-entity employers from civil liability for the negligent mishandling of emergency calls. The case, concerned the handling of an emergency call reporting a disturbance that, in fact, turned out to be a horrific multiple homicide involving a mother and her children. In the first New Jersey Supreme Court interpretation of this statute the court overruled two previously decided Appellate Decision cases and disapproved of a federal court case, when the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that 911 operators in public entities had immunity from negligence in connection with the delivery of 911 services, including the mishandling of 911 calls. Arguing the case on behalf of the two Jersey City 911 call takers was <a href=""/attorneys/partners/robert-e-levy/"">Robert E. Levy</a>, Chair of the Scarinci Hollenbeck Litigation Group. Also working on the case were <a href=""/attorneys/counsel/michael-a-cifelli/"">Michael Cifelli</a>, CJ Griffin and <a href=""/attorneys/associates/christina-m-michelson/"">Christina Michelson</a>.

This is a significant victory because it provides protection to 911 call takers who are placed in stressful situations while handling emergency telephone calls. It insures that financially strapped municipalities and counties will avoid the expense of future lawsuits or the potential that insurance companies would not provide coverage for 911 operators. The decision is also likely to be followed throughout the United States, as many states have similar 911 immunity statutes.",,20120309,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/just-in/new-jersey-supreme-court-decides-911-operators-entitled-to-immunity/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Just In|Firm News>Litigation Alert","911 operators|christina michelson|city of jersey city|cj griffin|michael cifelli|new jersey supreme court|paris wilson|robert levy|scarinci and hollenbeck|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,10,new-jersey-supreme-court-decides-911-operators-entitled-to-immunity,,,0,0,open,open

The New Jersey Supreme Court filed its decision in <em>Paris Wilson v. City of Jersey City</em> yesterday morning (Thursday, March 8, 2012).  <a href=""/attorneys/partners/robert-e-levy/"" target=""_blank"">Robert E. Levy</a> was particularly enthusiastic about the result.  “This was a very hard fought case,” said Levy.  “We won in the trial court but lost in the Appellate Division.  Other appellate cases on the same subject matter did not support our position.  The Supreme Court sifted through a very complex statute and came to a conclusion that benefited 911 operators and governmental entities throughout the state.”

Since this decision is likely to be followed throughout the United States, Mr. Levy also commented on the effects that this may have nationwide.  “There are many states that have similar statutes.  The reasoning of the NJ Supreme Court should provide welcomed guidance in resolving disputes nationwide.”

<a href=""/attorneys/counsel/michael-a-cifelli/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Cifelli </a>shared similar views on the victory.  “Although this was a difficult and complex case,” said Cifelli, “the Supreme Court’s decision reflects the simple observation that emergency service providers and first responders within each municipality of our state, from boroughs to townships to cities, face difficult challenges on a daily basis. From here, emergency service providers can face those challenges in good faith and without concern of litigation.”

3591,"Social Media Legal Issues in the Workplace","<strong>By <a title=""Sean D. Dias"" href=""/attorneys/counsel/sean-d-dias/"">Sean D. Dias, Esq.</a></strong> | The explosion of social media is impacting almost all aspects of modern life. The workplace is no exception. However, the advent of social media creates new legal issues -- especially in the workplace. Internet outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube allow employees to network, advertise, and collaborate in a fashion not done before. Yet, these advancements in communication are not without price.

Managers and employees now face uncertainty over what is considered private and exclusive, rather than part of the workplace, and what online behavior can be grounds for workplace discipline, or even legal action. Recently companies like Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Burger King and Lloyds Banking Corporation all faced legal situations involving employees and social media.

The rise in such issues is why businesses are both taking a much greater interest in their employees' online activities and trying to develop rules to protect themselves. The overall question presented by social media is, ""how can the law reasonably protect both the employee and the employer without infringing upon either parties' rights?""

These issues also intertwine with the First Amendment rights of free Speech and free press. In this new world, how far do First Amendment rights now extend? What is considered a violation of an employee's rights? When is a company legally allowed to take punitive action against an employee? What obligations do employer's have to monitor their employees? These are all questions complicated by the introduction of social media.

Companies are finding it necessary to develop policies that are within the scope of this emerging law, but that still allow them to monitor and maintain their online reputations. This requires addressing issues such as the breach of confidentiality agreements, the duty of loyalty commitments, defamation, copy right violations, and the exposure of trade secrets and other kinds of disclosures through the use of social media. Companies often have policies in place regarding emails or file sharing, but now these policies need to account for information shared through social media. Before the introduction of social media, most of what an employee did outside the workplace did not carry over into the professional sphere. Now the personal and professional worlds seem to be blending together in an intoxicating cocktail that is social media.

Scarinci is joined by co-author Mark Magyar, a Rutgers University professor and former policy advisor to Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Magyar authored numerous articles on redistricting and politics prior to teaming up with Scarinci to co-author, Redistricting and the Politics of Reform.

In their book, Scarinci and Magyar discuss the redistricting process in the 20 states that use commissions, rather state legislatures, to draw new district lines. The book analyses and compares the various forms these commissions take and explores their history and practice over the decades. The authors include extensive anecdotes and use newspaper accounts and comments from some of the major players in each state to show how these commissions actually work. Readers can make their own assessment about whether a redistricting commission is more or less non-partisan than redistricting by the full state legislature in those states who redistrict in the historically traditional way.

Scarinci has been a guest commentator for News 12 New Jersey and has accepted various other speaking engagements in January and February. In addition, Scarinci and Magyar have plans to work as guest columnists for several publications as the redistricting process unfolds in 2011.",,20111107,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/donald-scarinci-co-authors-in-depth-redistricting-book/,,,,,,,"Firm News",,publish,10,donald-scarinci-co-authors-in-depth-redistricting-book,,,0,0,open,open

3626,"Is the ""Pilot Light"" Going Out in New Jersey?","<strong>By <a title=""Patrick J. McNamara"" href=""/attorneys/partners/patrick-j-mcnamara/"">Patrick J. Mcnamara</a></strong> | On August 18, 2010 the State Controller, Matthew Boxer, issued a report called ""A Programmatic Examination of Municipal Tax Abatements"". In a cover letter sending the report to the Governor and the Legislature, Mr. Boxer wrote that ""tax abatements result in significant foregone revenue and introduce tax inequities that deserve closer scrutiny. The recommendations in this report are geared toward broad-based changes that will help to ensure a more open and fair investment of taxpayer dollars and better decisions and outcomes in the future."" In the report, the Controller's office made a series of findings in its review, which it described as ""numerous weaknesses in the regulation, implementation of oversight"" of tax abatements. Among those weaknesses were the following items:
<ul class=""descr"">
	<li>That PILOT payments distort municipal incentives at the expense of county school districts and other taxpayers;</li>
	<li>That information concerning these agreements is not published in a transparent manner or centralized location, thus making it ""impossible for the public to compare, and calculate the effect of, or be fully aware of those agreements"";</li>
	<li>Many of the criteria and processes used by municipalities in evaluating potential abatement agreements are considered ""weak"";</li>
	<li>Directly affected stakeholders are not involved in the abatement decision making process in an adequate fashion;</li>
	<li>Follow up at the municipal level on these agreements and benefits is lacking accountability and feedback;</li>
	<li>Redevelopment areas in which tax abatements may be granted are not periodically reviewed to account for neighborhood changes or improvement;</li>
	<li>Municipalities often fail to use abatements to bring in the type of redevelopment that would address community needs or bring appropriate improvements; and</li>
	<li>That that State does not monitor these agreements or offer significant guidance to municipalities on how to interpret relevant statutes or implement abatement programs.</li>
</ul>
The report then made a series of recommendations; among them are the following:
<ul class=""descr"">
	<li>School districts, counties and the public need a greater role in the process.</li>
	<li>PILOT agreements should be structured in a way to encompass the interests of counties and school districts.</li>
	<li>A thorough cost benefit analysis of community impact should be undertaken before awarding any abatement.</li>
	<li>Strong criterion processes should be set up front by local ordinances to ensure that applications for tax abatements adhere to appropriate standards to receive approval.</li>
	<li>Periodic reviews and reclassifications of areas that are designated as ""in need of redevelopment"" should be instituted.</li>
	<li>Applications for abatements should be due before project construction begins.</li>
	<li>Local tax listings should clearly identify redevelopment or rehabilitation abatements to remove transparency and permit proper review.</li>
	<li>Periodic municipal review and follow up concerning developer performance should be required after an abatement is entered into by a municipality.</li>
	<li>The State needs to maintain and make available to the public records concerning tax abatement policies and practices throughout the State.</li>
	<li>The State should provide enhanced and increased guidance to municipalities on granting and implementing such agreements.</li>
	<li>The State, through the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs, should actively review municipal abatement practices and choices, particularly with regard to high value agreements.</li>
</ul>
The report did note that in 2009 the Department of Community Affairs adopted a rule to require municipalities to provide additional information concerning any long term tax abatement project, including the value of the project, the statutory basis for the abatement, and the basis for calculation of the amount of the PILOT payment. However, the report noted the rule has not yet been implemented and so DCA has not yet instructed municipalities to provide this information. The last time such information was collected through the Division of Local Government Services within DCA was in 2003.

The report also focused on 75 municipalities where such agreements have been entered into or other exemptions made that exceeded 5% of the total taxable value of land in the municipality. Of the 75 municipalities, 40 had little redevelopment or rehabilitation activity, with exemptions instead aimed at public properties, medical facilities or nature preserves. The records indicated only 23 municipalities had granted many of the high value abatements for rehabilitation and redevelopment. Those municipalities that were found to have made significant use of such abatements were the following: Asbury Park, Atlantic City, Bayonne, Bridgeton, Camden, Collingswood, Harrison, Hoboken, Gloucester Township, Jersey City, Long Branch, Millville, Newark, New Brunswick, Paterson, Rahway, South Bound Brook, Vineland, Union City, Trenton, East Rutherford, Elizabeth and West New York. The report also noted that 16 of the 23 municipalities received additional state funding as Abbott Districts. All 23 also received special municipal aid in 2009 and 2010. The report also noted that 18 of the 23 municipalities covered less than half of their municipal costs through local property taxes, and 15 had more than 40% of their local costs covered by state aid in 2009.

In sum, this report is calling for a major overhaul of how tax abatements and PILOT agreements are used throughout New Jersey. First, the report recommends that the current abatement structure must be adjusted to deal with the loss of tax revenue by schools and counties. The report even goes so far as to consider that PILOTs be eliminated in favor of partial tax reductions. It recommends county government have a greater role in coordinating redevelopment and abatement practices across municipalities, especially with review of large development projects that may receive abatements that would impact tax burdens on county residents. The report recommends very strongly that comprehensive and detailed cost benefit analysis must be performed for potential long-term abatement projects. It recommends that such analysis include consideration of any losses in ratable property that would be suffered by the municipality, the county, and the local school district, and its resulting revenue implications. It recommends strengthening and tightening criteria to make sure that abatement applications adhere to appropriate standards before approval.

Given that municipalities across the State are struggling to find new sources of revenue, and there being a dearth of significant redevelopment projects moving forward across the State, some may view the contents of this report as yet another ""wet blanket"" being placed on the efforts to revive the real estate development industry as a whole in New Jersey. However, many redevelopment projects have enjoyed great success because of their transparency and involvement of the public by the local municipality in the redevelopment process. Just as the courts reigned in municipalities who overstretched the bounds of the Redevelopment Law in designating properties that should not have been deemed as areas in need of redevelopment, this report, in much the same way, seeks to reign in the tax abatement process in a manner to ensure greater transparency and fairness, as well as requiring that a thorough fiscal impact be done before a municipality enters into such an agreement. It remains to be seen, given the challenges currently facing the Legislature with the package of proposed legislation as part of the Governor's ""tool kit"" to control property taxes, whether legislation will be introduced to convert these recommendations into law.",,20100907,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/is-the-pilot-light-going-out-in-new-jersey/,,,,,,,"Firm News",,publish,10,is-the-pilot-light-going-out-in-new-jersey,,,0,0,open,open

William H. Gindin Bankruptcy Bench-Bar Conference. The Conference will be held on Friday, May 13, 2011 at the Brunswick Hilton in East Brunswick, New Jersey.

The focus of the panel session will be on the long-established practice under which New Jersey municipalities have sold their overdue real estate tax claims to third party investors. Such tax certificate sales benefit the municipalities by providing them with payment of their taxes without requiring that they acquire title to the lands. Tax certificate buyers have been induced into making these investments by the 18% interest rate that such tax obligations accrue under New Jersey law.

However, last year in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">In re Princeton Office Park, L.P.</span>, 423 B.R. 795 (Bkrtcy. D.N.J. 2010), the court threw this well-functioning system into chaos (and created new law in New Jersey in the process). The ruling essentially held that a bankruptcy judge could unilaterally reduce the 18% interest rate in order to confirm a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan of reorganization.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Princeton Office Park</span> is now on appeal to the Third Circuit, and a ruling is expected within the next year.

Schwartz</a>, with their sixty five years of combined experience in the solid waste industry, described the project as a major breakthrough in the management of landfill closure capping practices.

The project, once deployed and installed, will provide solar energy at landfill sites requiring final cover material by the use of a specially designed dual purpose flexible geomembrane with solar photovoltaic laminates to capture solar energy for use on and/or offsite. This system will provide landfill owners and regulators with exciting alternatives to save on the costs of expensive closure requirements and provide revenues from solar energy. This is the first demonstration project utilizing Carlisle's proprietary flexible geomembrane system in the Northeast and it will be a marquee facility in the Meadowlands. The system is successfully in use in other parts of the United States.

3686,"Growing Economic Development in New Jersey Meadowlands ","As economic development slows in many regions across the country, the New Jersey Meadowlands has seen the opposite. The approval of numerous projects within the Meadowlands District by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission (NJMC) has made that area a destination for economic growth. The close proximity of the Meadowlands District to New York City and major New Jersey transportation hubs makes it an ideal place to conduct business and emerging companies are recognizing and seizing that potential.

Scarinci Hollenbeck, a law firm with its main offices in Lyndhurst, a municipality within the Meadowlands District, has supported this economic development with its work on several projects.

Brooklyn-based Atlantic Hoisting and Scaffolding, LLC, one of the largest scaffolding contractors in the northeast and chosen scaffolding supplier for the rebuilding of the Freedom Towers was looking to relocate its approximately 200 employees to the Meadowlands for its proximity to Manhattan and located a suitable 9 acre site in Carlstadt. The property presented several challenges from the transactional, environmental, condemnation and use approval aspects. Significantly, the zoning of the site would not permit outdoor storage and the proposed use required a substantial amount of outdoor storage. <a title=""Mark K.

Upon Follender's presentation of his legal and historical analysis of the site, and in consideration of the importance of the project to the community, the NJMC agreed to relax the usual six month time period and the use variance was granted within 5 weeks of filing of the application.

3794,"Scarinci Hollenbeck Client Inks Deal to Sell Carbon Credits","Scarinci Hollenbeck client <a href=""http://www.scmua.org/"">Sussex County Municipal Utilities Authority</a> (SCMUA) has just signed an agreement with the Port Authority of NY and NJ to sell the Port Authority, 64,000 tons of ""carbon credits"" generated by SCMUA's voluntary capture and destruction of landfill gas at the Sussex County landfill in Lafayette, NJ. As noted by Bill Baroni, the PANYNJ deputy executive director, “[t]he Sussex Project will help New Jersey residents by improving their air quality.”

This announcement follows a 22-year agreement, executed on January 21, 2010, by which Energenic, a NJ-based renewable energy firm which is a joint venture of Marina Energy and DCO Energy, will construct and operate a new, $9 Million, state-of-the art Landfill Gas-to-Energy (LFGTE) Facility at the SCMUA landfill. Energenic broke ground on the 3-Megawatt LFGTE Facility on June 2, 2010, having been selected by SCMUA following a competitive proposal process. Energenic will share revenue from the renewable energy project with SCMUA. The Facility is funded, in part, through grants and tax credits made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Landfill gas contains methane, a greenhouse gas that is twenty-three times more potent in atmospheric global warming than carbon dioxide. Through the on-site vendor, Energenic, SCMUA burns the landfill gas to destroy the methane and create electricity, which is sold to a local electric utility. SCMUA's landfill gas is derived from decomposing municipal solid waste; burning the gas creates enough energy to power over 3,000 homes annually while the environmental benefit is equivalent to removing 28,000 cars from NJ highways.

Thomas Prol, <a title=""Sandra T. Ayres"" href=""/attorneys/counsel/sandra-t-ayres/"">Sandy Ayres</a>, Jacqueline Gioioso, Matt Giacobbe, SCMUA Chief Engineer Thomas Varro, P.E. and SCMUA Administrator John Hatzelis, were involved in this 2-year project which included detailed validation and verification processes prior to marketing on the Chicago Climate Exchange.

Lowy and Lauren James-Weir of Scarinci Hollenbeck’s <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law/"" title=""Sports and Entertainment Law"">Media Law Group</a> won a major victory in federal court recently when Judge Joel Pisano granted summary judgment in favor of their clients, Millennium Radio Group, LLC (owner of WKXW 101.5 FM), and “shock jocks” Craig Carton and Ray Rossi, Defendants in the action.

The lawsuit stemmed from a photograph that was taken by photographer Peter Murphy, who was hired by New Jersey Monthly to illustrate NJM’s annual “Best of Jersey” awards in which Carton and Rossi were named the State’s top shock jocks for 2006. The photograph featured Carton and Rossi, seemingly nude, behind a sign identifying 101.5 FM, WKXW, the radio station for which they both worked at the time. Shortly after the photograph appeared in NJM, Defendants copied it and posted it on their WKXW website to inform their listeners of their award. Listeners then began submitting parodies of the photograph and Defendants posted thumbnail versions of these images on the website. At some point thereafter, Murphy’s attorney wrote to the radio station accusing the station of violating Murphy’s copyright. According to Murphy, after the letter was sent to the station, Carton and Rossi made certain on-air comments about Murphy, characterizing him in a factual way as “a man not to be trusted” in a business environment; a man who “will sue you if you have business dealings with him” and, in substance, as a man with whom “a person should avoid doing business.” Plaintiff further alleged that Carton and Rossi discussed the manner in which Murphy had them pose for the photograph and “derogatorily inferred Plaintiff was a homosexual.”

Murphy ultimately filed suit against Defendants alleging various copyright violations, violations of the Digital Management Copyright Act (DCMA) and defamation claims. Prior to any depositions being taken, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In response, Plaintiff filed a motion asserting that further discovery was needed and that the summary judgment motion was premature. Defendants countered that no further discovery was needed as Defendants were accepting as true, solely for the purposes of the summary judgment motion, all facts as asserted in Plaintiff’s Complaint. The Court agreed with Defendants and allowed the summary judgment motion to go forward.  

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment included arguments that (1) the Digital Management Copyright Act did not apply to the facts of this case; (2) Defendants’ use of the work was classic “fair use;” (3) the on-air statements of Carton and Rossi were nothing more than rhetorical hyperbole; and (4) the assertion that someone is homosexual is not defamatory. The Court agreed with these arguments and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on all counts.",,20100728,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/media-law-group-achieves-significant-victory/,,,,,,,"Firm News",,publish,10,media-law-group-achieves-significant-victory,,,0,0,open,open

3835,"Ameripay Files Chapter 7 Bankruptcy","<strong>By Joel R. Glucksman </strong>| Many New Jersey public entities, already struggling with increasing costs and decreasing revenues, may be facing another fiscal challenge if they used the payroll company Ameripay.

<strong>The Ameripay Fraud</strong>
Various counties, municipalities, and other public entities turned over their payroll tax deposits to Ameripay, expecting it to remit these funds to the federal and state taxing authorities. Unfortunately, it is alleged that in many cases, Ameripay failed to do so, leaving its clients potentially liable to make good themselves on the missing funds.

In May, 2009, the United States District Court froze Ameripay’s assets and appointed a receiver. On June 25 the receiver obtained an order authorizing him to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which was done on July 9, 2009.

<strong>Affected Public Entities Must File a Proof of Claim</strong>
In Chapter 7, a bankruptcy trustee will be appointed to organize Ameripay’s assets and pay a dividend to its creditors. Any public entity wishing to receive a dividend must file a proof of their claim in the Bankruptcy Court. Failure to do so in a timely manner will deprive the entity of the right to participate in the distribution of Ameripay’s assets.

Public entities with concerns and questions about protecting their rights in the Ameripay bankruptcy are urged to contact the Scarinci Hollenbeck attorney with whom they work. Questions can also be directed to <a title=""Joel R. Glucksman"" href=""/attorneys/partners/joel-r-glucksman/"">Joel Glucksman</a>, Joseph Donegan, or <a title=""Sheri K.

3839,"Best Practices Guidelines Update","Following the March 4, 2010 release of the report from the New Jersey State Comptroller, ""Best Practices for Award of Service Contracts"" Scarinci Hollenbeck allerted our public clients to the likelihood that the State Comptroller would likely use it as a benchmark procedure for municipalities to follow when awarding municipal service contracts otherwise exempt from public bidding. We recommended strict compliance with the procedures set forth in the report, created a checklist and training template consistent with the report, and warned that there might be consequences for non compliance. We were right!

Less than one year later, on February 1, 2011, the Office of the State Comptroller notified the City of Hoboken that their ""fair and open"" process did not comply with their the State's ""Best Practices"" guidelines as follows:

The City failed to convene an evaluation committee to score the competing proposals.

Although the City's RFQs clearly stated the selection criteria, the City did not document its evaluations using that criteria.

The City failed to use scoring sheets to document how the proposals were scored by each member of the evaluation committee.

The City officials involved in the award process were not provided with any instructions, guidelines or procedures to guide their award decisions consistent with ""best practices.""

The City failed to maintain written recommendations concerning which vendors should receive the contracts awarded as a result of the evaluation.

The State has required the City of Hoboken to prepare a detailed action plan to explain how they will address these issues. The state will continue to monitor the city and required the city to provide 30 days advance notice before advertisement of any future professional service contracts.

We again most urgently recommend that you review your procedures for awarding professional service contracts and adopt a procedure with training to comply with the ""best practice"" guidelines. We are available to assist you if needed.

3841,"Beware When Dealing with Bankrupts: The Bank's Liens Always Come First","The United States Court of Appeals has severely reprimanded a company which innocently sold goods to a bankrupt. This reinforces the need for extreme care in doing business with someone in bankruptcy.

Delco Oil filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October. Its secured lender, CapitalSource Finance, had a pre-bankruptcy lien on all assets, including inventory, receivables, and cash. Delco asked the bankruptcy court for permission to use its cash to continue business operations. The court refused. However, in the six weeks between the bankruptcy filing and the court’s refusal, Delco bought new inventory from Marathon Petroleum and paid Marathon nearly $2 million. Marathon admittedly had no idea that CapitalSource claimed a lien in Delco’s cash.

The Bankruptcy Code holds a debtor’s cash and cash equivalents to be a secured lender’s “cash collateral.” The Code prohibits a debtor from using “cash collateral” – even in the ordinary course of business - unless the lender consents or the court so directs. Neither occurred in Delco’s case. In fact, the bankruptcy trustee sued Marathon for the $2 million.

The court, in Marathon Petroleum Company v. Cohen, found for the trustee, despite Marathon in good faith having delivered goods worth the full $2 million. As the court noted, the Bankruptcy Code contains nothing excusing Marathon because of good faith or provision of fair value.

The Bankruptcy Code generally lets a bankrupt continue to operate its business. That being said, one must exercise due care to avoid being in Marathon’s position. If in doubt, consult counsel.",,20110225,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/beware-when-dealing-with-bankrupts-the-banks-liens-always-come-first/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates","Bankruptcy|Bankruptcy Code|CapitalSource|Chapter 11|Delco Oil|fair value|Marathon Petroleum Company v.

3843,"OPEN PUBLIC MEETINGS ACT UPDATE","<strong>Chain E-Mails May Violate The Act</strong>

Recently the Gloucester County, Cape May County and Burlington County Prosecutors' offices independently concluded that e-mails between members of a governing body are covered by the Open Public Meetings Act (""OPMA""). Knowing violations of the Open Public Meetings Act may result in a fine of $100.00 for the first offense and between a $100.00 and $500.00 for each subsequent offense.

In Gloucester County, four council members decided via e-mail to pay a gas bill. This was found to be a violation of the law because the public was deprived of its right to be present when the council was ""deliberating"" on the bill. Similarly, in Burlington County the prosecutor opined that the Township officials ""unwittingly"" ran afoul of the prohibitions contained in the Open Public Meetings Act. In that case all five council members engaged in an ongoing dialogue via a string of e-mails. The prosecutor concluded that the Township officials inadvertently convened a meeting contrary to the Open Public Meetings Act. In Cape May County the e-mails in question concerned the proposed ad including qualifications for the position of Township Manager. The e-mail asked for a positive response from a majority of the council to approve the proposed ad for posting in the local paper and websites. The Cape May Prosecutor noted that some council members were previously advised to avoid using e-mails and accordingly deemed the violation ""disturbing"".

The fact that three prosecutors have now independently reviewed this issue, clearly places elected officials on notice that the use of e-mail, text, or instant messaging may constitute a ""meeting"" for purposes of the Open Public Meetings Act. Public Entities need to develop written guidelines for the use of e-mails and other electronic communication. The Burlington County Prosecutor recommended that these written guidelines include at a minimum the following:
<ol>
<li>E-mail communications should, as far as practicable, not include an effective majority of the governing body and should never include an effective majority of the governing body where discussion of information related to the business of the municipal is involved.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Where e-mail communications do include an effective majority of the governing body, such communications should not include any request for a response. In fact, any e-mail communication should indicate that there should be no e-mail reply or other responsive communication.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>In the rare instance when a response to an e-mail is necessary, such response must not involve any decision-making or deliberative function of the governing body or otherwise address public business as contemplated by the OPMA. Further, the response shall not be made to the entire list of email addressees to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Utilizing a third party, such as the Clerk, does not change the requirements of the OPMA.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>""Rolling"" e-mail conversations must also be avoided. A ""rolling"" e-mail occurs when one (1) member of the governing body or a third party contacts other members via e-mail individually to successively discuss or gain opinions on an item of municipal business. This would apply to other forms of electronic communications as well. However, communications between less than an effective majority of the governing body do not violate the OPMA provided the dialogue does not become a ""rolling"" discussion that ends up including an effective majority of the governing body.</li>
</ol>
We recommend public entities consider adopting guidelines for the use of e-mails, texting or other electronic communication to avoid possible violations of the Open Public Meetings Act. Please contact our office for help drafting this policy

3847,"Champion Enterprises Files Bankruptcy","On November 15, 2009, Champion Enterprises and 17 related United States entities filed Chapter 11 bankruptcies in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

Champion is an international manufacturer of factory-built homes and modular buildings. According to the filed Declaration of its Chief Financial Officer Phyllis Knight, Champion intends at present to market its United States businesses for sale “in whole or in part.” Champion also intends, during this period, “to continue to operate their business in the ordinary course and work to maximize the value of their assets for the benefit of creditors.”

In connection with its attempt to keep operating, on November 17th Champion obtained a bankruptcy court order allowing it to begin accessing additional financing from its lenders. The bankruptcy court also let Champion continue honoring various customer programs, including its HUD obligations, its warranty programs, and its dealer Volume Incentives. Finally, Champion was authorized to honor its customer deposits.

The bankruptcy court, however, imposed limits on the amount of money that Champion could spend for its customer programs or for customer deposits. Accordingly, persons holding claims against Champion under these programs, or for customer deposits, are urged to proceed rapidly to enforce their rights.

The Champion bankruptcies are brand new and subject to rapid development. If you have a financial stake in what happens to Champion, you need to consider how to protect your rights.

3849,"Domicile is Like Inertia","<strong>By <a title=""Frank L. Brunetti"" href=""/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/"">Frank L. Brunetti</a> </strong>| Wikipedia defines ""inertia"" as the resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion or rest. It is represented numerically by an object's mass. The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles of classical physics which are used to describe the motion of matter and how it is affected by applied forces. Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, or lazy. Sir Isaac Newton defined inertia in Definition 3 of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which states:
<blockquote>The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line.</blockquote>
In my review of New Jersey and New York law I have found that like ""inertia,"" domicile has a tendency to remain in a state of motion or rest. Once a person establishes a domicile it is very difficult for it to change.

The New Jersey Experience

N.J.S.A. 54A:1-2(m) defines a resident taxpayer as an individual:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>who is domiciled in the State, unless
<ol type=""i"">
	<li>he maintains no permanent place of abode in this State,</li>
	<li>maintains a permanent place of abode elsewhere, and</li>
	<li>spends in the aggregate no more than 30 days of the taxable year in this State (subdivisions added); or</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>who is not domiciled in this State but maintains a permanent place of abode in this State and spends in the aggregate more than 183 days of the taxable year in this State, unless such individual is in the Armed Forces of the United States.</li>
</ol>
Thus a resident is either (i) a domiciliary (unless he or she meets all three conditions in N.J.S.A. 54A:1-2(m)(1) or (2) a nondomiciliary who maintains a permanent place of abode and more than 183 days of the taxable year in this State. An individual who does not fit within the parameters of N.J.S.A. 54A:1-2(m) is a nonresident taxpayer. N.J.S.A. 54A:1-2(n).

It's important to note that a resident taxpayer is subject to the NJ-GIT on income derived from all sources. N.J.S.A.54A:5-1, ""domicile alone…affords an adequate basis for the taxation of income.""<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">
Hough v. Director of Div. of Taxation</span>, 2 NJ Tax 67, 72 (Tax Ct. 1980). An individual's income is taxable without regard to its source. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Estate of Guzzardi v. Director of Div. of Taxation</span>, 15 NJ Tax 395, 397 (Tax Ct. 1995).

Consequently, the resident who derives income that is taxed by other jurisdictions is afforded the resident tax credit against the New Jersey tax for eligible taxes paid to other jurisdictions. N.J.S.A.54A:4-1(a).

A person who is not a New Jersey resident is taxed only to the extent of income derived form New Jersey sources. N.J.S.A.54A:2-1.1.

New Jersey Courts have often provided a detailed analysis of the terms ""domicile"" and ""resident."" These terms are nor interchangeable for NJ-GIT purposes because a person can have only one domicile. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Geoffredo v. Director of Div. of Taxation</span>, 9 NJ Tax 135, 139 (Tax Ct.1987)

In Goffredo, the tax court discussed the differences between domicile and residence:

""Domicile"" and ""residence"" are related terms and although in certain contexts are used interchangeably, they are not legally identical. Domicile is defined as:
<blockquote>That place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning. The permanent residence of a person or the place to which he intends to return even though he may actually reside elsewhere. A person may have more than one residence but only one domicile.</blockquote>
Additionally, ""domicile"" is compared and distinguished from ""residence"" by Black's [Law Dictionary] as follows:
<blockquote>As ""domicile"" and ""residence"" are usually in the same place, they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile. Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home. Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an intention to make it one's domicile. ""Residence"" is not synonymous with ""domicile,"" though the two terms are closely related; a person may have only one legal domicile at one time, but he may have more than one residence. Id. at 140.</blockquote>
In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Lyon v. Glaser</span>, 60 N.J. 259, 288 A.2d 12 (1972), the New Jersey Supreme Court wrote:
<blockquote>Domicile is very much a mater of the mind-of intention. One may be acquired, or change to a new one, when there is a concurrence of certain elements; i.e., an actual and physical taking up of an abode in a particular State, accompanied by an intention to make his home there permanently or at least indefinitely, and to abandon his old domicile. A person has the right to choose his own domicile, and his motive in doing so is immaterial. The change may be made to avoid taxation, so long as the necessary ingredients for establishment of the new domicile are present. A very short period of residence in a given place may be sufficient to show domicile, <strong>but mere residence, regardless of its length, is not sufficient</strong>. It has been said that concurrence, even for a moment, of physical presence at a dwelling place with the intention of making it a permanent abode, effects a change of domicile. And once established, the domicile continues until a new one is found to have been acquired through an application of the same tests. Since the concept of domicile involves the concurrence of physical presence in a particular State, and an intention to make that State one's home, determination of a disputed issue on the subject requires an evaluation of all the facts and circumstances of the case. Id. at 264-65, 288 A.2d 12 (citations and footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>
In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Gruodis v. Director</span>, New Jersey Division of Taxation; Dkt. No. A-5370-04T3, 08/03/2006 , the taxpayer was born in Lithuania in 1942 and moved to the United States as a child. He maintains dual citizenship, went to school in the United States, including college, married a United States citizen, his first wife Carol, and had two children in the United States. From 1983 to 1998, Victor and Carol maintained a primary residence with their two children in River Vale, New Jersey.

In 1998, Carol died and in 1999 Victor became engaged to a Lithuanian citizen, Ausra. The New Jersey house was in Carol's name and was never transferred to Victor after her death.

Notwithstanding Mr. Gruodis' home outside of Vilnius, Lithuania had not been completed until the end of the year 2000. Mr. Gruodis urges the court to accept that his new domicile was Ausra's apartment, or prior to that, the apartments rented for him by one Omnitel. Yet, for a number of years prior to 2000, Mr. Gruodis continued to live in the same manner, going back and forth from New Jersey to Lithuania.

The court said: ""While it is true that a person has a right to choose his domicile, and the motives for his choice are immaterial to a determination of domicile, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wolff v. Taxation Div. Director</span>, 9 N.J. Tax 11 (Tax 1986) , 'declarations of domicile motivated by tax considerations may be carefully scrutinized and readily rejected when negated by the objective circumstances."" 9 N.J. Tax at 297 quoting Lyon, supra, 60 N.J. at 281.

After reviewing all the evidence the Appellate Court held Mr. Gruodis:
<ul type=""circle"">
<ul type=""circle"">
	<li>Retained and maintained the River Vale residence for his son and for his business relations,</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul type=""circle"">

	<li>Claimed and received a New Jersey Saver rebate,</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul type=""circle"">
	<li>Was married in New Jersey and used the River Vale address as his residence on the New Jersey marriage license.</li>
</ul>
Considering all the evidence as a whole, this court found that taxpayers did not effect a change of domicile in the year 2000.

Illustrative of the efforts needed to change domicile is recited in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">O'Hara v. Director</span>, New Jersey Division of Taxation; 60 NJ 239 (1972). In O'Hara the New Jersey Supreme Court noted the taxpayer took the following steps:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>In early May 1969 she advised her former employer that she had moved to Florida and requested that the retirement checks be sent to 9801 West Suburban Drive, Miami, Florida (the home of Meredith O'Hara). This is corroborated by the employer's affidavit, which states in addition that ""she unquestionably intended to remain in Florida the rest of her life,"" and so he changed all of his records accordingly.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>She rented a safe deposit box in a South Miami bank on May 26, 1969, and transferred to it all of her securities and important papers, from her box in a New York bank.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>She requested Meredith O'Hara to sell her house in Westfield; and according to the first floor tenant, Mrs. Haney, he endeavored to sell it to them.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>She opened a brokerage account with the Miami office of a national brokerage firm on June 12, 1969.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>She opened a checking account in a South Miami bank.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>In each of the above transactions she gave the same Miami address.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>On June 25, 1969 she executed a Declaration of Domicile and Citizenship in Dade County, Florida, and filed it with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of that County. The certificate was signed and sworn to by Miss Johnston and recites that she was formerly a resident of Westfield, New Jersey, that she had changed her domicile to and had become a bona fide resident of the State of Florida residing at Meredith O'Hara's address, since May 3, 1969 (the date should have been May 4), and that she had no intention of returning to her former domicile but intended to remain in Miami, Florida, permanently.</li>
</ol>
The court also noted that on May 3 (the year of her death) she went to her house with Meredith and packed up her clothes, records, correspondence, family photographs, Christmas card lists and jewelry to take to Florida with her. She removed everything except the furniture, which was of little value (it was appraised at $95 after her death). She said good-bye to her tenants, the Haneys, and as Mrs. Haney said, it was quite apparent that she was leaving for good, and intended to establish her home in Florida.

Based on the clear steps taken by the taxpayer the Supreme court determined that the New Jersey domicile had been abandoned in favor of Florida.

In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Samuelsson v. Director Division of Taxation</span>, 22 NJ Tax 243 (Tax 2004), the taxpayer was a professional hockey player for the Philadelphia Flyers. After obtaining a job with the Tampa Bay Lightning, he and his family moved from their New Jersey home to Florida. They moved all furniture and belongings, put their house up for sale, looked for a house in Florida, enrolled their children in a Florida school, but never actually purchased a Florida house or sold their New Jersey house. They eventually returned to their New Jersey house and retained New Jersey as their domicile. However, they contested the Director's assertion that New Jersey remained their domicile for the year they had resided in Florida. The court found that the Samuelssons had abandoned their New Jersey domicile, even though they had not sold their house. An important distinction in Samuelsson was that the taxpayers closed all their New Jersey bank accounts and opened Florida accounts, Mr. Samuelsson changed his driver's licenses to Florida, registered his car in Florida and left the house empty during the period of abandonment.

No person is ever without a domicile in the eyes of the law, and a person is presumed to be domiciled in his domiciliary state until a new domicile is acquired. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Lyon v. Glaser</span>, 60 N.J. 259, 277, 288 A.2d 12 (1972).

There can be no establishment of a new domicile unless there is proof of an intent to abandon an original domicile. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Bowman v. DuBose</span>, 267 F.Supp. 312, 313-314 (D.S.C. 1967); <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Citizens State Bank and Trust Co. v. Glaser</span>, 70 N.J. 72, 81, 357 A.2d 753 (1976); <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Lyon v. Glaser</span>, supra 60 N.J. at 264, 288 A.2d 12. Any disputed issue on the subject requires an evaluation of all the facts and circumstances of the case. Id. at 264-265, 288 A.2d 12.

The abandonment or change of one's domicile for another must be by clear steps taken by the taxpayer; like inertia it takes considerable force to exact a change.

<strong>The New York Experience</strong>

It seems that in interpreting the elements of domicile the New York Department of Taxation has also incorporated the laws of physics. No matter how hard one may try it is very difficult to change domicile in New York once established.

As outlined in the New York Department of Taxation and Finance Publication No. 88 dated December 1, 2010 a person can only have one domicile. As it has often been put ""domicile is the place you intend to have as your permanent home."" A change in domicile must be clear and convincing. New York uses a number of qualitative and quantitative factors are used to determine if there is a change in domicile including:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The size, value and nature of use of your first residence to the size, value and nature of use of your newly acquired residence</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Your employment and/or business connections in both locations</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The amount of time spent in both locations;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The physical location of items that have significant sentimental value to you in both locations; and</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Your close family ties in both locations.</li>
</ul>
New York says the change of domicile is clear and convincing only when the taxpayer's primary ties are clearly greater in the new location. This test, that is ""clearly Greater"" imposes a very high standard and like inertia requires a significant force to move.

Difficulty arises when a taxpayer intends to change his domicile from New York to another state such as Florida. Often such person may keep his New York home or apartment and purchase or rent a residence in another state such as Florida or Texas. Under these circumstances it is difficult for a taxpayer to establish a domicile in another state and become New York non-residents.

When we counsel clients regarding domicile we often advise client to change their financial contacts, their driver's license, voter registration, address for tax filings, their church or synagogue, etc. As often repeated in case law regarding change in domicile, ""formal declarations have been held less persuasive then informal acts of an individual's habit of life."" Matter of Silverman, Tax Appeal Tribunal, April 6, 1995.

While the standard regarding change of domicile is both objective and subjective, the courts and the Tax Appeals Tribunal have consistently looked to certain objective criteria to determine whether a taxpayer's general habits of living demonstrate a change of domicile. Among the factors that have been considered are:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The retention of a permanent place of abode in New York</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Continued business activity in New York</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Family ties in New York</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Continuing social and community ties in New York; and</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Formal declarations of domicile.</li>
</ol>
Indeed, In the Matter of Slotkis, Tax Appeal Tribunal, March 7, 2002, the taxpayers:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Changed their voting registration</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Changed their drivers' licenses</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Filed for a Florida exemption from the ad valorem tax and homestead exemption</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Executed new Wills, Revocable Trusts, Durable Powers of Attorney and Health Care Surrogate Designations using their Florida address</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Filed their US income tax return using their Florida address</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Spent 217 days in Florida and 140 days in New York.</li>
</ul>
The court noted in finding that New York was the taxpayers' domicile:
<blockquote>There is no indicating in the record that petitioners intended to sever their New York ties or that they possessed the requisite intent to make Florida their fixed and permanent home. Three of their four children as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren resided in the New York metropolitan area. Their grandchildren were described as ""their sole source of pleasure."" Petitioners retained their home in Brooklyn, New York. They intended to keep this home to use during their visits to New York, especially during the spring and summer months when they felt it was too hot in Florida. Petitioners spent 148 days in New York during 1997, the vast majority of those between April and September. This was only a minor change in their travel patters from the year 1995, the year prior to Mrs. Slotkis's stroke, in which they spent approximately six months in New York during the spring, summer and autumn months at a time when they still considered themselves domiciled in New York.

Petitioners did not take any of their furniture from their Brooklyn house to Florida, as they intended to continue to use this home during their stays in New York. This is a strong factor in deciding that they did not intend to give up their New York domicile and make the Florida condominium their permanent home.</blockquote>
The court concluded that the taxpayers' declaration of a Florida domicile was undermined by their general habit of life in which New York remained their permanent home. The continued maintenance of their Brooklyn home, the large amount of time spent in New York during the year, the lack of any significant change in their travel schedules before and after they claimed to have changed their domicile and the importance of being with their family in New York all serve to negate an intent to give up their New York domicile or to acquire a new domicile in Florida. Accordingly, the court found that the taxpayers continued to be domicile in New York.

Because of the heavy burden the law places on an individual asserting a change of domicile, it appears that unless one actually leaves New York, close down an apartment or sell his house, move furniture, change all contacts, severely limit the time in New York and contact with children and grandchildren it is more likely than not that one will be unable to change their domicile.

One factor which may establish a change in domicile might be a new employment position. Nevertheless a court will look very closely at such an arrangement to determine if it is one of substance. A court would look at whether the job is full time and the amount of remuneration expected and received and whether a new position is real or just ""window dressing."" As said in the Matter of Reid, Tax Appeal Tribunal, December 27, 1994:
<blockquote>One factor which may establish a change in domicile might be a new employment position. Nevertheless a court will look very closely at such an arrangement to determine if it is one of substance. A court would look at whether the job is full time and the amount of remuneration expected and received and whether a new position is real or just ""window dressing."" As said in the Matter of Reid, Tax Appeal Tribunal, December 27, 1994:
<ul>A change of domicile may be made through caprice, whim or fancy, for business, health or pleasure, to secure a change of climate, or a change of laws, or for any reason whatever, provided there is an absolute and fixed intention to abandon one and acquire another and the acts of the person affected confirm the intention .... No pretense or deception can be practiced, for the intention must be honest, the action genuine and the evidence to establish both, clear and convincing. The animus manendi must be actual with no animo revertendi ....</ul>
</blockquote>
Indeed a move to another country has been held insufficient to establish a new domicile. In the Matter of the Petition of Taylor, NYS Division of Tax Appeals, ALJ, 822824, 07/08/2010 the taxpayer did not prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that during the years at issue she gave up her long-time New York City domicile and acquired a new domicile as her fixed and permanent home in London. The taxpayer, who owned two homes in New York, accepted a position with her employer that required her to live in London for many years. The taxpayer's initial choice to accept, and subsequently extend for many years, a position in London appeared to have resulted from the opportunity for career advancement offered there rather than from a desire to live in London. However, subsequent to the years at issue the taxpayer purchased a home in London and decided to make it her permanent home. Under NYCRR Title 20 §105.20(d)(3), a New York domiciliary who goes abroad because of a work assignment does not lose his or her New York domicile unless it is clearly shown that the intent is to remain abroad permanently and not to return. The court determined that the facts of the case did not compel a conclusion that the taxpayer was committed to staying in London without any intent to return to New York, where she continued to retain two residences, including her historic place of domicile, or to move elsewhere.

3857,"Governor Signs Bill Increasing Oversight of Publicly Funded Redevelopment and Remediation Projects","<strong>By <a href=""/attorneys/partners/patrick-j-mcnamara/"" title=""Patrick J. McNamara"">Patrick J. McNamara</a></strong> | Governor Jon Corzine recently signed into law Assembly Bill 2650. The bill was developed in response to the issues that were uncovered in the various investigations regarding the financial transactions surrounding the now-bankrupt EnCap Golf project.

The new law is designed to prevent the misuse of public funds used for redevelopment or remediation projects and requires private entities receiving over $50 million in public funding by grant and/or loan to comply with stricter reporting standards designed to provide much greater transparency when the use of public funds is involved with such projects.
<strong>
Requirements</strong>

For developers and redevelopers that meet or exceed the financial assistance threshold for qualifying public contracts, the following rules and requirements are now imposed:
<ol>
<li>For the total spending on project costs, the developer must contribute at least $1.00 from other sources for every $5.00 derived from the public entity supporting the project;</li>
<br>
<li>The public entity providing funding would be required to retain up to 10% of the amount of the assistance provided pending completion of the project, subject to any regulatory requirements for retention or escrow of a greater amount;</li>
<br>
<li>The public entity would have to review the qualifications of project subcontractors hired to perform work on the project;</li>
<br>
<li>The developer must post a performance bond equal to at least 110% of the cost of the publicly funded improvements under the project;</li>
<br>
<li>The developer must file audited financial statements annually for the project and for the business itself, and would have to continue to do so annually throughout the life of the project. The business, as well as the auditor performing the work, would have to comply with various financial reporting and business auditor requirements similar to those imposed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and</li>
<br>
<li>The office of the State Comptroller is authorized to audit the business’s use of any public funds to which the legislation would apply and expenditure of other funds on the project.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Failure to Submit Financial Statement or Report</strong>

The law also provides that any recipient business that knowingly fails to submit a financial statement or report, or makes any material misrepresentation in any application, report, or other disclosure it is required to make under the bill, would have to refund the entire amount of financial assistance provided by a granting public entity. If the public entity had to pursue a refund, the law provides that it can recoup its attorney fees and other costs in pursuing such an action. The developer is also required to ensure the preservation of all documents pertaining to the funding and use of said funding on the project.

<strong>Legislative Fiscal Estimate</strong>

It is worth noting that the legislative fiscal estimate prepared for the bill could not quantify the fiscal impact of the legislation. It did acknowledge that the bill would effectively create an insurance policy for governmental entities providing funding above the $50 million threshold for redevelopment, remediation or environmental infrastructure projects. The statement also noted that it would regularly increase the cost to State and local governments in undertaking such projects, as the size of the assistance to contractors would rise along with the governmental costs of administering the contracts. It also noted that the Treasury Department would incur additional costs as it will become the central depository for all required documents.

The bill gives the Treasury Department the authority to coordinate the administration of contracts signed by governmental entities. It would also increase the contracting governmental entity’s cost of administrating the contract for review and management of the documents in question. The fiscal estimate also noted that for privately held companies, the reporting and auditing requirements that parallel the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would impose a greater cost. The fiscal estimate goes on to state:

<blockquote>“All these new requirements could erect a barrier for entry for potential competitors, especially for businesses that are not publicly traded. Instead of complying with the new standards, firms may decide to avoid the additional expense by not seeking to undertake a project. Fewer contracting options would hence exist for public entities. Having acquired more pricing power, the remaining competitors could angle for a more significant mark up by demanding more public assistance as a condition of undertaking a project.”</blockquote>

<strong>Available Grants and Loans</strong>

Given the current state of the economy and the financial markets, developers are now looking for various sources of grants and loans that are offered by State agencies such as the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, as well as assistance from local municipalities and utility authorities. Any developer looking to assemble such funding now must take into account the potential transactional cost and the need to retain the appropriate professionals with backgrounds in areas that public financing, auditing and financial management in order to comply with this new law. There has not been an announcement yet from the Department of Treasury as to when it expects to have implementing regulations in place to manage this program.

3860,"Estimated Gains Tax on Real Estate Sales Now Required at Closing","<strong>By <a title=""Mark K. Follender"" href=""/attorneys/partners/mark-k-follender/"">Mark K. Follender</a></strong> | On August 1, 2007, the New Jersey Legislature adopted N.J.S.A. 54:50-38, which modified the reporting requirements of a sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business. Previously, N.J.S.A. 54:32B-22(c) imposed a reporting duty only on businesses required to collect sales and use tax and escrow notifications and clearance waivers were issued based solely upon any tax deficiency found to be due. This was expanded to include commercially used real estate assets of a business being sold, considering the sale of business-owned real estate as part of the bulk sale of an operating business. The direction from the Division as of August 2007 required that even single asset real estate entities file the new form C-9600, however, in a transaction in which the sale of real estate was unrelated to an organized business operation, no escrow would be required because of the lack of a sales tax or employers wage tax component. In large part, that position of the State was consistently applied and the transferee filing the C-9600 in a pure real estate transaction routinely received a no escrow letter from the State.

<strong>New Rules</strong>

Late last year, the Division changed its position, signifying a dramatic change in the method for collection of tax on gains realized from the sale of real estate. The Division now asserts that all real estate sales for real estate primarily used for business operations made not in the ordinary course of business, including single asset entities unattached to an ongoing business, will be reviewed at the time of sale, not only for tax deficiencies (which are largely aimed at operating entities), but also to the amount of any capital gain estimated on the sale of the real estate.

While in the past, New Jersey resident sellers of real estate paid taxes on gain in the normal course of filing tax returns, this is no longer the case. The State asserts it will impose on the purchaser’s attorney, an escrow obligation equal to the amount of gain as estimated by the State upon review of form C-9600 and the contract of sale supplied with the form. Payment of the tax is now due at the time of closing. Purchases failing to comply with this new directive risk imposition of a payment obligation for a seller’s unpaid capital gains and other taxes.

<strong>TTD Form</strong>

In order to forestall an unusually large escrow demand by the State, the State has developed form TTD which may be submitted separately by the Seller prior to closing. Form TTD (Asset Transfer Tax Declaration) is a declaration of estimated tax by the taxpayer. The form requires that each member, partner or shareholder of the selling entity complete a separate TTD. Accordingly, any entity or individual receiving a K-1 must comply. In addition, the TTD to be filed by the Seller is considered confidential and not a form that the Seller needs to share with the Purchaser.
<strong>
Unanswered Questions</strong>

The practical implementation of this new regulation is producing various anomalies that require treatment on a case by case basis. For example, what is to be done when there will be no closing proceeds such as the sale of real estate for less than the mortgage amount or in the instance of a Purchaser paying nominal consideration for environmentally contaminated property? Additionally, the requirement that each member of the entity complete a TTD declaration can be cumbersome when the entity is comprised of numerous members or partners. The Division is still considering methods for streamlining the process without compromising the effectiveness.

Sellers, purchasers and their attorneys need to become familiar with the requirements involved with the new rules and the Asset Transfer Tax Declaration form in order to avoid surprises at the time of closing and liability for unpaid taxes.

3868,"First Amendment Protections to Speakers in a Public Forum","In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Philip A. Bessler, et. al. v. Board of Education of West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District et. al</span>. (A-81-08), ____N.J. ____ (2010), the New Jersey Supreme Court decided two questions of constitutional importance:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>To what extent may government regulate those who wish to express their views about government at a public meeting?</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>To what extent does the interest in running an orderly meeting justify the suppression of a speaker?</li>
</ol>
In this case, the plaintiff complained at various meetings of the board of education that his daughter, a high school student, was being verbally abused by her basketball coach, and he questioned what he saw as a “double standard” in having a code of appropriate language for students using the internet but not having a similar code of conduct for coaches. At one meeting, before the meeting was opened to the public, the board president announced that each speaker had only five (5) minutes to speak. Various speakers addressed the board for longer than five (5) minutes, one for more than twelve (12) minutes, on different subjects, without interruption. Before hearing from the plaintiff, the board president announced that the purpose of the comment period was not to discuss personnel, staff behavior or litigation, and the chair reserved the right to cut-off any speaker who raised those subjects. When the plaintiff brought up the board’s policy regarding “abusive language”, thirty seconds into his speech, he was called out of order by the board president who refused to entertain those comments and was not allowed to complete his speech.

Plaintiff and his daughter sued the board of education, board officials and employees. He alleged that the board had violated his right of free speech guaranteed under the First Amendment in violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. After a trial, the jury entered a verdict against the Board on the plaintiff’s First Amendment claims and awarded $100,000.00 in damages for pain and suffering. The Board appealed. The “critical issue” to the Appellate Division was whether the Board’s restriction in plaintiff’s speech was content-based or content-neutral. “In other words, the jury had to decide whether the Board restricted Bessler’s speech because of the content of what he had to say or because it was merely conducting an orderly and efficient meeting.” The court found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury’s finding of a violation of plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. It did not address the Board’s appeal to reverse the damage award as excessive.

The Supreme Court granted certification. In its analysis of First Amendment protections, the Court observed that “One of the core purposes of the First Amendment is to protect speech on matters of public interest, including speech that the government finds offensive. (cits. omitted). Freedom of speech, therefore, protects not just the speech that we find agreeable, but also the speech that we hate.”

While the Court acknowledged that the “right to free speech is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitations” to restrict or curtail a speaker in a content-neutral manner who is “disruptive”, or who attempts to “hijack” or “filibuster” the meeting with “irrelevant or repetitious speech”, it issued this warning:

“Significantly, once a governmental entity, such as a school board, opens the floor for discussion of relevant matters of public interest and concern, it may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use of a forum to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.”

The Court applied the standard in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Monell v. the Department of Social Services</span>, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. .2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d. 611 (1978), making a public entity responsible for the acts of its employees or agencies who are final decision makers for the public body and concluded that the board president and the other board members were the “final policymakers for the Board of Education”; and therefore, the board was liable for his acts in silencing the plaintiff at the meeting. The Court pointed out that none of the other board members objected to the board president’s actions, and therefore, “their silence ratified” the action to silence the plaintiff. Furthermore, as the jury had rejected the argument that the plaintiff was silenced in order to conduct an “orderly” meeting the Court determined that, there was sufficient evidence to find that the chair’s comments, before Bessler was permitted to speak, “revealed impatience and antagonism toward a viewpoint he did not want to hear.”

The Court affirmed that part of the Appellate Division’s judgment that upheld the jury’s finding that plaintiff’s First Amendment rights at the meeting were violated. It reversed and remanded the Court’s denial of the Board’s motion for a remittitur of the damage award.

The Bessler decision emphasizes the right of free expression in a public forum. As to the competing interest which allegedly justifies the suppression of a public speaker, courts will scrutinize regulations that limit expression of speech to assure that the government is not attempting to control the content of speech.",,20110617,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/first-amendment-protections-to-speakers-in-a-public-forum/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates",,publish,10,first-amendment-protections-to-speakers-in-a-public-forum,,,0,0,open,closed
3870,"Governor Christie Signs Legislation Amending Municipal Land Use Law Regarding the Time of Application Rules","<strong>By <a title=""Patrick J. McNamara"" href=""/attorneys/partners/patrick-j-mcnamara/"">Patrick J. McNamara</a></strong> | Governor Christie has signed Assembly Bill 437 (S-82) which amends the Municipal Land Use Law to preclude a municipality from amending its land development ordinances to adversely impact an application for development that has been filed before a local land use board. The legislation states that the land use ordinances that are in effect on the date of the submission of an application for development shall govern the review of that application and any decision made by a planning board or zoning board of adjustment regarding the application. Any provision of a land use ordinance, except those relating to health and public safety, which is adopted after the date the application has been submitted shall not apply to the application for development. New Jersey was only one of a handful of states that had not yet enacted this type of legislation.

It is important to note that this statute will not take effect until May of 2011. Thus, the prudent course for a municipality would be to undertake an examination of its current land use ordinances by way of master plan re-examination to determine whether these ordinances are suitable for the long range needs of the municipality. Once that is accomplished, then the municipality can proceed to undertake enacting the requisite amendments to its land use ordinances.

3872,"Identity Theft Policy Requirements for Local Government","<strong>By Thomas A. Segreto</strong> | In response to the growing threat of identity theft, Congress adopted the Fair and Accurate Trade Act of 2003 (FACT), which is administered and enforced by the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FACT applies to many facets of consumer transactions involving credit. Years later, the FTC promulgated the final rules, known as “Red Flag” rules. The FTC has advised that all financial institutions and creditors with covered accounts must have their written identity theft policies implemented by November 1, 2009.

<strong>Creditors</strong>

Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681a (r)(5), a creditor is defined in the same way as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which is defined as “any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit.” This broad definition potentially includes within its scope, local government agencies and utilities.

<strong>Covered Accounts</strong>

The State of New Jersey has recognized that certain Local Governments and utilities (including but not necessarily limited to government wastewater, water, electrical utilities or other utilities which bill after receipt of services) are covered by the FACT. For example, a municipality with a water department that provides water to users and bills those users on a monthly basis according to water usage would need to adopt an identity theft policy with regard to the covered accounts in the water department. The local government agency must adopt an identity theft red flag policy by November 1, 2009.

<strong>Features of a Compliant Policy</strong>

The keystone features of a compliant identity theft policy incorporates the identification of potential sources of delineated red flags, detection of the red flags, prevention and mitigation of possible identity theft and review of policies to address then present circumstances in which there is a potential for identity theft. While the State of New Jersey has suggested a model Identity Theft Policy, each local government agency which falls within the scope of FACT must adopt a policy which fits its operational needs and circumstances.

<strong>OPRA Implications</strong>

There are Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et esq. (OPRA) implications to the adoption of identity theft policies and any policy which is intended to be compliant with FACT must also address OPRA implications. Custodians of Records must be vigilant to ensure that sensitive information is redacted from government records in accordance with the FACT and the local government agency’s identity theft policy.

<strong>Enforcement</strong>

The FTC may pursue enforcement against creditors who fail to implement a written identity theft policy though an “unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce” action. Aside from a Cease and desist order, civil penalties for violations may be imposed up to a maximum of $2,500 per offense. For local units that obtain consumer credit reports of customers, failure to comply with the regulations pertaining to address discrepancy could result in penalties not exceeding $1,000.

3874,"Implementation of Healthcare Contributions by Public Employees Pursuant to P.L. 2010, c. 2","In March 2010, the Governor signed P.L. 2010, c. 2 into law which implemented pension and health insurance reform for public employees within this State. The Law amended eighteen (18) sections of the State Health Benefits Program, Title 40A and Title 18A, with the effective date of May 21, 2010, the Divisions of Pensions and Benefits and Local Government Services have recently issued guidance on implementing the law. Generally, the Law provides:
<ul>
<li>The cost of employee health benefits shall be shared by public employees through the withholding of 1.5% of an employee’s base salary. </li>
<br>
<li>The reimbursement for waiving health coverage is reduced to 25% of the cost of the premium or $5000.00, whichever is less. </li>
<br>
<li>The 1.5% contribution is not required if an employee waives health coverage. </li>
<br>
<li>Employees covered by a current applicable collective negotiations agreement will commence the 1.5% contribution upon the expiration of that agreement. </li>
</ul>
 The two most prevalent questions which arise are: 
<ul>
<li>When the contribution becomes effective for employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. </li>
<br>
<li>How the Law treats non-aligned employees. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Union Employees</strong>

Unionized employees who are covered by a current collective bargaining agreement, in effect on May 21, 2010, do not begin the 1.5% contribution until the expiration of the contract. Employees covered by a collective negotiations agreement which expired prior to May 21, 2010 and who have not ratified a successor contract by May 21, 2010 will begin the contribution on May 21, 2010. 

<strong>Non-aligned Employees</strong>

The Law has generated much confusion in relation to non-aligned employees. In fact, the Law, and the guidance offered by the Divisions of Pensions and Benefits (“Pensions”) and the Division of Local Government Services (“LGS”), conflicts in relation to the effective date of the contribution made by employees who are not members of a union. As discussed below, part of the confusion results from the provisions of the Law which affect State Health Benefits Program (including School Employees Health Benefits Program) (“SHBP”) and non-SHBP employees differently. 

The Law amends the SHBP for employees of the State, independent authorities, commissions, corporations or organizations, and addresses those employees who are not within a collective negotiations unit.  Specifically, in relation to SHBP employees, the Law provides, the amount of the contribution required by employees for whom there is no majority representative for collective negotiations purposes shall be determined in a manner consistent with the terms, if any, concerning health benefits coverage which are in a collective negotiations agreement deemed applicable to the employee.  

In other words, the Law indicates that the contribution of non-unionized employees of the State, independent authorities, etc., who are participating in SHBP “shall be determined in a manner consistent with the terms, if any, concerning health benefits coverage which are in a collective negotiations agreement deemed applicable” to the employee. 

That section, however, only applies to SHBP-participating employers.  The section of the Law which addresses municipalities and boards of education omits the above language referencing a collective negotiations agreement. Thus, generally, if an employee is not a member of a union, nor a participant in SHBP, he/she must begin making the 1.5% contribution on May 21, 2010. 

Complicating this issue, on April 20, 2010, the Pensions released a publication to assist employers in understanding the changes to public employee health benefits which provided, in pertinent part: 
<ul><ul>
Employees with no labor affiliation should begin the 1.5% contribution when the labor organization they are most closely aligned begins paying the contribution... Where there is no clear relationship between the non-aligned employee and a labor organization, the non-aligned employee should begin paying the 1.5% minimum contribution in the first full payroll cycle after May 21st (emphasis added).  
</ul></ul>
Subsequently, however, on April 28, 2010, the Division issued a revised copy of this publication. Most notably, the Division omitted the above language providing that non-aligned employees begin paying the mandatory contribution when the labor organization with which they are most “closely aligned” begins paying the contribution. In its place, Pensions failed to provide any guidance on when the mandatory contribution is to be applied to non-aligned employees. 

On May 18, 2010, LGS also issued Local Finance Notice 2010-18 (“LFN”), which also addresses the issue of non-aligned employees. The LFN indicates that those employees with individual employment agreements should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement are incorporated into the individual employment contract. If so, according to the LFN, these employees would be considered aligned and would not begin contributing until expiration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The LFN also provides that, if an individual employment agreement does not incorporate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, that contract should be reviewed under the Constitutional principle that a state may not pass any law impairing a contract.  Nonetheless, the FLN reiterated the proposition that non-aligned employees without an individual employment contract must begin contributing 1.5% on May 21, 2010.  

Thus, unless subject to an exception, all employees must contribute 1.5% of their base salary towards the cost of healthcare, effective May 21, 2010.  The exceptions to this general rule are: 
<ul>
<li>Employees covered by an applicable collective negotiations agreement, in effect on May 21, 2010.</li>
<br>
<li>Employees who waive health coverage.</li>
<br>
<li>Non-aligned employees with an individual employment contract which incorporates the terms and conditions of health coverage provided by a collective negotiations agreement.</li>

3876,"NJDEP Issues Invoices for Oversight Services","A recent audit conducted by the New Jersey State Legislature’s Office of Legislative Services revealed that over the past ten years, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) failed to issue invoices to a large number of parties for oversight services rendered. NJDEP estimates that about 4,000 sites were never (or partially) billed. The Department began sending invoices for previously unbilled oversight services in December 2006 and will continue issuing bills until all entities identified in the audit have been contacted. The Department is seeking to collect roughly $15 million in fees and has instituted a new billing and collections systems to help in this endeavor. More information can be found on the NJDEP’s website at <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/directbilling"">http://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/directbilling</a>.

NJDEP will now be withholding No Further Action<sup>1</sup> (NFA) letters from parties who have outstanding balances. The Department will also begin charging interest on unpaid oversight bills, which will dramatically increase the indirect cost rate they are charging parties responsible for site contamination<sup>2</sup>. Homeowners and innocent purchasers will continue to be exempt from paying the indirect cost rate under the new system.

If you received oversight services in the past and have not yet been charged, you should expect to receive a bill in the near future.

3880,"Scarinci Hollenbeck Successful for Jersey City Board of Education","In an opinion that was approved for publication on May 12, 2011, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court agreed with the arguments advanced by Scarinci Hollenbeck on behalf of its client, the Jersey City Board of Education. The magnitude of this decision is significant because it will impact not only Jersey City, but other school districts in the State as well.

In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Headen v. Jersey City Board of Education</span>, the issue presented on appeal was whether school districts that have adopted the New Jersey Civil Service Act should be required to extend vacation leave to the district's 10-month food service employees. The Plaintiff, Patricia Headen, argued she was entitled to additional vacation leave because she fell within the parameters of the statute governing vacation leave for ""full-time political sub-division"" civil servant employees. Scarinci Hollenbeck argued that the statute does not apply to 10-month school district employees and that instead the Plaintiff's employment is governed by Title 18A (statutes regarding the administration and operation of New Jersey's public school systems). Further, Scarinci Hollenbeck argued that the term ""political subdivision"" was intended by the Legislature to be distinct from ""school district.""

The Appellate Division agreed with the position argued by Scarinci Hollenbeck. The Appellate Division concluded that the statute addressed to full-time state and political subdivision employees was not intended to include local school district employees whose employment is subject to the provisions of Title 18A, and whose leave is defined by the terms of the applicable collectively negotiated agreements. There was no legislative intent to include 10-month school district employees within the scope of coverage of the New Jersey Civil Service Act. If the Legislature intended to apply a provision for vacation leave to a school district, it could have included such a reference. Further, the Appellate Division deferred to local negotiations, i.e., longstanding practice to include time off from work for public school employees through built-in school breaks.

3883,"Are Sales Taxes non-dischargeable in Bankruptcy?","Bankruptcy Code §523 declares certain tax claims to be non-dischargeable. ""Non-dischargeability"" is a big deal. Non-dischargeable claims do not get erased by bankruptcy. Indeed, no subsequent bankruptcy can ever erase them. In other words, like certain loathsome diseases, you live with them forever. The tax claims covered by Code §523 include (1) any tax, incurred at any time, if ""required to be collected or withheld,"" and (2) excise taxes accruing within the three years before bankruptcy.

The recent case of State of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">N.J. Div. of Taxation v. Michael Calabrese (In re Michael Calabrese)</span>, ___ B.R. ___ (D.N.J. 2011), makes clear that state sales taxes --accruing at any time before bankruptcy -- fall into the category of loathsome disease. Business owners are therefore well-advised to ensure that they promptly and fully pay their sales taxes to the state. The consequences of failing to do so are permanent.

In the case, Michael Calabrese ran a bagel business, which unfortunately foundered. He was then forced into personal bankruptcy. New Jersey filed a claim for sales taxes that were collected from the business customers but never paid over to the State. However, these taxes had accrued more than three years before Calabrese's bankruptcy, and he accordingly argued that they were ""excise taxes"" and, therefore, dischargeable as being beyond the three year window. The State argued that the taxes were ""required to be collected or withheld"" and therefore not subject to the three year limitation.

The court ruled for the State. It noted that no case law existed in New Jersey, and it therefore relied on decisions from the Second Circuit, in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">In re DeChiaro</span>, 760 F.2d 432 (2nd Cir. 1985), and the Ninth Circuit in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">In re Shank</span>, 792 F.2d 829, 832 (9th Cir. 1986), both of which supported New Jersey's position. The court also looked to the policies behind the statute, finding that the purpose of collecting sales tax from customers at the time of sale is to ensure payment of such taxes to the State. Thus, the court held, a sales tax collected by a third party and owed to the State ""is a tax clearly held in trust"" and therefore non-dischargeable.

As noted above, business owners are well-advised to pay sales taxes promptly and fully. There are many valuable and acceptable ways to finance a business. Using your sales tax collections is not one of them.",,20110422,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/are-sales-taxes-non-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates",,publish,5,are-sales-taxes-non-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy,,,0,0,open,closed
3886,"Foreclosing an Assigned Mortgage","A recent New Jersey Appellate Division ruling has placed a further burden on the foreclosure of real estate mortgages. The court vacated a foreclosure judgment and sheriff's sale, because the mortgage holder - an assignee of the original mortgagee -- filed foreclosure <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">before</span> being assigned the note and mortgage, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">even though</span> the mortgage holder later amended its complaint to allege receipt of the assignment. In essence, the court said that the bank should have waited to file suit until after the assignment was made, and that this default could not be cured simply by updating the original complaint. This creates one more procedural hurdle that a foreclosing bank must clear.

In the case, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. Mitchell</span>, No. A-4925-09T3 (App. Div. Aug. 9, 2011), the bank filed foreclosure on May 13, 2008. Only on May 14 were the note and mortgage assigned to Deutsche Bank. However, on June 2, the bank filed an amended foreclosure complaint, describing the assignment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the bank, finding it cured its standing defect by amending the complaint. With no request by debtor for a stay, the property proceeded to sheriff's sale, and Deutsche Bank successfully bid its lien.

The appellate court refused to dismiss the appeal as moot, due to the ""significant issues of public import"" raised by the question of standing. It then held as follows:
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>Because Deutsche Bank has not demonstrated that it possessed the note at the time it filed the original complaint, it has not established standing . . . Deutsche Bank must prove it had possession of the note when it filed the complaint to obtain standing.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
Deutsche Bank could not cure the defect in the initial complaint, filed one day before obtaining the assignment, by filing an amended complaint following the assignment.

The court then overturned the foreclosure judgment and the sheriff's sale.

One final note of caution to foreclosing banks. The bank's proofs on its motion for judgment contained the usual attorney's certification, stating that he had reviewed the bank's computerized file, including the information about the assignment of the note and mortgage. The appellate court noted in dictum that this was legally insufficient, since the standing requirement needed to have been established by someone with personal knowledge.",,20110912,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/foreclosing-an-assigned-mortgage/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates",,publish,5,foreclosing-an-assigned-mortgage,,,0,0,open,closed
3889,"Landlord's Rent at Risk in Bankruptcy","Is a landlord's rent at risk of being ""clawed back"" in a tenant's bankruptcy? Unfortunately it is, but not to despair. A defense exists – the right to deduct subsequently accruing but unpaid rentals from the amount being ""clawed back."" To see this in operation, consider the following.

In its heyday, a retailer -- we'll call them Tony's Tee Shirts -- leased stores all over a major metropolitan area. Winding downwards to its bankruptcy filing, Tony's began using the stores for liquidation sales. It then decamped, often leaving the last months of rent unpaid. To add insult to injury, Tony's bankruptcy trustee later filed a number of law suits against - among others - its former landlords. These were ""preferential transfer"" suits, based on the Bankruptcy Code section which lets a bankrupt ""claw back"" payments made to creditors within the last ninety days before bankruptcy. In Tony's case, the trustee sought all rent paid within that ninety days.

We represented one of the landlords - a very unhappy landlord. However, we were able to come up with a complete defense to the complaint - using the so-called ""new value after"" defense allowed under the Bankruptcy Code. Here's how it worked in our client's case.

In mid-July of the year it filed bankruptcy, Tony's paid our client $37,000 in rent for May and June. Tony's then filed bankruptcy in September, thus placing the $37,000 squarely within the ninety day period. Tony's remained on our premises until October 30th, conducting a ""going-out-of-business"" sale, thus benefitting from the use of the leased premises. It never paid the rent for July, August, and September.

The Bankruptcy Code provides several defenses to preferential transfers. One is ""new value after."" This holds that a preferential transfer must be reduced to the extent that, after the transfer, the defendant provided ""new value"" to the debtor. We therefore asserted that the unpaid rental value of our client's premises, accruing after the preferential transfers, was such ""new value"" and needed to be deducted. [In fact, it completely zeroed out the alleged preferences.]

The lead case for our position is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Southern Tech. College v. Hood</span>, 89 F.3d 1381, 1385 (8th Cir. Ark. 1996), where the court stated that ""[debtor] may not avoid the preferential transfer to the extent that the new value -- nearly two rent-free months -- remains unpaid for and unsecured."" And see <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ross v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. (In re Ross)</span>, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 2352, *15 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. June 10, 1997)(""[T]he continued use and occupancy of the dwelling unit . . . is thus new value to be set off against the debtor's recovery of the preference."").

The trustee's response was to agree to dismissal. Case closed. One happy landlord.",,20111107,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/landlords-rent-at-risk-in-bankruptcy/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates",,publish,5,landlords-rent-at-risk-in-bankruptcy,,,0,0,open,closed
3891,"Velocity Express Begins to Sue Customers","One of the more problematic aspects of business bankruptcy is the institution of the ""preferential transfer"" or the ""preference"" suit. In essence, section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code makes it actionable for a creditor to (i) receive payment, (ii) on an old debt, (iii) within 90 days before the customer files bankruptcy. All creditors are at risk of preference suits - inventory suppliers, landlords, and even its lawyers and accountants - as long as they get paid within that 90 day window.

However, what should be of greatest concern to potential defendants is the way that the ""mechanics"" of bankruptcy court work. To put it mildly, there is an aspect of ""litigation by ambush"" to the process. First of all, service of process in bankruptcy court is made by regular mail. A process server or sheriff is not needed. Thus, the summons and complaint may sit in your mail room for a while before their importance is recognized. Second, the answer to the complaint is due within 30 days of issuance of the summons and not within 30 days of service. This then all too often means that you are at or close to the date of defaulting before bringing in counsel. .

With that in mind, please be advised that a new series of bankruptcy preference cases is being filed -- in Delaware bankruptcy court in the Velocity Express matter. These will affect a nationwide class of defendants, and you should check in with your staff about the situation, in order to ascertain if you are at risk.

Here's the ""skinny"". In 1999, United Shipping &amp; Technology began operating as Velocity Express. At its height, Velocity employed 1,300 employees and 2,400 drivers. It was a package deliverer, providing customer bulk shipment, pick-up, and delivery services. In September 2009, Velocity filed bankruptcy. Ultimately, it sold its assets to an affiliate of Convest Investment Partners and began winding down. The court-appointed ""Wind Down Professional"" has now begun filing preference actions against persons who received payments in the last 90 days before bankruptcy.

3894,"Lenders Beware: Avoid Use of Trade Names in Financing Statements","A recent federal court appellate ruling has stripped a bank of its liens, even though the bank properly listed its borrower's full corporate name in the UCC-1 financing statement. The problem was that the bank also included the borrower's <u>trade name</u> in the same box.

In <u>Hastings State Bank v. Stalnaker (In re EDM Corp.)/<u>, borrower was incorporated as ""EDM Corporation"" and commonly known as ""EDM Equipment."" Bank #1 gave EDM a loan and filed a UCC-1 financing statement under ""EDM Corporation d/b/a EDM Equipment."" .

Bank #2 then extended credit to EDM, having first run a UCC search which did not reveal Bank #1's financing statement. The standard search logic used by the Secretary of State's office did not identify ""EDM Corporation d/b/a EDM Equipment"" as being the same entity as ""EDM Corporation.""

Under revised Article 9, UCC-1 financing statement data is entered and indexed based on the exact name listed in the financing statement box for the borrower's name. Article 9-503 further requires that the borrower's name in the UCC-1 be exactly as listed in the public records of the borrower's place of organization. The court interpreted this to mean that trade or other names may be added to the UCC-1 box for other or additional names <u>but not used in the box requiring the borrower's name</u>.

In the <u>EDM</u> case, Bank #1's UCC-1 had added such superfluous information to the name box. The court therefore held Bank #1's lien improperly perfected. Bank #2's lien was accordingly given first priority in the collateral.

Perfecting liens under Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code can be a minefield.

3896,"Licensed Site Professional (LSP) Bill May Change the Relationship Between Remediating Parties and Their Environmental Consultants, Increase Site Remediation Costs and Impose Mandatory Deadline for Site Remediation","<strong>By <a href=""/attorneys/partners/john-m-scagnelli/"" title=""John M. Scagnelli"">John M. Scagnelli</a></strong> | The Licensed Site Professional (LSP) Bill, Senate Bill No. 1897, originally sponsored by Senator Bob Smith, Chairman of the State Senate Environment Committee and revised by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”), has been designed to eliminate the backlog of contaminated site remediations undergoing review by NJDEP and to expedite the cleanup of contaminated sites through the creation of a Licensed Site Professional Program for environmental consultants working in New Jersey.

LSPs would be licensed by a newly established LSP Board, in, but not of, NJDEP, and would be authorized to undertake the remediation of New Jersey contaminated sites and issue certificates of completion of remediation called “response action outcomes.” NJDEP will retain oversight authority over the LSPs and, in certain cases, directly oversee site remediation work, such as in cases where responsible parties have a history of environmental noncompliance; fail to meet mandatory remediation timeframes; and where sites contain chromium waste, contribute to surface water sediment contamination by PCBs, mercury, and dioxin or are NJDEP high priority sites.

While the objectives of the LSP Bill are sound – expediting site cleanups by outsourcing to LSPs the responsibility for conducting site remediations and approving their completion, and in the process reducing the NJDEP staff burden and case processing delays – the latest February 13, 2009 draft LSP Bill contains provisions which go beyond these objectives. The draft LSP Bill, in its current form, contains provisions which may present significant problems for remediating parties. These provisions include those which may change the relationship between remediating parties and their environmental consultants, increase site remediation costs, and impose mandatory deadlines for site remediation.

These potentially problematic provisions in the February 13, 2009 draft need to be understood and considered by remediating parties, including site owners and operators, prospective purchasers, and others considering acquiring title to contaminated sites. Some of these provisions in the current draft LSP Bill are discussed below.
<strong>
The LSP Bill May Change the Relationship Between the LSP and the Client: Will the LSP Be More Representative of NJDEP or the Client?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Persons initiating the remediation of a contaminated site must hire LSPs to perform the remediation. There is a 3 year phase-in period for site remediations which are initiated prior to the enactment of the LSP Bill. Sections 30.b, c. Under the LSP Bill, the LSP’s highest priority is protection of public health and safety and the environment. The LSP must notify NJDEP within fifteen days after being hired by a client. The LSP is required to correct any deficiency NJDEP identifies in a document submitted concerning a remediation, and must correct the deficiency within timeframes established by the Department. Section 16.e. No provision is made in the LSP Bill to take into account reasonable questions or disputes regarding NJDEP’s deficiency directives or correction timeframes. It is thus unclear concerning how the LSP Bill affects current Department procedures in administering and implementing the Department’s Grace Period Rule and Technical Review Panel Procedure.</li>
<br>
<li>An LSP who takes responsibility for a site remediation from another LSP must correct all deficiencies raised by the Department relating to documents submitted to the Department by the previous LSP and correct the deficiencies within the Department’s timeframes. Section 16.g.</li>
<br>
<li>The LSP is required to disclose in any document he submits to the Department any facts, data, information and limitations he knows are not supportive of his own conclusions he reaches in his own submitted document. Section 16.i. The LSP is required, upon learning of a discharge (except related to historic fill) or an immediate environmental concern condition, to immediately notify the Department’s environmental hotline. Sections 16.j, k. The LSP Bill further requires that the LSP, upon learning of a client action or decision that results in a “deviation” from the LSP’s remedial action workplan or other remediation report, notify the Department, in writing, of his client’s “deviation.” “Deviation” is not defined in the LSP Bill. Section 16.l.</li>
</ul>
These sections in the LSP Bill require the LSP to report on his own client, include facts, data, information and limitations not supportive of the conclusions the LSP reaches, and undertake other actions under penalty of license revocation, administrative orders and penalty enforcement proceedings as provided in the Bill. These sections appear to supersede avenues currently available to a client to challenge the Department’s technical decisions and remediation timeframes. With these requirements, the LSP Bill appears to make the LSP more a representative of the Department than of his client.

Perhaps acknowledging this substantial change in the role of the LSP, the Bill contains a section which states that the LSP shall not state or imply, as an inducement or threat to a client or prospective client, an ability to improperly influence a government agency or official. Section 16.u.

The LSP Bill also requires the LSP to follow technical requirements and standards which may cause the LSP to conduct more extensive, and costly, remedial investigations and remedial actions than those currently required.
<ul>
<li>The LSP Bill requires that LSP technical remediation decisions be based upon more extensive standards than those required by Department’s Technical Standards for Site Remediation. These broader requirements include new Department adopted mandatory remediation timeframes and presumptive remedies, any available and appropriate Department site remediation technical guidelines, relevant USEPA or other state technical guidances, and “other relevant, applicable and appropriate methods and practices that insure the protection of the public health, safety and of the environment.” Section 14.b., c. Given these broader requirements, LSPs are likely to conduct more extensive, and costly, remedial investigations and remedial actions than those currently required, under fear of license revocation, administrative orders and penalty enforcement proceedings.</li>
<br>
<li>LSPs, in issuing certificates of completion of remediation, called response action outcomes, are required to provide their professional opinion that a contaminated site has been remediated so that it is “in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations protective of public health and safety and the environment.” Section 14d. As such, it seems entirely possible that LSPs may not issue certificates with this broad certification without conducting more extensive, and costly, remedial investigations and remedial actions than those currently required.</li>
</ul>
As noted above, LSPs are subject to significant penalties for violating LSP Bill requirements. LSPs violate the LSP Bill where they (i) know that their professional services constitute a violation of the Bill’s requirements, (ii) fail to take reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate the violation, and (iii) fail to provide required notifications to the LSP Board or the Department regarding violations, even after the LSP is fired by the client. Sections 15.r, w. The LSP Board has the authority to revoke or suspend an LSP’s license and initiate civil and administrative actions against the LSP, including actions for civil administrative penalties. In cases where an LSP purposely, knowingly or recklessly violates the LSP Bill, including making false statements, representations or certifications in Department filed applications or documents, the LSP can be found criminally liable for a crime of the third degree and subject to a fine of not less than $5,000 or no more than $75,000 per day of violation or by imprisonment, or both. Section 17.a. The LSP Bill attempts to protect the LSP from the client where issues arise between the LSP and client relating to the handling of a remediation project. The Bill contains a provision which prevents any person from taking “retaliatory action” against an LSP for actions the LSP takes under the Bill. Section 26. “Retaliatory action” is not defined in the Bill. Broadly construed, it seems possible that a client may find it prohibitive to replace their LSP and question LSP conclusions and judgments made in the remediation projects for which they are hired. This and other provisions of the LSP Bill may affect the client’s ability to hire and fire LSPs and question their judgments.

<strong>The LSP Bill May Increase Site Remediation Costs and Impose Mandatory Deadlines for Site Remediations.</strong>

The LSP Bill contains sections which may significantly increase the costs of site remedial investigations and remedial actions and result in the imposition of mandatory deadlines for site remediations. The following are some examples:
<ul>
<li>LSPs cannot be employed as in-house salaried employees of remediating parties. Section 16.y. Many site owners and/or operators currently employ in-house environmental consultants to reduce environmental costs. The LSP Bill requires remediating parties to hire outside LSPs.</li>
<br>
<li>The LSP Bill requires NJDEP to establish a permit program to regulate the operation, maintenance and inspection of engineering or institutional controls installed as part of a remedial action of a contaminated site. Section 19.a. Persons issued permits must maintain insurance, financial assurance or other financial guarantees to ensure funding is available to operate, maintain and inspect installed engineering controls. Section 19.c. Establishing an engineering and institutional control permitting program within the Department will require increased Department staffing in the Site Remediation Program and increase remedial costs for remediating parties.</li>
<br>
<li>The LSP Bill gives the Department authority to invalidate the LSP’s certificate of cleanup completion, known as a response action outcome, if the Department determines that the remedial action is not protective of public health, safety or the environment or if a presumptive remedy was not implemented as required. Section 22. This undermines the finality of LSP response action outcomes and may increase pressure upon the LSP to conduct more extensive, and costly, remedial investigations and remedial actions than those currently required.</li>
<br>
<li>The LSP Bill directs NJDEP to establish mandatory remediation timeframes and expedited site specific timeframes for (i) receptor evaluation, (ii) control of ongoing sources of contamination, (iii) establishment of interim remedial measures, (iv) addressing immediate environmental concern conditions, (v) performance of each phase of the remediation, including preliminary assessment, site investigation, remedial investigation and remedial action, (vi) completion of remediation, and (vii) any other activities deemed necessary to effectuate timely remediation. Section 28. Imposition of mandatory remediation timeframes will likely create issues on complex remediation sites, particularly brownfields sites.</li>
<br>
<li>In cases where the Department undertakes direct oversight of remediation of a contaminated site, the Department is given the authority to select the remedial action for the site. Section 27.c.</li>
<br>
<li>Remediation funding sources are now required for all site remediations. Section 30.b. This requirement applies to ISRA sites, Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) cases, underground storage tank (UST), and all other cases not subject to remediation funding source requirements under current NJDEP regulations.</li>
</ul>
These provisions of the current draft LSP Bill may change the relationship between remediating parties and their environmental consultants, increase site remediation costs and impose mandatory deadlines for site remediation. While the objectives of the draft LSP Bill are sound, these and similar provisions in the current draft LSP may need to be rethought and revised. As written, the provisions may create serious and substantial difficulties for remediating parties, including site owners and operators, prospective purchasers and others acquiring title to contaminated sites.

3899,"Careful Planning Can Maximize Benefits of Energy Efficiency and Solar Energy Investments","<strong>By William C. Sullivan, Jr. and Patrick J. McNamara</strong> | Representatives of commercial property owners and public entities throughout New Jersey are increasingly being asked to evaluate the financial risks and rewards of an investment in energy efficiency and solar energy investments

A careful evaluation of such an investment involves many legal and financial issues that must be considered. Specifically, state and federal statutes create a number of financial incentives for such projects. New Jersey's Solar Energy Advancement and Fair Competition Act requires utilities to ensure that certain percentages of the power they sell comes from renewable energy sources. One way the utility companies can satisfy this requirement is to purchase Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (""SRECs"") from businesses, public entities or individuals that generate energy from their own solar power systems. Each 1000 kilowatt-hours of energy produced generates one SREC for the owner of the system. Currently, SRECs are being traded at more than $600 each.

Federal tax incentives have greatly increased the economic attractiveness of these systems. Owners of systems qualify for a federal grant of 30% of the eligible cost basis of the system and accelerated depreciation.

Interested parties have developed a variety of options to make the investment in solar energy worthwhile. For owner-occupied buildings, the owner can purchase, own and maintain the system. Under a typical scenario, the owner then gets the tax grant, the accelerated depreciation, the revenue from the SRECs, the reduced cost of electricity, and any other applicable incentives. Where the property owner does not want to be responsible for the system and/or where the energy is being used by a third party tenant, the most common device being used is a Power Purchase Agreement (""PPA""). In a PPA, a solar vendor installs and owns the system and sells the energy to the tenant. The vendor gets the federal grant, accelerated depreciation, SREC revenue, and revenue from the energy sold to the tenant. Typically, the owner gets revenue from renting the roof space to the vendor while the tenant gets the benefit of reduced energy costs. Of course, the parties can and often do negotiate variations on these scenarios based on the property conditions and expectations of the parties.

These government programs and financial instruments can make the investment in solar energy attractive. However, any such project must be carefully analyzed in light of building conditions, on-site energy needs, the length of time remaining on current leases and other factors.

It is also critical to recognize how much energy efficiency improvements will contribute to the success of a solar investment. In some cases, federal tax incentives for more efficient lighting, HVAC upgrades and building envelope improvements may cover the cost of roof upgrades needed for a solar installation, for example, especially when combined with New Jersey incentives under the State's Clean Energy Program like Direct Install and Pay for Performance.

Property owners should carefully review the energy efficiency and solar programs, their criteria and potential benefits with qualified counsel and energy consultants before undertaking a solar or energy efficiency project.

3902,"MUNICIPAL BUDGET ALERT: Three Recently Enacted Laws that will Affect this Year's Municipal Budgets","Municipalities are facing tough economic decisions in establishing their Municipal Budget. The New Jersey Legislature enacted three new laws that affect a municipality's budgets and are as follows: Arbitration Reform Bill, Health Care Contribution Amendment and New Tax Cap Levy.

<strong>Arbitration Reform Bill</strong>

On January 1, 2011, the Arbitration Reform Bill became effective, which revised the procedure for police and fire contract disputes with public entities in binding arbitration and imposed a new ""cap"" on certain arbitration awards. This recently enacted bill sets new limits to the interest arbitration process, including a 2% cap on the increase of base salaries for collective bargaining agreements that have expired and entered the interest arbitration process after impasse for the next three (3) years. The Arbitration Reform Bill will take effect immediately, however, the 2% cap on base salary will only affect police and fire department contracts that expire between December 31, 2010 to April 1, 2014 and seek interest arbitration. Collective bargaining ­agreements that expired before December 30, 2010 and subsequently file for interest arbitration will be subject to all amendments except the 2% cap on base salary increases.

Some of the pertinent features of the Arbitration Reform Bill include:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Imposes a 2% cap on base salary increases for police and firefighter arbitration awards issued from January 1, 2011 to April 1, 2014; this law is effective on collective bargaining agreements that have expired from January 1, 2010 through April 1, 2014.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The 2% cap affects the ""Base Salary,"" which includes salary increments, longevity, length of service, and other similar compensation as provided in the collective bargaining agreement.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The parties may agree or the arbitrator may decide to distribute the aggregate monetary value of the award unequally over the term of the agreement.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Health care, pension costs and non-economic issues are exempt from the 2% cap.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Arbitrator's fee can not exceed $1,000 per day and the total cost of arbitration cannot exceed $7,500 per case.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Arbitrator cannot impose a fee of more than $500 for the cancellation of an arbitration proceeding without good cause.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong>Health Care Contributions</strong>

According to the new amendment of N.J.S.A. 40A:10-21(b), effective May 21, 2010, public employees will share the cost of health benefits with their public employer. Public employees will provide 1.5% of the employee's base salary to health care contributions. Specifically, the amendment of N.J.S.A. 40A:10-21(b) requires public employees of the State of New Jersey, municipalities, counties and local school boards to contribute a minimum of 1.5% of base salary toward their own health benefits. The health care contribution amendment is effective on May 21, 2010, or upon expiration of an ""applicable collective negotiations agreement.""

<strong>Tax Levy Cap of 2%</strong>

Recently, the Legislature amended N.J.S.A. 40A:4-45.45(b) effective July 10, 2010, which provides a 2% cap on the tax levy with certain exceptions, including healthcare and pensions. A municipality is limited to raising the tax levy 2% which restricts the amount that the Municipality can raise its overall budget. The Municipality may request approval, through a referendum to voters, to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than 2%.

3905,"New Jersey Employee Pension and Health Care Reform 2011","New Jersey Public Employees now have new rules regarding pension and health care benefits. Governor Chris Christie signed the law on June 28, 2011, and it affects the Teacher's Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), the Public Employee's Retirement System (PERS), the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), the State Police Retirement System (SPRS), and the Judicial Retirement System (JRS). Most significantly, the new bill requires employees to contribute more to their pension fund and health insurance. In addition, public employers are required to establish flexible spending arrangements for its employees.
<strong>
Increased Pension Contribution:</strong>
Public employees are now required to contribute more towards their pensions. Teacher and public employee pension contributions will be increased to 6.5% of their base salary and their contribution will gradually increase by .14% per year for the next seven (7) years until 7.5% is reached. Pension contributions for police and firefighters will be increased to 10% of their base salary. The increases must be implemented on or after October 1, 2011.
<strong>
New Age Retirement Requirements:</strong>
Retirement qualifications are also modified by the law. The retirement age for teachers and public workers is increased from 62 to 65 years of age. The new law also increased the penalty for early retirement of teachers and public employees to 3% of their pension per year. Police and firefighters are eligible for special retirement at age 65 with 30 years of service or age 60 with 25 years of service.

<strong>New Committees Formed:</strong>
The new law establishes new committees for the TPAF, SPRS, PERS and PFRS pension groups. Half of the committee members will be chosen by the governor and the remaining positions will be selected by union members. Once a target funded ratio is achieved for the system, the committees will have the authority to determine various factors affecting the pension systems including: member contribution rate; formula for calculation of final compensation or final salary; fraction used to calculate a retirement allowance; age at which a member may be eligible and the benefits for service or early retirement; and benefits provided for disability retirement.
<strong>
Increased Health Care Contributions:</strong>
All public employees will now contribute a percentage of their salaries towards their health care benefits as dictated by the new law. The new contribution for health benefits is effective immediately for employees whose current union contract has expired and employees not covered by a union contract. Employees currently under a union contract will not be impacted until after their contract expires. Employees will now be required to contribute to their health premiums in percentages that are based on their salary as set forth in the new law.

<strong>Flexible Spending Accounts:</strong>
All public employers must now establish a flexible spending arrangement that satisfies the requirements under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code for reimbursement of medical and dental plan costs.

3908,"Important Deadline Nears for Compliance with NJDEP Public Outreach and Notification Regulations","<strong>By <a title=""John M. Scagnelli"" href=""/attorneys/partners/john-m-scagnelli/"">John M. Scagnelli</a> and <a title=""William A. Baker"" href=""/attorneys/counsel/william-a-baker/"">William A. Baker</a></strong> | September 2, 2009 is an important date for all persons responsible for conducting New Jersey environmental remediations initiated prior to September 2, 2008.

September 2, 2009 is the deadline for compliance with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s (NJDEP) Public Outreach and Notification Regulations (“Regulations”), which apply to all New Jersey environmental remediation sites. All persons responsible for conducting New Jersey remediations initiated prior to September 2, 2008 must be in compliance by this date or potentially face penalties. Failure to comply with the Regulations could carry penalties of up to $8,000 per day. N.J.A.C. 7:26C-10.4.
<strong>
Compliance Obligations - Public Notification</strong>

For sites where remediation began after the September 2, 2008 effective date of the Regulations, public notification, either by posted signs or letters, must be made not later than two weeks prior to either initiating field activities associated with a remedial investigation or a multi-phase remediation, or initiating a single phase remediation. For those sites where remediation was initiated prior to the September 2, 2008 effective date of the Regulations, compliance with the Regulations must occur by September 2, 2009<sup id=""one"">1</sup>. N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4(h), (i).

The person responsible for conducting the remediation must either post a sign of at least two feet by three feet in size with specified wording at the remediation site or send notification letters with specified content to owners and tenants of real property, and to administrators of school and child care facilities, located within 200 feet of the site.

If a language other than English is predominantly spoken by property owners and tenants in the area within 200 feet of the site, the sign or notice letter must be in the non-English language. If notice letters are sent, new update letters must be sent every two years until a No Further Action Letter is issued by NJDEP for the site. N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4(h), (i).

<strong>Compliance Obligations - Identification of Sensitive Populations and Resources</strong>

As part of the required public notice (regardless of whether notice is given by posting a sign or sending a notice letter), the person responsible for conducting the remediation must identify sensitive populations and resources located within 200 feet of the site, including residences, potable wells, schools, child care facilities, public parks and playgrounds, surface water and Tier I wellhead protection areas. This information must be submitted to the NJDEP case manager, the NJDEP Office of Community Relations, and the municipal clerk and designated local health official of the municipality where the site is located not later than two weeks prior to initiating field work associated with the remedial investigation, or by September 2, 2009 for sites where remediation was initiated prior to September 2, 2008. N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4(f).

<strong>Compliance Obligations - Fact Sheet Publication</strong>

If contamination has migrated off-site in any environmental medium, a fact sheet with specified content must be prepared and distributed by the party responsible for conducting the remediation. The fact sheet must contain certain specified information concerning the site, including the site history and a description of contamination on the site. The fact sheet must be distributed to owners and tenants of real property located within 200 feet of the site within two weeks after a determination is made that contamination has migrated off the site, or by not later than September 2, 2009 for sites where contamination migrated off site prior to September 2, 2008. Within four weeks of the discovery of off-site contamination, the person responsible for conducting the remediation must publish the fact sheet as a display advertisement in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the site and sent a copy to the NJDEP case manager, the NJDEP Office of Community Relations, and the municipal clerk and designated health official of the municipality where the site is located. N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4(k).

<strong>Compliance Obligations - Additional Public Outreach</strong>

NJDEP is permitted to require that additional public outreach be conducted for certain sites if it determines that additional outreach is needed due to site-specific circumstances or if it determines that there is substantial public interest in remediation activities concerning a site. These public outreach measures may include, but are not limited to, hosting a public information session or public meeting, publishing a notice with information about the site in a local paper of record, or establishing a local information repository. N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4(o).

<strong>Summary</strong>

The Regulations were designed to enhance public notification of remediation activities on contaminated sites and to provide local municipalities and affected communities with notice and opportunity to have input in the site remediation process. These requirements, however, create yet another layer of compliance obligations for persons responsible for conducting site remediations which need to be considered and dealt with at all New Jersey environmental remediation sites. It is important that all persons responsible for conducting New Jersey environmental site remediations understand and comply with NJDEP’s Public Outreach and Notification Regulations.

3911,"Pending Bills in the New Jersey Legislature Establish NJDEP Licensed Site Professional Program","<strong>By <a href=""/attorneys/partners/john-m-scagnelli/"" title=""John M. Scagnelli"">John M. Scagnelli</a> </strong>| New Jersey State Senator Bob Smith and Assemblyman John F. McKeon have introduced S-1897/A-2962 which establish a licensed site professional program in the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and make important changes to NJDEP’s Site Remediation Programs. The changes to NJDEP’s programs made by S-1897/A-2962 significantly change the way of doing business with NJDEP and deserve attention.

<strong>NJDEP Licensed Site Professional Program</strong>

Licensed Site Professionals (LSPs) once licensed by NJDEP, will certify that remediation at contaminated sites has been performed in conformance with NJDEP’s technical requirements. Until the LSP program can get off the ground<sup>1</sup>, LSPs will be issued interim licenses by NJDEP based on experience<sup>2</sup>. The following are key components of the NJDEP LSP Program:
<ul>
<li>Criteria are established for a Tier 1 to Tier 4 ranking system for contaminated sites.</li>
<br>
<li>NJDEP will select the remedy for Tier 1 sites, review and approve all documents submitted for Tier 2 sites, and review screening documents, certifications, and checklists for Tier 3 and Tier 4 sites. NJDEP can audit remediations at Tier 3 and Tier 4 sites.</li>
<br>
<li>Most documents relating to the remediation of Tier 1 to Tier 4 sites must be signed and certified by an LSP, or by a certified subsurface evaluator<sup>3</sup>. Responsible parties who employ persons not LSPs for remediation projects are subject to penalties.</li>
<br>
<li>NJDEP can issue interim LSP licenses which will remain effective until 180 days after NJDEP’s adoption of rules establishing permanent LSP requirements.</li>
<br>
<li>NJDEP will issue certificates of authorization to firms providing remediation services and no firm can provide licensed site professional services in the state without the authorization.</li>
<br>
<li>A code of professional conduct for LSPs and subsurface evaluators will be established with provisions for license suspension and revocation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes to NJDEP’s Site Remediation Programs</strong>
<ul>
<li>NJDEP will impose a 5% surcharge on the actual cost of a limited restricted use or restricted use remedial actions with the surcharges deposited in a new Remediation Guarantee Fund created in NJDEP. Moneys in the Fund will be used by NJDEP to pay for remediation where the person fails to conduct or properly conduct the remediation.</li>
<br>
<li>NJDEP will establish mandatory time frames for the conduct of remediations at contaminated sites.</li>
<br>
<li>Any person voluntarily conducting remediation at a contaminated site (NJDEP’s MOA Program) must establish and maintain a remediation funding source in the amount of the estimated cost of remediation.</li>
<br>
<li>Person(s) responsible for conducting remediation at the site of an unregulated heating oil tank, a childcare facility, an educational facility, or at Tier 4 sites are not required to establish a remediation funding source.</li>
<br>
<li>Upon submission of a remedial action workplan which proposes implementing a limited restricted use or restricted use remedial action, the person responsible for performing the remediation must annually estimate the costs of remediation for 20 years after the approval of the remedial action workplan, including costs of operation, monitoring and maintenance of the remedial action and include those costs in the remediation funding source.</li>

3917,"President Obama Signs Workplace-Related Legislation","By <strong><a title=""Christina M. Michelson"" href=""/attorneys/associates/christina-m-michelson/"">Christina M. Michelson</a></strong> | <strong>NEW AMENDMENTS TO COBRA</strong>

Employers that provide a group health insurance plan to their employees must take note of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that was signed into law on February 19, 2009. The new legislation provides employers with a subsidy for the cost of COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) premiums for eligible former employees. Eligible employees are those that have been terminated or laid off on or after September 1, 2008 through December 21, 2009.

Under the new legislation, eligible employees will only be required to pay 35% of the COBRA premium. The remaining 65% will be reimbursed through a payroll tax credit to the employer. Employers will be responsible for providing coverage until reimbursement from the federal government. Subsidy coverage by the federal government began on March 1, 2009.

<strong>Employer Requirements under the New Law</strong>

Employers are required to provide written notification regarding the new federal subsidy to all individuals that were involuntarily terminated as of September 1, 2008 and must provide written notification to the individuals by April 18, 2009. Details of the new notice requirements and flyers can be found at <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/COBRA"">www.dol.gov/COBRA</a>.

<strong>Subsidy Reimbursement</strong>

The new legislation provides employers with a subsidy for the cost of COBRA premiums for eligible former employees. Employers are reimbursed through the federal quarterly payroll tax reporting system. Employers are required to advance the premium subsidies until the employer’s payments can be recouped through reduced federal tax payments. Payroll taxes will be offset by the amount of the premium paid for COBRA-eligible individuals, however, only after the COBRA-eligible individual has paid the 35% portion. Details on the new tax provisions can be found at <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/COBRA"">www.dol.gov/COBRA</a>.
<strong>
EQUAL-PAY LEGISLATION</strong>

President Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and addresses salary bias in the workplace. Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Restoration Act essentially restarts the six-month statute of limitations every time a worker receives a paycheck. Additionally, this Act applies retroactively to May 28, 2007 and expands the definition of unlawful pay practices as well as broadens the scope of persons who may file claims.

The Act was named for an Alabama woman who at the end of a 19-year career as a supervisor at a tire factory complained that she had been paid less than men. Ms. Ledbetter, prior to retiring, discovered that the men in her plant doing similar work were paid 15 to 40 percent more than she was paid. This new legislation will almost certainly lead to more lawsuits being filed and increased wage discrimination litigation based not only on age, but on all of the protected classifications. There are measures, however, that employers can take to decrease liability.

3926,"Public Agencies Required to Charge ""Actual Costs"" for Copies of Records","<strong>By <a title=""Sheri K. Siegelbaum"" href=""/attorneys/counsel/sheri-k-siegelbaum/"">Sheri K. Siegelbaum </a></strong>| Public entities subject to the Open Public Records Act (“OPRA”) must, as of July 1, 2010, charge “actual cost” for making copies that are from OPRA requests. The Appellate Division decision, in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Dean Smith v. Hudson County Register, et al.</span>, A-1762-08T2 (February 10, 2010), is effective July 1, 2010.

Until this decision, many public entities charged the default schedule of fees set forth in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(b). That schedule provides for costs of $.75 per page for pages 1-10, $.50 per page for pages 11-20, and $.25 per page for all pages over 20. The Court in Dean Smith held that this fee schedule is only a “not to exceed” schedule for the cost copies and that actual cost must be used.

In light of the Court’s decision, all public entities should establish an “actual cost” for making copies. If the entity is a municipality, it should consider adopting an ordinance prior to July 1, 2010 to establish these fees.

Although the Court did not specifically say what costs of making copies should be included in a determination of “actual cost,” it did indicate that labor and overhead costs are not to be included. Generally, items to be considered in “cost” include:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Paper</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Toner or ink</li>
	<li>Cost of acquiring the copier (lease or purchase amortized)</li>
	<li>Maintenance contract (amortized)</li>
	<li>Repairs not covered by the maintenance contract (amortized) and</li>
	<li>Electricity used by the copying process (as long as it can be calculated and amortized).</li>
</ol>
Since all different copiers used by a public entity may have a “different” cost of making a copy, the Court did suggest that an average cost of all of the different copier costs can be used. Also, this cost should be recalculated and updated yearly so that the “actual cost” remains current.

3928,"Governor Signs Bill Enacting Paid Leave Law","<strong>By Bruce W. Padula</strong> | New Jersey now follows California and Washington to become the third state to require employers to offer paid leave to employees wishing to care for a new child or sick relative. The new law will allow up to six weeks of paid leave during any twelve month period in the form of state temporary disability insurance benefits.

<strong>Eligibility</strong>

Employees eligible for the paid leave are those who are covered under the state unemployment compensation law (full-time employees employed at least twenty weeks and employees who have been out of such covered employment less than two weeks). The law allows an eligible employee to take paid leave any time in the first year after a child’s birth or adoption or to take paid leave to care for a sick relative (child, spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner or parent) who is receiving inpatient care in a medical facility or under continuing supervision from a health care provider. In addition, the law covers all employers subject to the New Jersey unemployment compensation law, regardless of the number of employees they employ.

<strong>Benefits Under the Law</strong>

The benefit will be funded by worker contributions of an estimated $33 per year through a mandatory employee payroll tax, not by the employer directly. Employees who opt to take the paid leave would receive two-thirds of their salary, to a maximum of $524 per week. Further, under the new law, employers can require the employee to take up to two weeks of available sick or vacation pay before receiving benefits.

<strong>Potential Burden to Employers</strong>

Although the employer is not directly responsible for paying an employee on leave, there still may be underlying burdens placed on employers. For example, the law provides for numerous notice obligations, such as providing all employees with a notice of benefit rights. The employer is required to adequately assess the circumstances that might fall under this new law to determine if the employee is eligible for the paid leave, which may increase administrative costs. The State has estimated that 38,000 employees annually would take the paid leave and this alone can create hardships for employers who may need to hire additional employees or pay overtime pay to employees covering the duties of the employees on leave.
<strong>
FMLA and NJFLA</strong>

The Legislature, in drafting this bill, did take into account the federal and state laws already in place to provide leave possibilities to employees. As such, this law requires employees to take paid leave concurrently with any leave under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) and the New Jersey Family Leave Act (“NJFLA”). Unlike the FMLA and the NJFLA, however, the paid leave law does not require the employer to return the employee to the same or equivalent position at the end of the leave. If it is found that the paid leave also qualifies under FMLA or NJFLA and the employee has a guarantee that they will retain their position or its equivalent under the already established leave provisions, then the new law would not affect any rights the employee is entitled to under the FMLA and NJFLA.

<strong>Effective Date</strong>

The law will take effect on January 1, 2009 and payments will become available starting on July 1, 2009. There are many intricacies and exemptions to the new law that will affect each entity differently based on entity type. Entities should consider reviewing the new law with their attorneys to determine how they will be affected.

Brunetti</a></strong> | One of the biggest advantages to incorporating a business is liability protection. Forming a corporation, limited liability or similar entity forms what is called a “corporate veil,” a division between an entity and the personal assets of the shareholders of a corporation. If challenged in a lawsuit, IRS audit or other action, the veil of liability protection may be pierced and the shareholders may be held liable for the debts and/or liabilities of the corporation if it is found that the corporation did not follow proper corporate formalities. <strong> Shareholder Protection</strong> A corporation and an LLC is a legal person or entity that exists separately from its shareholders. It may, therefore, contract or otherwise incur obligations apart from a shareholder. As a result, one desired aspect of a corporation is that shareholders (or in the case of an LLC, the members) are not individually liable for the debts or obligations of the entity. For purposes of our discussion, references herein to corporations will apply similarly to LLCs. In some circumstances, however, courts will ignore the corporate identity and hold the individual shareholders liable for the debts and obligations of that corporation by applying a legal theory that is commonly referred to as the “alter ego doctrine.” Under this theory, if a party whose interest has been injured due to the acts of a corporation can prove that the corporation entity is the “alter ego” of one or more individuals, the court may hold the individuals themselves personally responsible for the injurious conduct. Typically, an alter ego allegation is made against a corporation and its shareholders when the corporation’s assets or insurance are inadequate to respond to a claim or to pay a debt. A creditor who would otherwise go unpaid by the corporation will seek to hold its shareholders personally liable for the claim based on the theory that:</p><ul><ul><li>The shareholder has not treated the corporation as an entity separate and apart from themselves so why should the Court,</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When maintaining the corporate veil would be inequitable. Piercing the corporate veil has been granted in 40% of the cases where the issue was raised.</li></ul><p>Piercing initiated by the federal government is effective in almost 60% of the cases it has raised and more than 80% of the time when raised in a regulatory context or in environmental litigation and in fraud cases [R. Thompson, “Piercing the Corporate Veil: An Empirical Study,” 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1036, 1948-49 (1991)]. The equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil is applied in New Jersey in situations where the principal, i.e. owner, uses the corporation (or his LLC) as his “alter ego” and thus abuses the corporate form in order to advance his own personal interests. See Walensky v. Jonathan Royce International, Inc., 264 N.J. Super. 276 (App. Div. 1993). The two primary factors that weigh in favor of an “alter ego” finding are the use of the business as a personal business conduit and a lack of a separate corporate identity. Judge Stripp distinctly summarized the criteria for piercing the corporate veil under New Jersey common laws as follows:</p><ul><ul><li>A shareholder disregarded the corporate entity and made it into a mere instrumentality for their own affairs.</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><ul><li>There was such a unity of interest and ownership that the owners and the corporation have no separate existence; and</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Upholding the corporate veil would protect fraud or promote other injustice.</li></ul><p><strong>Piercing the Corporate Veil in Bankruptcy</strong> In Bankruptcy proceedings, the court uses a concept called “substantive consolidation” to in effect pierce the veil. This doctrine permits the bankruptcy court to pool all of the debtor’s assets as well as the assets of affiliated entities owned by the debtor, in order to satisfy claims against the debtor. Substantive consolidation will be allowed when:</p><ul><ul><li>The creditor dealt with the entities as a whole, and not as separate entities, and</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The affairs of the debtor are so intertwined that the consolidation would benefit all of the creditors.</li></ul><p>A fruitful discussion of piercing the corporate veil in a bankruptcy case in New Jersey can be found in Buildings by Jamie, Inc., United States Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey, Case No. 96-39381. In Buildings by Jamie, Inc., the creditors of the bankrupt debtor sought to recover monies loaned to the debtor. The debtor was a close corporation which constructed homes for sale to third parties. During a certain period of time preceding the bankruptcy, loans were made to the debtor for use exclusively in the construction of these homes. The debtor did not repay the loans. The creditors allege that the debtor transferred the net proceeds of sale of several homes to Jamie, Inc. (not the debtor) for no consideration, which in turn transferred $100,000 to the individual owners again for no consideration. The creditors further allege that the debtors transferred accounts receivables to a related corporation for no consideration. The creditors further argued that the individual debtors used the loan money from a guaranty for their personal benefit including construction of their personal residence and the purchase of real property and renovation of business property which was not owned by the debtor. Finally, the creditors alleged that in a series of transactions the debtor transferred all of its cash and several thousand dollars worth of assets to a related corporation for no consideration. During the period in question, the debtor ceased operations but the related corporations continued operations virtually indistinguishable from the debtor’s business. These corporations were operated from the same location, by the same employees, shared the same offices and had the same shareholder. The plaintiff sought to compel the debtor to repay the loan obligations and the transfers among debtor and non-debtor defendants. In doing so, they allege that the individual shareholders were liable for the debtor’s debts based upon an “alter ego theory.” The plaintiffs relied on lack of corporate formalities among the debtor and the non-debtor defendants as well as the free transferability of assets and share ownership, use of the same employees, same location and same line of business. The plaintiffs sought to pierce the corporate veil based upon the complete disregard of corporate formalities, free transfer of assets among the corporations and the shareholders and the interchangeable use of corporations. In reviewing New Jersey alter ego law, Judge Stripps sitting in the Bankruptcy Court reaffirmed the principal that it is well settled in New Jersey that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is employed when fraud or injustice has been perpetrated. The court stated that the principal (owner) could be held liable under theories of piercing the corporate veil and successor liability because the principal “was using the corporation as his “alter ego” and thus was abusing the corporate form in order to advance his own personal interest.” Factors which weighed heavily included the principal’s treatment of the corporation as a personal business conduit and that the corporation was a mere instrument through which the shareholder conducted their own affairs and furthermore the principal failed to maintain an identity separate and apart from the corporation. The court also noted that in New Jersey courts generally pierce the corporate veil where such unity of ownership exists where the corporation operates as an instrument of the shareholders’ personal business such that the failure to disregard the corporate entity would promote fraud. Finally, the court concluded that the bankruptcy trustee had the power to reach beyond the debtor corporation into the pockets of the corporation’s shareholders. <strong>How to Avoid Having the Corporate Veil Pierced</strong> Shareholders are not liable for corporate debts or lawsuit liability if the corporation is properly established and maintained. To help insure that creditors cannot pierce the corporate veil and seek judgments against the shareholders, corporate formalities must be observed, the corporation must be treated as an entity separate and apart from its shareholders. Make sure the corporation has done the following:</p><ul><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Documentation and Formalities</span>: Create By-Laws, issue stock, maintain an up to date corporate minute book (do not wait for the night before an audit to create them), have separate books of account, file annual reports, have regular board meetings with all directors.</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Avoid Co-mingling</span>: Do not co-mingle corporate assets with those of shareholders, all corporate assets should be titled in the corporate name. Corporations should have its own separate bank account. If you borrow from, or lend to the corporation, record an appropriate Resolution, sign a promissory note, charge fair market rate interest, make regular payments.</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Capitalization</span>: Appropriately capitalize the corporation and purchase appropriate liability insurance.</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Employment Agreements</span>: Enter into one between you and your corporation.</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Multiple Corporation</span>: Avoid identical stock ownership of several corporations. Avoid having similar officers and directors. Use different business addresses, telephone numbers and employees.</li></ul><p>In addition, the fact that a business is being operation as the corporation should be made evident. The words “inc.” or “incorporated” should be present on letterheads, business cards and corporate signs. Those who operate the entity should sign all contracts and documents in a corporate capacity indicating their corporate position. In these uncertain times, the valuable advice you give your clients can pay dividends. An important part of estate planning and wealth preservation is the protection of assets. Keeping corporate liabilities separate from shareholders is an important part of the asset protection plan. <span class=""subnews"">This Scarinci Hollenbeck Client Alert has been prepared for the general information of clients and friends of the firm.

3937,"Property Inherited in 2010: Carryover Basis Rules","<strong>By <a href=""/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/"" title=""Frank L. Brunetti"">Frank L. Brunetti</a></strong> | The federal estate tax has undergone several changes in recent years. We had an estate tax in 2009, and none in 2010. In December of 2010, Congress retroactively enacted an estate tax for 2010, but gave executors options to determine basis of assets inherited from a decedent.

In a legislative compromise at the end of 2010, the estate tax, which was put away with in the prior year, was revived and retroactively reinstated to apply to decedents who died in 2010. However, an important feature of the law that revived the estate tax is that it gives executors of estates of decedents who died in 2010 a choice. The executor can either:
<ul><ul>
(a) have the new estate tax rules ($5 million exemption, with a flat rate of 35% imposed on all transfers over that amount) apply to the estate, in which case the traditional stepped-up basis rules (which provide that the basis of assets received from a decedent is equal to the value of such assets on the date of the decedent's death) would apply in determining the basis of property acquired from the decedent; OR

(b) elect not to be subject to the estate tax, meaning that the estate would pass to the heirs free from estate tax, but the modified carryover basis rules (discussed below) would apply in determining the basis of property acquired from the decedent.
</ul></ul>
<strong>Modified Carryover Basis Rules</strong>

Under the modified carryover basis rules, the basis of property acquired from an individual dying in 2010, in the hands of the person acquiring it, generally is the lower of the fair market value on the date of the decedent's death or the adjusted basis of the property immediately before the death of the decedent.

For example, the decedent died on Jan. 1, 2010, owning 200 shares of Corporation Y stock having a fair market value of $40,000. His adjusted basis in the stock immediately before his death was $30,000, which was the amount he paid for the 200 shares several years ago. Absent from a permitted basis increase for the stock, the basis of the Corporation Y stock in the hands of the person acquiring it from the decedent is $30,000. Now, assume the stock is worth $20,000 on the date of decedent's death. Here, the basis in the hands of the person acquiring or receiving it is $20,000.

The basis of property determined under the general rule (i.e., the lesser of adjusted basis or fair market value) is increased by a general basis increase amount of $1.3 million. In other words, each estate receives a $1.3 million of basis plus more (depending on marital status at time of death and other circumstances) to be added to the carryover basis of any one or more of the assets held at death. However, no addition to basis can increase the new basis of any asset above its fair market value on the date of death.

The allocations of the general basis increase and other increases must be made by the executor, or other person in possession of a decedent's property, and must be reported to IRS and the property recipients.

Generally, if an estate is less than or equal to $5,000,000 ($10,000,000 for a married couple), the likely choice will be to remain subject to the estate tax rules (and receive the step-up in basis to date-of-death fair market value). However, in many cases, the circumstances will be more complex and will require careful analysis to determine whether or not to elect out of the default estate tax rules. For these situations, other specific factors will be considered and decisions will depend on each person's specific circumstances.

3939,"Protecting Your Attorney-Client Privilege Today","<p>The attorney-client privilege is, in its broad outlines, familiar to most people. The privilege belongs to the client and covers confidential communications by the client to his or her attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The privilege also covers the legal advice given by the attorney to the client in response to the client's request. The effect of the privilege is to protect these confidential communications from, for example, forced disclosure in a lawsuit. However, because the privilege depends upon the communications remaining confidential, it may be lost or ""waived"" if the communications are made in the presence of a third party or otherwise disclosed to a third party.</p><p>In the not too distant past, preservation of the confidentiality of these privileged attorney-client communications was relatively routine and easy to protect. Many of these communications were documentary in form, legended as ""confidential"" and ""privileged"", and placed in files marked ""confidential"" or ""attorney-client communications"". The making and dissemination of copies of these confidential and privileged documents were within the control of the custodian of the files. This control reduced significantly the risk that the document or copies of the document, through inadvertence or otherwise, might be distributed to third parties or, in the case of large organizations, to employees who had no need to be involved in the privileged communications because the subject matter of the communications fell outside the scope of their employment duties and responsibilities. The risk of ""waiving"" or losing the privilege that attached to these communications was, therefore, manageable.</p><p>Advances in information technology have greatly complicated the protection of privileged attorney-client communications. Email communications have, to a large extent, replaced documentary communications. Discrete attorney-client communications, particularly in large organizations, not infrequently become part of lengthy email strands or ""strings"", which consist largely of non-privileged, business communications. These email ""strings"" may now be forwarded to numerous recipients with one click of a computer mouse. These features of modern-day communications greatly increase the risk of attorney-client communications being sent to third parties or to employees who are outside the scope of the privilege and, therefore, greatly increase the risk of ""waiving"" or losing the privilege that would otherwise attach to the attorney-client communications buried within the email ""string"".</p><p>It has become routine for attorneys to place on all emails a footer or tag which characterizes the communication as privileged and requests unintended recipients to destroy and/or return electronic documents without reading them. These footers are usually in small print. They do little or nothing to alert a client that by forwarding the email or by including it in a string of emails any privilege attached to the communication may be waived and lost.</p><p>These risks may be significantly reduced in several ways. First, an attorney should take the time to discuss with clients the risks involved in communicating privileged information via email. Second, the attorney should clearly and at the beginning of an electronic communication to a client identify the communication as privileged. This can be accomplished by creating a conspicuous legend similar to the following: ""PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT MATERIAL--DO NOT FORWARD."" Third, the client can adopt and implement a requirement that all attorney-client email communications must bear a legend identifying them as such and that careful consideration must be given before forwarding these communications. Fourth, given the fallibility of human nature, computer programs and applications can be installed which will prevent privileged material so legended from being forwarded by the recipient. Although the protection afforded by these programs and applications is not absolute, circumvention requires effort and, for this reason, these devices should serve to prevent inadvertent or unintended dissemination of privileged materials.</p><p>Although these measures may seem burdensome, new Court Rules and discovery techniques relating to electronic storage of information make it increasingly likely that emails and other electronically stored documents that relate to litigation strategy and legal advice will become available to adversaries. And in non-litigation matters, legal advice not intended to be transmitted to employees and competitors may, through inadvertence or otherwise, be so transmitted and lose the protection of the attorney-client privilege.</p><p>We recommend public entities consider adopting guidelines for the use of e-mails, texting or other electronic communication to avoid possible violations of the Open Public Meetings Act.

3941,"PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTORS WHO MAKE MISTAKES CAN WITHDRAW THEIR BID","A new law allows public works contractors to withdraw their bids if they make a ""mistake"" in their bid. The law, effective March 4, 2011, applies to all contracting units covered by the Local Public Contracts Law. A mistake is defined in the statute (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-2) as:
<blockquote>""Mistake"" means, for a public works project, a clerical error that is an unintentional and substantial computational error or an unintentional omission of a substantial quantity of labor, material or both, from the final bid computation. (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-2(42))</blockquote>
In order to use this ""mistake"" provision to withdraw a bid, the bidder must submit a written request via certified mail to the public entity within five (5) business days after opening of the bid. If the public entity plans to award the contract within the five (5) days, then the low bidder should be contacted to make sure he is not contemplating withdrawal of his bid. The bidder must include in his request to withdraw any pertinent documents demonstrating that a mistake was made.

There are four criteria that must be met for a bid to be withdrawn. These criteria are:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The enforcement of the contract, if actually made, would be unconscionable.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The mistake relates to a material feature of the bid;</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The mistake occurred notwithstanding the fact that the bidder exercised reasonable care in preparation of the bid.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>If the bidder is allowed to withdraw his bid, it will not seriously prejudice the contracting unit except for the loss of bargain to the contracting unit.</li>
</ol>
The public entities purchase agent, legal counsel or administrator should review the request to withdraw along with the documentation to determine if the criteria have been met for the withdrawal of the bid. Once a determination is made regarding the withdrawal of the bid, a recommendation should be forwarded to the governing body. The governing body should act on that recommendation at its next regular meeting. If the governing body approves of the withdrawal of the bid, then the decision should be memorialized by resolution and include a provision for a return of the bidder's bid bond. Once the bidder is allowed to withdraw its bid, this bidder is disqualified from bidding on the same project, even if all bids are rejected. (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-13.2)

Allowing a bid to be withdrawn can often be beneficial to the public entity. Pressing a contractor to proceed on a contract where the bid is ""under priced"" can often lead to a contractor trying to cut corners on a project or a contentious contractual relationship. Change orders are not a legal way to correct these types of mistakes since change orders are restricted to use in the circumstances set forth in the regulations.

3944,"New Jersey Tax Court Upholds Realty Transfer Fee Exemption for Nominal Corporate Transfers","<strong>By <a title=""Mark K. Follender"" href=""/attorneys/partners/mark-k-follender/"">Mark K. Follender</a></strong> | On October 30, 2009, the New Jersey Tax Court, in the matter of Mack-Cali Realty, LP, et al. vs. Clerk of Bergen County, et al., Tax Court of New Jersey Docket No. 000037-2008, granted Summary Judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs seeking an exemption from payment of the Realty Transfer Fee. The Plaintiffs were represented by Mark K. Follender, a partner with Scarinci Hollenbeck.

Contrary to the position urged by the Division of Taxation, the Court held that the State could not impose a blanket exclusion of corporate transfers from the statutorily-permitted exemption for transfers involving less than $100. The result of the case avoided the payment of a deed recording fee of over $190,000.

<strong>Background</strong>

In 1968, New Jersey adopted N.J.S.A. 46:15-1 et seq., (“Realty Transfer Fee” statute) which imposed a fee upon the recording of a deed. The fee was a percentage based on the actual consideration received by the grantor. A specific provision of the statute, however (N.J.S.A. 46:15-10 (a)), provided an exemption from payment of the fee for transfers involving consideration of less than $100.00.

In the instant matter, the Plaintiff sought to transfer two parcels of real property from one corporately owned entity to two others under common control, and asserted that the transfer was for less than $100.00. There was no mortgage encumbering the realty and the transfer was being performed for internal corporate purposes. Consistent with the past practice of 38 years, the Plaintiff prepared an affidavit of consideration asserting consideration of less than $100 and properly expected to pay no realty transfer fee.

Upon presentation of the Deeds and Affidavit to the Bergen County Clerk’s Office, the Deeds were rejected with a reference to a newly enacted regulation from the Division of Taxation (N.J.A.C. 18:16-6.1), asserting that no corporate to corporate transfer of real property, even though under common ownership, could occur without consideration. Given that the property was unencumbered by a mortgage, the Clerk advised that the realty transfer fee to be paid should be calculated upon the fully equalized assessed value of the property. The Clerk also asserted that, because the property was a commercial office building and subject to the mansion tax, a total fee in excess of two percent (2%) of the equalized assessed value of the real property was required and made a fee demand of over $190,000.

In upholding the Clerk’s conduct, the Division of Taxation reasoned that since there was no mortgage, the value of the consideration was indeterminable and therefore, the only proper measure of the value of the transaction was the fully equalized assessed value.

<strong>Tax Court Ruling</strong>

N.J.S.A.46:15-5(C) specifically defines “consideration“ to include the balance of a mortgage encumbering real property. Earlier cases held that in a corporate to corporate transaction, where a mortgage is present, the tax is calculated only on the balance of the mortgage. Follender urged that the lack of an open mortgage should not redound to a recording party’s detriment.

Based on the earlier decisions, the Tax Court rejected the State’s arguments and sided with the Plaintiff, reasoning that the imposition of an exorbitant fee, on a transaction that involved no payment of money, specifically because there was no mortgage encumbering the property, created an inconsistency and anomaly not contemplated by the statute.

<strong>Significant Implications</strong>

The ruling of the Court has significant implications as it affects among other things commercial mortgage financing and proper estate planning.

In commercial financing, lenders frequently require that to be eligible for financing, a property must be held in a single asset or single purpose entity. If a corporate entity holds two or more parcels and desires to finance only one, it will most typically create a new entity and transfer for no consideration the identified parcel into the newly created entity. The State’s position would require payment of a fee in such nominal transactions.

Similarly, in the absence of this ruling, a parent-controlled entity that may decide to contribute for no payment the real estate owned by that entity to a newly created entity for purposes of a family limited partnership or other valid estate planning vehicle, would again be required to pay a full realty transfer fee as though an actual sale had occurred even though there was truly no consideration and no money changed hands. (Please note that in all of such instances, these illustrations contemplate there being no present mortgage encumbering the real property to be transferred.)

Accordingly, the ruling of Judge Pizzuto properly tracks the statute and the express intention of the legislature and clears the way for the recording of deeds without a realty transfer fee in nominal consideration corporate transactions.

3946,"Should You Make A Loan To Your Child? Yes! Using the Current Rates to Your Advantage","<strong>By <a title=""Frank L. Brunetti"" href=""/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/"">Frank L. Brunetti</a> </strong>| During the month of October is the time to make a loan to your child[1]. Why? Because the imputed interest rate for October is at an all-time low and therefore as a planning tool, you can move wealth to your children gift and estate tax free.

Generally, loans between related parties are governed by the IRS code so that related parties cannot assign income without adverse tax consequences. There is a small exclusion between related parties so that a loan of $10,000 generally does not require that interest be charged.

In some cases, if a loan of $100,000 or less is made between related parties, there is no imputed interest to the lender, so long as the borrow does not earn more than $1,000 from investments. If the borrower earns a greater amount, then the lender can be charged with interest income.

Because of the current extremely low interest rate environment, making a loan to a child can avoid the imputed interest charge and shift wealth to the borrower.

The following illustrates the advantage of making a loan using the low applicable federal interest rates (AFR):

Let's assume that a $1,000,000 loan is made to your child. The loan will require that you use the current applicable rate for a short term loan- 0.16%. A short term loan is a loan with a term of less than three years, assuming that the child pays the interest rate due of $16,000 annually. After three years a child will pay $48,000.

Now, assume that the child invests the $1,000,000 in a market investment returning 4%. At the end of three years the return on the investment will be $120,000. The net benefit to the child is $72,000 ($120,000-$48,000). Now couple this with annual gifts to the child of the current annual exclusion of $13,000, which for two parents is $26,000. The net benefit (and wealth shift) to the child over the three years is $150,000, including gifts. The parent will receive back his or her $1,000,000, plus the earned interest.

The transaction is simply a loan document with a term of three years or less and actual interest payments when payments are due.

This simple technique, when applied to several children, can pass wealth at no tax cost (gift or income) to the parents. If the borrower were a trust for the benefit of the child, the net benefit earned on the investment and by way of annual, gift can be protected from creditors and be available for the child during his/her lifetime.

This simple chart underscores the advantage of making a low interest loan to a child using the current interest rates:

3950,"ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL GOES FOR THE GOLD Passaic Hospital Unleashes Slew of Creditor Suits","<strong>By Joel R. Glucksman</strong> | In March, 2009, St. Mary's Hospital in Passaic filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In February 2010, the bankruptcy court confirmed St. Mary's plan of reorganization, and the hospital emerged from bankruptcy. Its confirmed plan gave general unsecured creditors a recovery estimated by the St. Mary's First Amended Disclosure Statement to be less than 5%.

This month, the trust established by St. Mary's reorganization plan filed over a hundred lawsuits, largely against these same creditors, seeking to recover so-called ""preferential transfers."" What is going on here?""

Preferential transfers"" are payments within ninety days before bankruptcy that allow the payee to do better than other creditors. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code makes ""preferences"" unlawful and requires that payee return them. In the end stages of business bankruptcies, the bankrupt's checkbook will be scoured and suit filed against anyone who received a payment within the ninety day period.

Preference lawsuits are typically treacherous for creditors. They are upsetting, since creditors are already owed money by the bankrupt and now are being sued to cough up even more. Also, the Bankruptcy Code lets such lawsuits be served by regular mail; they are therefore often overlooked. Worse, unlike civil suits, preference answers must be filed within thirty-five days of when the court issues the summons -- not from when the creditor is served. It is therefore often only when a default judgment is entered that the creditor focuses on the threat.

There are defenses that can be raised. They require more explanation than can be given here, but creditors can often insulate from liability payments made as contemporaneous exchanges, or made in the ordinary course of business, or that were followed by the creditor providing new value to the bankrupt. These defenses are ""fact based"" and need to be discussed with experienced bankruptcy counsel.

3952,"State Guidelines for Awarding Service Contracts by Contracting Units","<strong>By Sheri K. Siegelbaum </strong>| The State Comptroller on March 4, 2010 issued a “best practices” guide for government contracting units for awarding service contracts. Although it is not mandatory that entities follow these guidelines, the State Comptroller is recommending that these “best practices” be adopted as law. Therefore, we strongly recommend that all public entities follow these practices and develop a procedure for awarding professional service contracts that meets the goals set forth in this update.

The guidelines do not apply to contracts awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. There are six main principles:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The pool of contractors solicited should be as expansive as possible.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Statement of work to be performed should be drafted in clear and unambiguous terms.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Proposals should be judged on the basis of predetermined, merit-based evaluative criteria, made known to vendors before proposals are submitted.
<ul>
	<li>Evaluative criteria should include management criteria, technical criteria, cost and past experience and performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The evaluative criteria should be judged by a qualified evaluation committee.
<ul>
	<li>The committee should be established before the request for proposals are sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
	<li>The committee members should include someone with the expertise to analyze that service (ie., engineer for engineering services.)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
	<li>Committee members should be screened for conflicts of interest.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The evaluation process should be explainable to evaluators and competing vendors and capable of withstanding scrutiny under a protest challenge.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The scoring process and award recommendations should be well-documented and retained.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>A contracting unit should establish an evaluative process including, scoring sheets, written record of permitted negotiations, written comparative analysis of proposals and written recommendation of the committee.</li>

3958,"Terminating Retiree Benefit Plans -- New Impediments from the Courts","<strong>By Joel R. Glucksman</strong> | A July 13, 2010 Third Circuit ruling significantly burdens firms planning to use bankruptcy to restructure. Simply put, they can no longer freely modify retiree benefit plans (neither in bankruptcy nor within six months beforehand) even if their plan’s plain language lets them do so!

Bankruptcy Code §1114 limits a company’s ability to modify retiree plans for medical, disability, or death benefits. This applies to modifications proposed during, or up to six months before, bankruptcy. The company must first: (i) make a good faith proposal to the workers, (ii) which they reject, and (iii) which the bankruptcy court finds is fair, equitable, and “clearly favored by the balance of the equities.”

Visteon Corp’s plan, however, contained a reservation giving Visteon the unilateral right to terminate. In its bankruptcy, Visteon therefore moved to terminate the plan. Despite this plain language, and contradicting rulings from other federal courts, the Third Circuit denied Visteon, instead requiring that it first satisfy the requirements of §1114.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">IUE-CWA v. Visteon Corp. (In re Visteon Corp.)</span> has significant ramifications. Within the Third Circuit, it increases employee bargaining power when a company is distressed. It also weakens the incentive for other creditors to attempt workouts, since less free cash will now be available. And, it makes timing important: A company considering bankruptcy must now pay more careful attention to the six month “look-back” of §1114.",,20111107,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/legal-updates/terminating-retiree-benefit-plans-new-impediments-from-the-courts/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Legal Updates",,publish,5,terminating-retiree-benefit-plans-new-impediments-from-the-courts,,,0,0,open,closed
3960,"Uncover Potential Liability with a Website Audit","<strong>By <a title=""Fred D. Zemel"" href=""/attorneys/partners/fred-d-zemel/"">Fred D. Zemel</a> </strong>| Websites are used by businesses to increase revenue by expanding visibility in the marketplace. In that regard, businesses devote much time, effort and expense to fine tuning the look, feel and functionalities of their websites. However, since people are frequently unaware that their website is a source of potential liability, they fail to have a website audit performed on their website. A website audit is a legal review of a website (1) to determine how the website may be deficient or problematic from a legal perspective, and (2) to recommend modifications which should be made to the website to resolve those deficiencies or problems.

Consider the following: your website is accessible to an endless amount of people through the World Wide Web. You have no control over who views your website, whether they will be damaged as a result of relying on information presented through your website or as a result of damaging code, such as viruses, passed through your site, or whether they will sue you as a result of those damages. In the day and age where litigation is frequently turned to as an avenue of relief and too often juries return verdicts with lottery-type damages, understanding, evaluating and properly addressing the risks created by your website is critical. Moreover, since website audits are typically relatively inexpensive, the cost/benefit analysis leans strongly in favor of having a website audit performed.

When website audits are performed, the following are some of the issues primarily reviewed and analyzed:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Website Terms of Use</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Privacy Policy</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Infringement of Third Party Rights</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Protection of Website Owner Intellectual Property Rights</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Review of Contracts for Website Design and Operation</li>
</ul>
Deficiencies in the areas described above could be a source of significant liability to website owners. By having a website audit performed, website owners are able to identify where they are at risk of liability to end users and determine what remedial action they want to take in order to mitigate that risk.

The following is an explanation of the issues presented above and how they are addressed through website audits:

<strong>Terms of Use</strong>

A website’s Terms of Use is, in its broadest terms, an agreement between the website owner and end users who access the website. Terms of Use contain the conditions under which end users are permitted to access a website, utilize information posted on a website and use website functionalities. Terms of Use also provide limitations on the rights of end users if they wish to seek damages against a website owner. For example, issues such as Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liabilities, Applicable Law and Jurisdiction, and Arbitration are usually addressed in Terms of Use.

Once a website owner recognizes the importance of Terms of Use, the form of the Terms of Use must be considered. As with other agreements, there is no such thing as “one size fits all” with Terms of Use. Rather, when drafting Terms of Use, it is important to understand the type of information and functionalities contained on a website and the anticipated manner in which end users will rely on that information and use those functionalities. For example, a website which contains gardening information would likely expose the website owner to less risk of significant third party claims than would a website which contains information on medical conditions. Once a proper assessment of a website is made, then Terms of Use tailored to the website can be properly drafted. However, it is fairly apparent that if one were to take Terms of Use which are adequate for a gardening website and apply them to a medical website, the owner of the medical website would likely have failed to properly address or adequately minimize the greater risk created by the medical website.

As shown above, having website Terms of Use is an important element in protecting the interests of website owners. Equally important, however, is ensuring that the Terms of Use are properly tailored to the website for which they are used.

<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>

A website’s Privacy Policy sets out the parameters under which the website owner intends to use end user data collected through the website. End user data collected through a website may be in the form of personally identifiable information or information which is derived from end users but which does not personally identify the end users. Examples of personally identifiable information include names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and other similar information which can be used to identify specific persons. In addition to the collection of personally identifiable information which is actively provided by end users, website owners may use “cookies” in order to identify end users who have previously visited the website, to extract certain information from those end users, and to gear certain advertising to those end users.

Once website owners have end user personal data, the website owner will determine how sensitively (or not) they will treat that data. Will they only use the data to directly communicate to end users regarding goods and services provided by the website owner, or will they permit third parties to use that data to market unrelated goods and services to end users?

Due to the fact that end users have varying expectations as to how their data will be used, if an end user feels that those expectations have been exceeded, the end user may sue the website owner for violating the end user’s privacy rights and/or applicable laws. In anticipation of such claims, website owners have the ability to convey to end users through the website’s Privacy Policy how it is intended by the website owner that the end user data will be used. By informing end users of the website owner’s intentions, end user expectations should be set so that the end user is not surprised by the scope of the website owner’s use of end user data.

<strong>Infringement of Third Party Rights</strong>

Websites frequently make use of content which is protected by third party intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark rights. Whenever third party intellectual property rights are involved, it is important that the rights of the owner of those intellectual property rights be considered and proper steps be taken, where necessary, to agree with that owner on the permitted use of the subject matter of those rights. For example, if a website owner intends to reproduce an article written by another person, the website owner must consider whether such reproduction, if done without the author’s consent, would infringe the author’s copyright in the article. Additionally, if a website owner infringes the trademark of a third party, the website owner may be subject to statutory treble damages.

In addition to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights, websites may infringe on the rights of others by linking to other websites without permission. Moreover, the problems caused by unpermitted linking to another’s website are potentially exacerbated when the linking involved is “deep linking,” i.e., linking to a page on a website other than the website’s home page.

As noted above, due to the fact that websites are accessible through the World Wide Web, the ability of third parties to access a person’s website is unlimited. When that unlimited accessibility is coupled with the motivation third parties have to determine where their rights may be infringed and the ability of those third parties to take legal action to protect those rights, it is clearly important to assess whether a website infringes the rights of third parties, and if so, what steps should be taken to address that situation.

<strong>Protection of Website Owner Intellectual Property Rights</strong>

Identification of how a website may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties is important. Similarly, determining what intellectual property rights a website owner may have and what steps have been taken to protect those rights is also essential. Those rights may include, for example, trademarks and copyrights of the website owner. Proper protection of one’s intellectual property enables the owner of that intellectual property to prevent others from misusing that intellectual property. Further, if that intellectual property is used in a manner that is not permitted, the intellectual property owner may then sue to collect statutory damages from an infringing party.

Since intellectual property is a significant way in which one business effectively distinguishes itself from other similar businesses, the ease with which intellectual property is reproduced and infringed by others is a definite business risk. As a result, it is clearly important that website owners identify what their intellectual property assets are and determine what steps they have taken to protect them.

<strong>Review of Contracts for Website Design and Operation</strong>

Usually, website owners have website designers manage their websites in every respect. Website designers will frequently be charged with acquiring the website domain name, designing the website, hosting the website, and providing website maintenance. However, what website owners frequently do not realize is that the website designers may in their “form contract” retain ownership rights in the website, its design, content, and sometimes even in the domain name itself. Moreover, if there is no requirement that the website designer regularly transmit website content and end user data to the website owner, if the relationship with the website designer deteriorates, the website owner may find that they are unable to effectively migrate the website to another website designer/host.

The pitfalls and problems typically found in contracts with website designers are frequently not recognized at the time that those contracts are entered. As a result, it is important that website owners assess what problems may exist with their contracts, especially at a time when there is no dispute with the website designer/host. By doing so, website owners are able to approach the website designer/host in an effort to renegotiate the contract. If a website owner is unable to renegotiate their contract, then the website owner is at least able to understand what problems may exist and take independent action to work around those problems.

The issues raised above are just some of the ways in which a website audit helps website owners identify and manage risks to their businesses which are caused by websites.

3963,"WEST ORANGE FINALIZES BENCHMARK UNION AGREEMENT","After much negotiation, the Township of West Orange and the Unions of the Township's Fire Department came to a monumental agreement to avoid foreseen layoffs and demotions that many New Jersey municipalities succumbed during these tough economic times

The Unions, which include Union 28 F.M.B.A. (the rank and file firefighters) and the S.O.A. West Orange Fire Department (the Fire Superior Officers), agreed to an unprecedented contribution of 7.5% of pensionable base salary towards the costs of health benefits. This is the first occurrence within the state where a union negotiated this size contribution.

Before this deal was struck and with tough budgetary decisions in sight, the Township was forced to file a layoff and demotion plan with the Department of Civil Service in January 2011; the plan was ultimately approved. Faced with a possible 27 layoffs and/or demotions in the Fire Department, the Unions made great strides with Township Mayor Robert Parisi to avoid such actions.

Mayor Parisi strongly supported the compromises and on March 14, 2011, the Township's Council unanimously approved this benchmark final Agreement.

But, what if the lease states that rent becomes due on the first day of the month, and the tenant files bankruptcy on the tenth? Those twenty days after the filing are referred to as the ""stub"" period, and the courts differ on how they are treated.

In the Seventh Circuit, in the nation's midland, the courts require that a bankrupt tenant immediately and automatically pay stub rent. In New Jersey, however, in the Third Circuit, a recent court ruling rejected this approach, requiring that a landlord first demonstrate that its tenant received an actual economic benefit from the premises during the stub period. The case is In re Goody's Family Clothing Inc, and the Third Circuit relied on the principle that the ""billing date"" determines when a leasehold obligation arises. Thus, since the Goody's lease made rent due on the first of the month, and debtor filed bankruptcy on the ninth, the due date for rent occurred prior to the bankruptcy filing. Therefore, the payment of rent was not one of the leasehold obligations that a debtor must ""timely perform.""

Having said that, however, the court left the landlord a window. It allowed the landlord to file a motion and seek to prove that the debtor's use of the leasehold premises during the stub period conferred an actual and necessary economic benefit on the debtor. If so, the landlord was allowed to recover the reasonable value of the premises during the stub period.

Landlords facing the bankruptcy of a commercial tenant need to carefully plan their strategy and should not sleep on their rights.

3967,"Media Law Group Achieves Significant Victory","Thomas J. Cafferty, Nomi I. Lowy and Lauren James-Weir of Scarinci Hollenbeck’s Media Law Group won a major victory in federal court recently when Judge Joel Pisano granted summary judgment in favor of their clients, Millennium Radio Group, LLC (owner of WKXW 101.5 FM), and “shock jocks” Craig Carton and Ray Rossi, Defendants in the action.

The lawsuit stemmed from a photograph that was taken by photographer Peter Murphy, who was hired by New Jersey Monthly to illustrate NJM’s annual “Best of Jersey” awards in which Carton and Rossi were named the State’s top shock jocks for 2006. The photograph featured Carton and Rossi, seemingly nude, behind a sign identifying 101.5 FM, WKXW, the radio station for which they both worked at the time. Shortly after the photograph appeared in NJM, Defendants copied it and posted it on their WKXW website to inform their listeners of their award. Listeners then began submitting parodies of the photograph and Defendants posted thumbnail versions of these images on the website. At some point thereafter, Murphy’s attorney wrote to the radio station accusing the station of violating Murphy’s copyright. According to Murphy, after the letter was sent to the station, Carton and Rossi made certain on-air comments about Murphy, characterizing him in a factual way as “a man not to be trusted” in a business environment; a man who “will sue you if you have business dealings with him” and, in substance, as a man with whom “a person should avoid doing business.” Plaintiff further alleged that Carton and Rossi discussed the manner in which Murphy had them pose for the photograph and “derogatorily inferred Plaintiff was a homosexual.”

Murphy ultimately filed suit against Defendants alleging various copyright violations, violations of the Digital Management Copyright Act (DCMA) and defamation claims. Prior to any depositions being taken, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In response, Plaintiff filed a motion asserting that further discovery was needed and that the summary judgment motion was premature. Defendants countered that no further discovery was needed as Defendants were accepting as true, solely for the purposes of the summary judgment motion, all facts as asserted in Plaintiff’s Complaint. The Court agreed with Defendants and allowed the summary judgment motion to go forward.

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment included arguments that (1) the Digital Management Copyright Act did not apply to the facts of this case; (2) Defendants’ use of the work was classic “fair use;” (3) the on-air statements of Carton and Rossi were nothing more than rhetorical hyperbole; and (4) the assertion that someone is homosexual is not defamatory. The Court agreed with these arguments and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on all counts.",,20100728,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/media-law-group-achieves-significant-victory-2/,,,,,,,"Firm News",,publish,10,media-law-group-achieves-significant-victory-2,,,0,0,open,closed
4088,"OPEN PUBLIC RECORDS ACT UPDATE: Names and Addresses Subject to OPRA","<a href=""/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/OPRA-update-Names-and-addresses-subject-to-OPRA.pdf""><strong>Print this update</strong></a>

Recently questions have risen as to whether lists of names and addresses maintained by a public entity are subject to the Open Public Record Act (“OPRA”). Based on the statutory language and recent court decisions these lists appear to be subject to the Act.

In Plumsted Township, an individual requested the list of resident e-mail addresses for people who signed up to receive the Municipal electronic newsletter. The Plumsted Township Record Custodian denied the request due to concerns for the privacy interest of the Township’s residents. The Court ultimately held that the list of e-mail addresses maintained by the Township of Plumsted were subject to OPRA and had to be disclosed.

More recently, the New Jersey Appellate Division ordered that a mailing list of senior citizens compiled by Union County were subject to OPRA. The mailing list included the names and addresses of “senior citizens” who had signed up for copies of a senior newsletter from the County of Union.

These decisions emanating out of Ocean and Union County Superior Courts clearly evidence that public policy of New Jersey favors disclosure of mailing lists whether physical or electronic. In reaching these decisions the public’s interest in the mailing lists was balanced against the citizen’s interest in maintaining confidentiality. This analysis is flexible, fact sensitive and resolved on a case by case basis. Record Custodians throughout the State are regularly challenged with these difficult decisions. Helpful in making these daily decisions is that the Courts universally agree that a Records Custodian may redact information which discloses the social security number, credit card number, unlisted telephone number, or driver license number from a record prior to dissemination. The Court did confirm that “involuntary lists” (such as one created by dog licensees) are not subject to release under OPRA

However, in the Plumsted Township and Union County cases the Courts ultimately opined that physical or electronic mailing lists shall be freely accessible to the public. In light of these decisions Governmental entities will need to consider alerting residents that their addresses may be subject to dissemination if they sign up for electronic or paper newsletters. These warnings will help residents make informed decisions on whether they want to sign up to be on public entity mailing lists. Please contact our office for help drafting these warnings.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, June 8, 2012</strong> - Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue former Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin for defamation following her comments that the Miss USA pageant was rigged.

<strong><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/glitz-and-glam.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-5030 alignleft"" title=""glitz and glam"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/glitz-and-glam-300x300.jpg"" alt=""This is an image of a tiara used for the post DONALD TRUMP SUES FORMER MISS PENNSYLVANIA FOR DEFAMATION on the Scarinci Hollenbeck website "" width=""300"" height=""291"" /></a></strong>Trump owns the Miss Universe Organization, which put on the Miss USA Pageant held on June 3. Miss Rhode Island, Olivia Culpo, was crowned the winner.

Following the competition, Monnin, who did not finish among the top 15 contestants, resigned. In online comments, she claimed that the finalists were predetermined and the contest rigged. She stated that another contestant had seen a paper backstage, listing the top five finishers before the pageant had even begun.

Trump called her statements baseless and gave Monnin 24 hours to apologize and withdraw her comments in writing. Monnin refused, and Trump followed through with the defamation lawsuit.

To gain legal insight on the case, E! News interviewed <a href=""/attorneys/partners/anthony-r-caruso-esq/"">Anthony R. Caruso</a> the Chair of Scarinci Hollenbeck's <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law/"">Sports and Entertainment Group</a>. He previously defended former <a href=""http://youtu.be/2yaO7PIz6Kg"" target=""_blank"">Miss New Jersey Amy Polumbo</a> when she was blackmailed over online photographs in 2007. Caruso retains hope that the situation can be resolved without involving the courts.

""In my opinion this case is based more on emotion than legal positioning. I would certainly hope that the two parties would take a step back and reconcile their differences,"" Caruso says.

The contestant who Monnin says saw the list has stated that she did see the list but did not know what it was for. She also said her comment about those contestants being the finalists was a joke. Pageant officials have said Monnin told them she was upset about the organization's choice to allow transgender Miss Canada contestant Jenna Talackova to participate.

Further details are available in a post on Scarinci Hollenbeck's website. For more information, please tune in to E! News tonight at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. (ET) for the full interview.

5044,"NJ SUPERIOR COURT REJECTS BLOGGER'S SHIELD LAW DEFENSE","<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Blogger Shellee Hale Not Protected Under New Jersey Shield Law and Must Reveal Her Sources.</h3>
&nbsp;

<strong>Lyndhurst</strong><strong>, NJ</strong><strong>, June 12, 2012</strong> – The New Jersey Superior Court has ruled against blogger Shellee Hale's shield law defense, putting an end to a three-year dispute and allowing a defamation lawsuit brought against her by Scarinci Hollenbeck client Too Much Media to continue.

<a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-Constitution.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-5045 alignleft"" title=""Too much Media"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-Constitution-300x199.jpg"" alt=""This is an image of the U.S. Constitution used by Scarinci Hollenbeck LLC in their blog post regarding shield law defense "" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>The case concerns allegedly defamatory remarks that Washington <a href=""http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/blogger_not_protected_by_journ.html"" target=""_blank"">blogger Shellee Hale</a> made on message boards in 2009 against a New Jersey company <a href=""https://www.toomuchmedia.com"" target=""_blank"">Too Much Media</a> (“TMM”). Hale claimed to have inside information about purported fraud that TMM and its owners had committed upon consumers.

TMM sued Hale for defamation. She argued that she was a journalist and therefore protected under the New Jersey Shield Law, which allows reporters to protect the identity of their sources. The trial court disagreed and ruled that posting on message boards did not make her a journalist, and that she therefore was not protected under the Shield Law. Hale appealed the trial court ruling, but the appellate court affirmed the lower court's ruling.

The case then went to the New Jersey Superior Court, where the justices again rejected Hale’s claims. The case was returned to the trial court, where Hale next tried to argue she was writing a nonfiction book, and under new shield law standards, should be classified as a journalist.

Superior Court Judge Linda Grasso Jones dismissed her claims, noting that Hale had not previously mentioned writing a nonfiction work in her previous hearings, and had, in fact, testified in 2009 that she was completing a work of fiction.

Scarinci Hollenbeck attorney and partner Joel Kreizman, who represents Too Much Media, said the ruling puts an end to years of Hale’s efforts to avoid testifying concerning the basis of her statements about TMM and it owners.

""I am pleased with the court's ruling. The New Jersey Shield Law is designed to protect credible journalists from revealing legitimate sources,"" Kreizman said. ""Ms. Hale's manipulation of the law, and her attempts to thwart the court’s discovery process, is finally at an end.

Unless an appellate court entertains another appeal by Hale, she will now be required to appear for a deposition in the Too Much Media defamation lawsuit.

<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, June 28, 2012</strong> - In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wilson v. City of Jersey City</span>, the New Jersey Supreme Court confirmed the broad ranging immunities conferred upon 911 Operators pursuant to the 911 Immunity Act in Title 52 of the New Jersey Statutes.  The Supreme Court then remanded the case to the Appellate Division to determine whether summary judgment should be granted to the City of Jersey City and its 911 Operators.

Today, in a ruling of first impression, the Appellate Division held that summary judgment was appropriately granted to the City of Jersey City and its 911 operators. The appellate court laid out in detail the analysis necessary to warrant application of the 911-related immunities. It further opined that municipalities and other public safety answering points will be immune from respondeat superior liability for the conduct of 911 operators under additional immunities provided by the Tort Claims Act in Title 59 of the New Jersey Statutes.

This ruling has broad statewide impact, as it concerns the potential liability of all governmental entities and their employees operating 911 services.

The case was argued by <a href=""/attorneys/partners/robert-e-levy/"">Robert E. Levy</a>, Chair of Scarinci Hollenbeck’s <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">Litigation</a> Group.  Also participating in the case were Scarinci Hollenbeck attorneys <a href=""/attorneys/counsel/michael-a-cifelli/"">Michael Cifelli</a> and CJ Griffin.

Cliffside Park’s $140M Towne Centre project is expected to start next month, according to The Record. The mixed use project will contain more than 270 residential units, with nearly 50,000 square feet of retail and office space.  The Towne Centre project has been on the drawing board since at least 1999 and will cover a 3.3 acre site on Anderson Avenue.  As part of the transaction, the Borough of Cliffside Park will be provided with a 190 space parking lot facility.  The project will also include a public space outdoor plaza with a fountain and outdoor seating.

Mr. Marsico drafted and negotiated the sophisticated ground lease mortgage loan documentation and worked with counsel for the developers. He also worked with representatives of the Borough of Cliffside Park to resolve the terms of the complex redevelopment agreement for the site, and to finalize the provisions of a long term ground lease between the city and the development entity.

He comments, “It was a pleasure to be able to represent TD Bank, N.A. on this matter and to participate in the redevelopment process of an important property in the Borough of Cliffside Park.  It was especially satisfying to see the developers and town officials work together with our client, TD Bank, N.A. to drive forward a beautiful addition to the municipality.  We at Scarinci Hollenbeck were happy to be able to assist TD Bank, N.A. in providing the necessary financing to move the project forward.”

The Towne Centre is estimated to take between 18 – 24 months to complete.

5314,"JUDGE DISMISSES ENVIRONMENTAL SUIT AGAINST CORPORATE OFFICER","<h3 align=""center""><a href=""/attorneys/""><strong>Scarinci Hollenbeck</strong></a><strong> Attorneys Show Personal Jurisdiction Not Automatic Following Corporate Actions in Environmental Case</strong></h3>
<strong>Lyndhurst, N.J., August 15, 2012</strong> - Scarinci Hollenbeck was involved in a recent decision in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey that found corporate officers do not immediately fall under a Court's jurisdiction based on the jurisdiction it may have over the corporation.

The case was <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Virginia Street Fidelco, L.L.C</span>. v. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Orbis Products Corp</span>., a CERCLA and New Jersey Spill Act case seeking environmental cost recovery relating to a former Orbis Products contaminated site at 55 Virginia Street in Newark, New Jersey.

In the amended complaint, Vernon G. Browne, a former financial vice president of Norda, Inc., Orbis Products' parent company, had been personally named as a defendant.

Scarinci Hollenbeck Attorneys <a href=""/attorneys/counsel/william-c-sullivan-jr/"">William C. Sullivan</a> and <a href=""/attorneys/partners/john-m-scagnelli/"">John M. Scagnelli</a>, a Partner at Scarinci Hollenbeck and Chair of the firm's Environmental and Land Use Group, represented Mr. Browne. They asked the Court to dismiss the individual claim against Mr. Browne due to a lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of process.

They held that Mr. Browne's limited contact with Orbis as part of his work as a corporate officer of Orbis’ parent company, Norda, Inc., did not create the personal jurisdiction necessary in this case, particularly because his name did not appear in any of the documentation relating to environmental issues at the property.

U.S. Judge Stanley Chesler of the District of New Jersey agreed. In his ruling, he said that the plaintiffs, ""failed to provide anything to support the inference that Browne had any relevant contact with the forum, such that any claim arose out of that contact.""

His ruling reaffirmed the position that each defendant's contacts with the forum state must be assessed individually, and do not necessarily follow a Court's jurisdiction over the company. Mr. Browne's attorneys applauded the decision.

""This ruling reaffirms clear limits on the level of responsibility placed on corporate officers for environmental law claims,"" said Scagnelli. ""Any other ruling could have made every corporate officer personally liable for contamination regardless of their contact with those facilities.""

The dismissal covered only the individual claim against Mr. Browne. The case at large remains open.

5400,"BPU ORDERS JCP&L SEEKING RATE REVIEW","<h2>In an unusual move – indeed, believed to be the first time ever – the <strong>New Jersey Board of Public Utilities</strong> (“BPU” or “Board”) has issued an Order directing a <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/board-of-public-utilities/"" name=""this is a link to the firm's public utility law practice page"">public utility</a> to file a base rate case petition so that the BPU can determine whether the company’s rates for electric service are just and reasonable.</h2>
The proceeding was initiated at the instance of the Division of Rate Counsel (“Rate Counsel”), which filed a petition asserting that, based upon publicly available data, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. (“JCP&amp;L” or “Company”) is earning an unreasonable rate of return.  Noting that more than <strong>six years had elapsed</strong> since the Company’s last base rate case, Rate Counsel contended that a new rate proceeding would help ensure that JCP&amp;L makes needed capital investments so as to allow it to provide safe, adequate and proper service.  Rate Counsel also requested that the Board direct JCP&amp;L to utilize a 2010 historical test year in its filing.

JCP&amp;L opposed the request, stating that Rate Counsel had failed to demonstrate that the Company’s rates were unjust and unreasonable and that Rate Counsel had not provided sufficient reason for the Board to order JCP&amp;L to file a base rate case at this time.  JCP&amp;L also asserted that Rate Counsel’s analysis was flawed and that it inappropriately focused on the Company’s overall rate of return (“ROR”) rather than its achieved return on equity (“ROE”), which the Company maintained is the primary factor considered in base rate cases.

Rate Counsel utilized data from JCP&amp;L’s filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, concluding that the Company has exceeded its allowed ROR of 8.5%, as established in JCP&amp;L’s last base rate case.  It also argued that data relied upon by JCP&amp;L were “flawed” and “unsupported.”  It further posited that JCP&amp;L’s “history of reliability problems warrant[ed] a base rate case review of the Company’s captial spending and investments.”

In turn, JCP&amp;L argued that the data utilized by Rate Counsel were improper and that the Board should examine data based upon the Company’s 2012 budget, adjusted for a revised sales forecast and for known, actual results through March 31, 2012, including weather-adjusted revenues and<em> pro forma</em> and post-test year adjustments.  The Company argued that ROE is the proper matrix upon which the Board should base its decision.  Utilizing this approach, JCP&amp;L stated that its ROE for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2011, was 10.1%, a rate within a “zone of reasonableness.”  Using the same methodology, JCP&amp;L stated that for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, its ROE dropped to 9.29%

JCP&amp;L also argued that Rate Counsel’s filing utilized “stale” 2010 data and that it “contain[ed] numerous manifest errors.”  It opined that “using 2010 data to determine whether a utility’s rates are just and reasonable in 2012 would be akin to retroactive ratemaking.”  JCP&amp;L similarly argued that Rate Counsel’s petition “failed to make standard ratemaking adjustments.”  In contrast, JCP&amp;L claimed that its own analysis was “conservative,” as it included many ratemaking adjustments with which the Company disagreed and which it would not necessarily include in a rate filing, but which it believed Rate Counsel and Board Staff usually proposed.  JCP&amp;L contended that its analysis “on the ‘whole demonstrates that JCP&amp;L’s rates are within the zone of reasonableness and there is no need for a base rate proceeding.’”  Indeed, JCP&amp;L pointed out that its rates have decreased “significantly” since 2002 and that they are the lowest electric rates among the four New Jersey electric distribution companies (“EDCs”).

JCP&amp;L further reasoned that the fact that it had not filed a base rate case for several years should not be a basis upon which to order that a new case be filed.  It maintained that no legal or regulatory precedent or factual basis correlates the length of term between rate cases with the reasonableness of a utility’s base rates, and that the Company should not be penalized for effectively managing its business so as to avoid the need for frequent base rate cases.  Similarly, JCP&amp;L said that the length of time since the filing of the Company’s last base rate case [in 2005] has not affected its system-wide reliability.  Indeed, it argued that its Annual System Performance Reports have shown an overall positive trend over the last ten years.  Moreover, the Company contended that “it has improved system reliability since its last base rate case and that recent reliability investigations do not warrant a forced base rate case filing.”  It therefore urged that “references to unrelated service issues ... serve[d] to highlight [Rate Counsel’s] misunderstanding of the utility business.”

Conceding that no reported cases exist regarding the burden of proof where a third party challenges Board-approved rates, JCP&amp;L pointed to federal law as instructive, arguing that under the Federal Power Act, the burden of proof is on either the tribunal or the complainant “to establish that the current rate is unjust and unreasonable.”

An intervenor in the case, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation (“Gerdau”), contended that there was no dispute as to the Board’s legal authority to issue an order directing the initiation of a base rate case and that, because material issues exist with regard to JCP&amp;L’s current earnings, revenue requirements and the appropriate level of an allowed return, such an order should be issued.  Gerdau also asserted that the Board should examine the “continuing justness and reasonableness of the cost allocation and rate design of JCP&amp;L’s distribution rates.”  Gerdau contended that JCP&amp;L’s comparison of its rates to other EDCs was irrelevant to the Board’s determination as to whether JCP&amp;L’s revenues are in line with its actual costs.

Also participating in the case was <strong>AARP</strong>.  Contending that JCP&amp;L should be forced to file a base rate case, AARP asserted that ratepayers should not have to rely solely on a company’s desire to initiate such a proceeding in order for the Board to examine the reasonableness of its base rates.

<strong>In its decision</strong>, the Board noted its overarching mission to “ensure that regulated public utilities provide <strong>safe, adequate and proper service</strong> to the citizens of New Jersey” and that the <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2530675780_66120e9012.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5407"" title=""BPU orders Rate Review "" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2530675780_66120e9012-300x150.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""150"" /></a>Public Utilities Act, which vests the BPU with the power to generally supervise and regulate public utilities, should be read broadly and construed liberally.  Issues involving rates, determined the Board, “must balance the interests of utility investors and ratepayers in determining what is ‘just and reasonable.’”  Citing <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">In re N.J. Power and Light Co.</span>, 9 <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">N.J.</span> 498, 534 (1952)</strong>, the Board concluded that “[a] utility’s rate of return must fall ‘within the range of reasonableness, the zone between the lowest rate not confiscatory and the highest rate fair to the public.’”  The Board analyzed the matter before it as presenting three general issues:  JCP&amp;L’s earnings, the lapse of time since the Company’s last base rate case, and reliability/infrastructure issues.  Given the complexity of those issues and the fact that they would very likely be inter-related, the Board found that directing JCP&amp;L to file a base rate case would be “the most efficacious method to address a number of regulatory concerns.”

As to earnings, the Board concluded that, “at this time, [it could not] properly evaluate any claims that JCP&amp;L is overearning.”  It also concluded that “[a] base rate case will clarify the zone of reasonableness for this company under current economic conditions, and allow the Board to set just and reasonable rates on a prospective basis, and provide JCP&amp;L with revenues necessary to attract capital on reasonable terms.”

While stating that not filing a base rate case for a long period of time is not an indication of mismanagement, and may in fact reflect good management, the Board nevertheless determined that “an absence as long as JCP&amp;L’s” impacted the opportunity to thoroughly examine JCP&amp;L’s finances and operations.

The Board also addressed the question of JCP&amp;L’s service related issues, noting that it had previously determined JCP&amp;L to be deficient in certain respects with regard to storm restoration,  planning and preparation.  The Board did note that JCP&amp;L had committed to implementing certain recommendations presented to the Board with regard to service and facilities, but concluded that, “[g]iven the extent of reliability concerns with JCP&amp;L’s system, questions of system performance and investment would be best investigated in the context of a base rate case where the financial impact of any additional investments can be determined as an aid in decision-making.”

In sum, the Board determined that a base rate proceeding “will assure that JCP&amp;L’s rates are just and reasonable, and that the Company is investing sufficiently to assure the provision of safe, adequate and proper utility service to its customers ....”

With regard to the test year, the Board concluded that it would be appropriate for JCP&amp;L to utilize an historical test year of 2011 so as to better capture the Company’s spending patterns and capital needs.  It further determined, however, that the Company should have the opportunity to establish “known and measurable” changes to the test year.

JCP&amp;L's filing is due by November 1, 2012.

Under the <strong>New Jersey Site Remediation Reform Act</strong> (SRRA), N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.16, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is required to rank New Jersey contaminated sites in its Remedial Priority Scoring (RPS) System.  The SRRA required NJDEP to establish a ranking system establishing categories of sites based upon the level of risk to the public health, safety, or the environment, the length of time the site has been undergoing remediation, the economic impact of the contaminated site on the municipality and surrounding property, and other factors deemed relevant by NJDEP.

The RPS System is a computerized model which NJDEP has developed to categorize New Jersey contaminated sites based upon these factors.  The RPS model utilizes multiple geographic data bases and layers, receptor information, and site specific groundwater, soil, and vapor intrusion sampling data in determining a site score.  The RPS score equals the Site Condition Score times the Receptor Score.  The Site Condition Score is the type and extent of contaminants at a site and the Receptor Score is determined by the proximity of receptors to a site based upon the existence of a pathway between the contamination and the receptors.  Once the RPS score is determined, the Site  is cataloged for relative ranking with sites with similar scores and is placed into Categories 1 through 5.  Category 1 represents the lowest score and the least potential risk, and Category 5 represents the highest score and the greatest potential risk.  NJDEP will use the RPS information to help determine whether appropriate remedial measures are being implemented at a given site or whether direct NJDEP oversight of remediation at the site is needed.

In or about May 2012, NJDEP sent out letters to persons identified as responsible for conducting remediation at sites which attached current NJDEP database information relating to the site and which requested that the responsible person correct or update the listed information.  NJDEP is providing responsible persons with this opportunity to correct or update the input values relating to their sites before NJDEP runs the RPS model and posts the results relating to the site.  The deadline for responsible persons to provide updated and corrected information relating to their sites to NJDEP is September 30, 2012.  While submission of this information is voluntary, it is important that you review NJDEP’s database information relating to your site and make the necessary corrections and updates so that your New Jersey contaminated site is correctly ranked in NJDEP’s Remedial Priority Scoring (RPS) System.

Morris Companies, based in Rutherford, N.J., is developing a 337,000 square-foot facility at a cost of $50 million. Scarinci Hollenbeck’s <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use-law/"" name=""This leads to the Scarinci Hollenbeck Environmental and Land Use Law Practice Page"">Industrial Site Remediation </a>practice group attorneys have headed the project’s development team.

Baker Scarinci Hollenbeck profile page"">William A. Baker</a> are managing all the regulatory affairs of the project. The team secured regulatory permits and approvals in numerous areas and intertwined them with the financing requirements of the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Trust.

The complex remediation strategies for this project required regulatory approvals for dealing with sophisticated soil and groundwater contamination issues at this former heavy industrial urban property.  The site dates back to the late 18<sup>th</sup> century and is located adjacent to a major waterway, thus requiring integrating remediation with the project’s development components. This included engineering and institutional controls, waterfront development and State land use issues, demolition of structures and attendant concerns, and local land use approvals. The Scarinci Hollenbeck team will continue its involvement with the project’s remediation strategies and development until these activities are completed.

Mr. Schwartz, who specializes in redevelopment of Brownfield sites, said, “In my over forty seven years practicing environmental law, this was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects with which I’ve been involved. This small 17 acre parcel of land contained every environmental issue seen in New Jersey, and we had the task of interweaving all of the components together, to work harmoniously.”

He added, “We are so fortunate to be working closely with the Morris Companies, a very sophisticated, dedicated, and savvy redeveloper of Brownfield sites. We will continue our involvement in the implementation of the remediation strategies to successfully complete the project.”

5511,"Appellate Court Confirms BPU Decision Terminating Sub-metering Pilot Program","For years, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) has maintained a policy against sub-metering -- the practice of occupants in a multiple dwelling unit (MDU) building subdividing electric utility bills on the customer side of the meter.  Sub-metering is accomplished by installing private metering devices; the MDU property owner remains the customer of record with the utility provider.  In 2005, however, at the request of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA), the BPU was persuaded to explore a sub-metering pilot program.  The terms of that program were set out in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated December 6, 2005, by and between the BPU and NJHMFA.

In its Order approving the pilot program, the BPU nevertheless emphasized that it remained committed to its long-standing policy prohibiting sub-metering in MDU housing.

Thereafter, two MDU complex owners -- Marine View Housing Company I (Marine View), in Hoboken, and Union Plaza Associates, L.P. (Union Plaza), in Union City, were approved by NJHMFA for participation in the sub-metering pilot program.  On that basis, Marine View spent $255,000.00 to install sub-metering equipment at its MDU complex, and Union Plaza spent $212,500.00 to install equipment at its property.

<a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SubMetering1.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-5514"" title=""SubMetering"" alt="""" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SubMetering1-200x300.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a>Upon notice of the program, opposition by the tenants was immediate, fueled by concerns over anticipated exorbitant utility charges.  Indeed, so great was the protest at Union Plaza, along with legal action by its tenants, that the project was never implemented.

Several meetings were held in 2009 among the parties and on October 28, 2009, the BPU issued an Order directing that NJHMFA, Marine View and Union Plaza show cause why the sub-metering pilot program should not be suspended.  Following the submission of comments, the BPU issued a formal Order on December 10, 2009, suspending the sub-metering pilot program.

Marine View and Union Plaza subsequently appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey.  They argued that the BPU decision to terminate the pilot program was unfair, capricious and unreasonable.  They also asserted that it was not based upon competent evidence and that it deprived them of their property without due process of law.  They noted that they had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars retrofitting their properties so as to be able to participate in the sub-metering pilot program, “with the reasonable expectation that it would receive a fair and impartial evaluation.”  Instead, they claimed, the program was terminated “after [the BPU] succumbed to political pressure exerted by local politicians and tenants’ advocacy groups.”

The Appellate Court rejected these arguments and dismissed the appeal for failure to present a justiciable issue.  It noted that the MOU expressly stated that the sub-metering pilot program was a “pilot, experimental undertaking … with no assurance of continuance.”  As a result, the Court held, “Appellants were clearly on notice that any funds used to retrofit their properties to accommodate the sub-metering pilot program were spent at the risk that the program would not be approved by the BPU for continuation. … Appellants understood and assumed the risks involved in this pilot program.”",,20120920,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/just-in/appellate-court-confirms-bpu-decision-terminating-sub-metering-pilot-program/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SubMetering11.jpg,"Images of Workers",,,"Workers in hard hats, Scarinci Hollenbeck",,"Firm News>Just In|Firm News>Legal Updates","BPU Decision|Marine View Housing|NJ Law|NJBPU|NJHMFA|Scarinci Hollenbeck|sub metering pilot program",publish,6,appellate-court-confirms-bpu-decision-terminating-sub-metering-pilot-program,,,0,0,open,closed
5523,"BPU ORDERS JCP&L TO FILE PETITION SEEKING RATE REVIEW","In an unusual move – indeed, believed to be the first time ever – the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU” or “Board”) has issued an Order directing a public utility to file a base rate case petition so that the BPU can determine whether the company’s rates for electric service are just and reasonable.

The proceeding was initiated at the instance of the Division of Rate Counsel (“Rate Counsel”), which filed a petition asserting that, based upon publicly available data, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. (“JCP&amp;L” or “Company”) is earning an unreasonable rate of return. Noting that more than six years had elapsed since the Company’s last base rate case, Rate Counsel contended that a new rate proceeding would help ensure that JCP&amp;L makes needed capital investments so as to allow it to provide safe, adequate and proper service. Rate Counsel also requested that the Board direct JCP&amp;L to utilize a 2010 historical test year in its rate case.

<a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jcpl.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-5525"" title=""jcpl"" alt="""" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jcpl-200x300.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a>In response, JCP&amp;L argued that Rate Counsel had failed to demonstrate that the Company’s rates were unjust and unreasonable and that Rate Counsel had not provided sufficient reason for the Board to order JCP&amp;L to file a base rate case at this time. JCP&amp;L also asserted that Rate Counsel’s analysis was flawed and that it inappropriately focused on the Company’s overall rate of return (“ROR”) rather than its achieved return on equity (“ROE”), which the Company maintained is the primary factor considered in base rate cases.

Rate Counsel utilized data from JCP&amp;L’s filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, concluding that the Company has exceeded its allowed ROR of 8.5%, as established in JCP&amp;L’s last base rate case. It also argued that data relied upon by JCP&amp;L were “flawed” and “unsupported.” It further posited that JCP&amp;L’s “history of reliability problems warrant[ed] a base rate case review of the Company’s captial spending and investments.”

In turn, JCP&amp;L argued that the data utilized by Rate Counsel were improper. JCP&amp;L argued that the Board should examine data based upon the Company’s 2012 budget, adjusted for a revised sales forecast and for known, actual results through March 31, 2012, including weather-adjusted revenues and pro forma and post-test year adjustments. Its ROE, which, according to JCP&amp;L, is the proper matrix upon which the Board should base its decision, was 10.1% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2011, a rate within a “zone of reasonableness.” Using the same methodology, JCP&amp;L stated that for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, its ROE dropped to 9.29%

JCP&amp;L also argued that Rate Counsel’s filing utilized “stale” 2010 data and that it “contain[ed] numerous manifest errors.” It argued that “using 2010 data to determine whether a utility’s rates are just and reasonable in 2012 would be akin to retroactive ratemaking.” JCP&amp;L similarly argued that Rate Counsel’s petition “failed to make standard ratemaking adjustments.” In contrast, JCP&amp;L claimed that its own analysis was “conservative,” as it included many ratemaking adjustments with which the Company disagreed and which it would not necessarily include in a rate filing, but which it believed Rate Counsel and Board Staff usually proposed. JCP&amp;L contended that its analysis “on the ‘whole demonstrates that JCP&amp;L’s rates are within the zone of reasonableness and there is no need for a base rate proceeding.’” Indeed, JCP&amp;L pointed out that its rates have decreased “significantly” since 2002 and that they are the lowest electric rates among the four New Jersey electric distribution companies (“EDCs”).

JCP&amp;L further argued that the fact that it had not filed a base rate case for several years should not be a reason to order that a new case be filed. It maintained that no legal or regulatory precedent or factual basis correlates the length of term between rate cases with the reasonableness of a utility’s base rates, and that the Company should not be penalized for effectively managing its business so as to avoid the need for frequent base rate cases. Similarly, JCP&amp;L contended that the length of time since the filing of the Company’s last base rate case has not affected its system-wide reliability. It argued that its Annual System Performance Reports have shown an overall positive trend since 2002. Moreover, the Company contended that “it has improved system reliability since its last base rate case and that recent reliability investigations do not warrant a forced base rate case filing.”

Conceding that no reported cases exist regarding the burden of proof where a third party challenges Board-approved rates, JCP&amp;L pointed to federal law as instructive, arguing that under the Federal Power Act, the burden of proof is on either the tribunal or the complainant “to establish that the current rate is unjust and unreasonable.”

An intervenor in the case, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation (“Gerdau”), contended that there was no dispute as to the Board’s legal authority to issue an order directing the initiation of a base rate case and that, because material issues exist with regard to JCP&amp;L’s current earnings, revenue requirements and the appropriate level of an allowed return, such an order should be issued. Gerdau also asserted that the Board should examine the “continuing justness and reasonableness of the cost allocation and rate design of JCP&amp;L’s distribution rates.” Gerdau also contended that JCP&amp;L’s comparison of its rates to other EDCs was irrelevant to the Board’s determination as to whether JCP&amp;L’s revenues are in line with its actual costs.

Also participating in the case was AARP. Contending that JCP&amp;L should be forced to file a base rate case, AARP asserted that ratepayers should not have to rely solely on a company’s desire to initiate such a proceeding in order for the Board to examine the reasonableness of its base rates.

In its decision, the Board noted its overarching mission to “ensure that regulated public utilities provide safe, adequate and proper service to the citizens of New Jersey” and that the Public Utilities Act, which vests the BPU with the power to generally supervise and regulate public utilities, should be read broadly and construed liberally. Issues involving rates, determined the Board, “must balance the interests of utility investors and ratepayers in determining what is ‘just and reasonable.’” Citing In re N.J. Power and Light Co., 9 N.J. 498, 534 (1952), the Board concluded that “[a] utility’s rate of return must fall ‘within the range of reasonableness, the zone between the lowest rate not confiscatory and the highest rate fair to the public.’” The Board analyzed the matter before it as presenting three general issues: JCP&amp;L’s earnings, the lapse of time since the Company’s last base rate case, and reliability/infrastructure issues. Given the complexity of those issues and the fact that they would very likely be inter-related, the Board found that directing JCP&amp;L to file a base rate case would be “the most efficacious method to address a number of regulatory concerns.”

As to earnings, the Board concluded that, “at this time, [it could not] properly evaluate any claims that JCP&amp;L is overearning.” It also concluded that “[a] base rate case will clarify the zone of reasonableness for this company under current economic conditions, and allow the Board to set just and reasonable rates on a prospective basis, and provide JCP&amp;L with revenues necessary to attract capital on reasonable terms.”

While determining that not filing a base rate case for a long period of time is not an indication of mismanagement, and may in fact reflect good management, the Board nevertheless determined that “an absence as long as JCP&amp;L’s” impacted the opportunity to thoroughly examine JCP&amp;L’s finances and operations.

The Board also addressed the question of JCP&amp;L’s service related issues, noting that it had determined JCP&amp;L to be deficient in certain respects with regard to storm restoration, planning and preparation. The Board did note that JCP&amp;L had committed to implementing certain recommendations presented to the Board with regard to service and facilities, but concluded that, “[g]iven the extent of reliability concerns with JCP&amp;L’s system, questions of system performance and investment would be best investigated in the context of a base rate case where the financial impact of any additional investments can be determined as an aid in decision-making.”

In sum, the Board determined that a base rate proceeding “will assure that JCP&amp;L’s rates are just and reasonable, and that the Company is investing sufficiently to assure the provision of safe, adequate and proper utility service to its customers ....”

With regard to the test year, the Board concluded that it would be appropriate for JCP&amp;L to utilize an historical test year of 2011 so as to better capture the Company’s spending patterns and capital needs. It further determined, however, that the Company should have the opportunity to establish “known and measurable” changes to the test year. The Company’s filing is due no later than November 1, 2012.",,20120927,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/uncategorized/bpu-orders-jcpl-to-file-petition-seeking-rate-review-2/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Just In|Firm News>Legal Updates|Firm News>Uncategorized","AARP|dennis linken|Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation|JCP&amp;L|NJBPU|Rate Counsel|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,6,bpu-orders-jcpl-to-file-petition-seeking-rate-review-2,,,0,0,open,closed

<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/pwkw0EUPnF4"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></div>
<strong>The income tax </strong>return information released by Governor Mitt Romney and Mrs. Romney (the “Romneys”) reveals a well-thought out strategy for transferring wealth to the next generation. Certainly, Mitt Romney was successful at Bain Capital and accumulating wealth for himself. What stands out in the eyes of tax advisors is that the Romney family trust has an estimated one hundred million dollars of assets. Regardless of your political preference, one must acknowledge the success of a plan that resulted in the transfer of such wealth.

<dl id=""attachment_5561"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 310px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""><img class="" wp-image-5561   "" title=""romney tax return"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/romney-tax-return1-300x150.png"" alt=""This is an image of Mitt Romney tax return"" width=""300"" height=""150"" /></dt></dl>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most readers are familiar with the <a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-planning-acronyms-for-the-remainder-of-2012/"" target=""_blank"">estate tax</a> but few are aware that transfers from a grandparent to a grandchild are subject to the Generation Skipping Transfer Tax (“<a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-tax-changes-in-2013-spark-more-concise-business-succession-planning/"" target=""_blank"">GST</a>”) at the highest estate tax rate in effect. Transfers out of trust to a grandchild may also be subject to the GST. Were it not for the GST, the government would not have an effective transfer-tax system, because property could be easily placed out of reach of the estate tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Due to the number of topics, this analysis is presented in [to be determined] parts, in order to cover the subject matter in detail.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I. Estate Planning </span> </strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 1995, when the Romneys began to execute their plan, they appear to have created a “<a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-issues-that-impact-your-wealth-nj-estate-planning-dynasty-trusts/"" target=""_blank"">Dynasty Trust</a>.” As we explain below, this is a device to avoid tax. At the time, the estate and gift tax exclusion was $600,000 per individual. Assuming a gift of $1.2 million in 1995, the total in the trust now is about one hundred times the initial amount. One must marvel at the total accumulated. Estate or gift taxes would have consumed almost one-half of those assets if the plan was not implemented. Instead, all of the future appreciation earned by the trust on its initial corpus escaped estate and gift tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The key is that the Romneys were willing to let go and not have every asset titled in their own names. They were willing to establish and fund a trust and to allow it to participate in good investment opportunities that were presented along the way. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to wealth transfer is the inclination of the individual to retain control. As we can see below, some measure of indirect control may be maintained, but even that is not enough control for some wealthy individuals.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>II. Dynasty Trusts</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dynasty Trusts are intended to avoid estate and GST taxes. A Dynasty Trust is designed to allow wealth to pass to two or more generations by eliminating estate (death) tax at each generation. More importantly, by shifting all future appreciation from investments to the trust early on, the Romneys avoided <a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/gifting-in-2012-strategies-for-the-reluctant-donor/"" target=""_blank"">gift tax</a> on the appreciation of the trust assets. One can imagine that this Dynasty Trust may have been an investor in the Bain Capital’s private equity or hedge funds that are, by all reports, extremely successful.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I note that it is often difficult to convince clients to transfer that big opportunity or a crown jewel of the investment portfolio to such a trust. There is a reluctance to give away assets, especially in view of the insecurity caused by the 2008 financial crisis. The tax efficiency of the Romney plan, however, cannot be denied as it has resulted in the transfer of substantial wealth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Dynasty Trust may invest in <a href=""/practices/commercial-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">real estate</a>, portfolio stocks and bonds, or in private equity. The ability of the Trust to attract opportunity, transfer wealth, and minimize risk is enhanced by the size of the assets.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>III. Private Equity / Hedge Funds/ Alternative Investments</strong></span><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1024px-Mitt_Romney_smiling.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-5545 alignright"" title=""Mitt Romney"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1024px-Mitt_Romney_smiling-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Mitt Romney Tax Returns"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Governor Mitt Romney’s affiliation with Bain Capital brought opportunities to participate in its private equity and hedge fund investments. Private equity funds are pools of capital received from investors and directed by highly skilled professionals into private businesses at different stages of development. The skill of the professional enables him to achieve a higher return through active management or oversight of the investment. Typically these investments are illiquid, locked-in for five or more years. A typical goal is to achieve capital gain for an individual investor which is taxed at a reduced rate rather than portfolio income. Although the risk is greater, the reward is also much greater than a portfolio stock.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A hedge fund actively trades in financial assets using options, forward contracts, swaps, futures, and a host of other assets in order to achieve a greater return. A hedge fund seeks to exploit anomalies in price to make a profit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One expects that the Romneys’ wealth transfer strategy called for the Dynasty Trust to participate in some of these ventures. This would explain the significant sum in the Dynasty Trust estimated to be on hand in less than 20 years of investing. One suspects that all that money was not earned in an index fund.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A reader should understand that the opportunity transferred to the trust could be real estate, a family business, or an intellectual property asset. Stock portfolios, that are managed for growth, are also suitable candidates.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>IV. Grantor Trusts</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Grantor Trust rules were enacted and <a href=""http://files.ali-aba.org/thumbs/datastorage/skoobesruoc/pdf/CL092_chapter_03_thumb.pdf"" target=""_blank"">modified</a> in the years 1924 through 1969. These rules were designed in an era when the income tax rates on trusts were significantly lower than those rates imposed on individuals. Today, the rate structure is reversed but the usefulness of these rules to assist in wealth transfer has taken on a new life. The Service has ruled that a person who is deemed a “grantor” or “owner” of the trust is responsible for income taxes as they are his or her personal obligation. The fact that a grantor is paying income tax on Dynasty Trust income is not a gift.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When you consider that the Dynasty Trust is designed not to be included in the Romneys’ estates for death tax purposes, you give them the ability to make gifts, in the form of income tax payments, that do not reduce their lifetime exclusion. This is, in effect, an unlimited increase in the estate and gift tax exclusion for those who utilize it.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>V. Estate Freezes, Discounts and Other Planning</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An estate freeze operates in a slightly different manner. An asset that is appreciating in value can be sold to family by a Self-Cancelling Installment Note (<a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-planning-acronyms-for-the-remainder-of-2012/"" target=""_blank"">SCIN</a>) or contributed to a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) in exchange for an annuity. A class of preferred interests can be created in a recapitalization similar in concept to the old preferred stock bailout. It is easy to see that value and opportunity can be transferred in this way for less than one hundred cents on the dollar.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mitt-and-fam.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-5583"" title=""mitt and fam"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mitt-and-fam-300x193.jpg"" alt=""This is an image of Mitt Romney with his family"" width=""300"" height=""193"" /></a>A great deal has been written about family limited partnerships and other closely held entities (collectively, “FLP”) and valuation discounts in the estate and gift tax area. There are numerous cases on the subject which have been covered in the <a href=""http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com"" target=""_blank"">Tax, Trust &amp; Estate News Blog</a> and elsewhere. The essence is that you would not pay full value to become a partner in an FLP if you could not freely transfer the partnership interest, readily trade it on an exchange, or force distributions or FLP liquidation. What is the value of such a partnership interest? It is certainly less than the partner’s pro rata percentage of the assets of the FLP. In contrast, if you gave a gift of IBM stock, its fair market value is easily determined. If IBM stock is owned by an FLP, the donee is not receiving stock in a public company but an interest in an entity that is not readily tradable. A former limited partner in the partnership that owned the Yankees said there was nothing more limited than being a limited partner of (the late) George Steinbrenner.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The value of these techniques for wealth accumulation on a multi-generational level is that larger blocks of assets receive professional management. Opportunities can be shifted to FLPs that trustees may be unable or unwilling to take directly. Where control needs to be centralized, it can be maintained by the senior generation in the guise of entity management. The underlying assets are still managed by the investment professionals and business people, but ownership can be transferred without upsetting or changing the structure.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>VI. Individual Retirement Accounts</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mitt Romney’s IRA provides an opportunity to accumulate ordinary income, tax free, and pass some of it to the next generation. Assume, for a moment, that Gov. Mitt Romney were to pass away. He could designate his spouse as the beneficiary, and she could elect to take Minimum Required Distributions (<a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tis-the-season-to-be-charitable/"" target=""_blank"">MRD</a>) over her lifetime. The point is that distribution of the entire account can be postponed by the unlimited estate tax marital deduction. When the account passes to a child or children after the death of the spouse, the account may be divided into separate accounts, one for each beneficiary. This would allow the child to use his or her life expectancy to calculate the MRD. The impact of the foregoing is that tax-free compounding continues net of distributions. A traditional IRA earning 6% will have more money it when the account owner is age 89 than when minimum required distributions began at age 70 ½., assuming only the MRD is taken.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bain_Capital_logo.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-5551"" title=""Bain_Capital_logo"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bain_Capital_logo.png"" alt=""Bain Capital Mitt Romney Tax Returns"" width=""213"" height=""41"" /></a>One should also note that a self-directed IRA may have been used to invest in the opportunities offered by Bain Capital. Although there are restrictions, Mitt Romney retained the right to access these investments after leaving Bain Capital, thus freeing him from these restrictions. Today, it is not uncommon for self-directed IRAs to be used by real estate and investment professionals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Roth IRAs do not require distributions to be taken and offer significant opportunity for deferral. Roth IRAs may hold non-traditional investments that are difficult to value thereby obviating the need for an appraisal each to determine the MRD each year.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>VII. Charitable Trusts</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Charitable trusts vary in type but offer unique planning opportunities, especially for highly appreciated assets. One significant benefit of a charitable trust is that it may receive a contribution of a highly appreciated asset and sell it without paying income tax. The proceeds of sale can be reinvested. When compared with the alternative of paying income tax up front, the charitable trust option results in a larger sum to invest. Annuity payments to charity are made over a period of years. Payment of the annuity over time will hopefully allow the fund to grow leaving more for the remainder beneficiaries than the alternative of a straight sale. Where the seller needs income, the seller receives the annuity and the charity receives the remainder. Although this is a superficial analysis of charitable trusts, there is much planning opportunity hidden in this thicket.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>VIII. Conclusion</strong></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One take away from the foregoing is that a great deal of wealth can be passed to the next generation if the transfer occurs before substantial appreciation occurs. A smart man learns from his own mistakes and a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. In this case, a wealthy man (or woman) may learn much from the Romneys.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Lyndhurst, N.J. October 10, 2012</strong> - Scarinci Hollenbeck tax attorneys <a href=""/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/"">Frank Brunetti</a> and <a href=""/attorneys/counsel/james-f-mcdonough-jr/"">James McDonough</a> have analyzed Presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s tax returns and have created a <a href=""/what-mitt-romneys-tax-returns-teach-us-about-accumulating-wealth/"">video and article</a> discussing how anyone can use the same advanced tax strategies for their own personal wealth preservation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Taxes are a popular topic among Americans today, and understanding the complicated U.S. Tax Code and tactics relied upon by the affluent to lower their tax liability has garnered a great deal of attention lately. The personal taxes of Mitt Romney, in particular, have sparked a lot of interest, with a particular curiosity surrounding the legal methods he uses to safeguard his money. Political affiliation and American sentiments aside, understanding the ways in which wealthy individuals meet their tax burden and adopt time-tested strategies to preserve their wealth is an important topic of discussion.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""Our tax attorneys Frank and James have done an excellent job answering Americans’ most pressing questions about Mitt Romney's tax strategies and similar courses of action used by other wealthy individuals of means,"" said Scarinci Hollenbeck Managing Partner <a href=""/attorneys/partners/donald-scarinci/"">Donald Scarinci</a>. ""Our firm is devoted to helping clients understand and implement similar legal tools to manage their wealth while meeting their federal tax obligations.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Income tax records released by Governor and Mrs. Romney detail a highly proficient use of trusts to transfer wealth amounting to roughly $100 million to the next generation. As an example, Scarinci Hollenbeck's analysis reveals that the Romneys' use of the dynasty trust to avoid estate and generation-skipping taxes is a thoroughly effective strategy that some high-net worth individuals fail to implement, resulting in lost investment and growth opportunities. A common inclination to retain control over wealth, rather than relying upon trusts to grow investments, is cited as an obstacle some affluent households face to generating more wealth and avoiding higher estate taxes. The analysis also explores Governor Romney's use of varied investments, retirement accounts and assorted trust agreements to further detail the ways in which taxes are reduced, wealth and investments appreciate, and estates remain intact.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Upcoming changes to several areas of federal tax law make understanding the complexities of the tax code system more pivotal. Scarinci Hollenbeck's <a href=""/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"">Tax, Trust and Estate Law practice</a> enables clients to take advantage of the firm's sophisticated knowledge of this subject and put themselves in a stronger position to accomplish their unique objectives.</p>

5684,"New Jersey DEP Advises Residents To Conserve Water In Aftermath Of Hurricane Sandy","<strong>From the office of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection:</strong>

<strong>TRENTON</strong> - The Department of Environmental Protection is strongly advising residents statewide to conserve water in the wake of Hurricane Sandy because widespread power outages have forced many public and private water utilities to use emergency generators to treat and pump water.

""Power companies are working hard to restore electricity to water utilities, but right now it's impossible to say how long these facilities will have to be operated on backup generators,"" Commissioner Martin said. ""Everyone must pitch in immediately and take steps to reduce water consumption.  Without conservation now, homes and businesses could find themselves without water in the near future if backup generation fails. We need full and immediate cooperation.""

The DEP is currently assessing the extent to which water utilities are currently using backup power, however it currently appears that most of the major water utilities in the state are currently using some degree of backup generation.  The DEP is in contact with water purveyors across New Jersey.

New Jersey American Water Co., the state's largest private water company, has issued a statement urging all of its customers statewide to conserve water indefinitely as many of the company's facilities are operating on emergency generators.

""We are working with the power companies to have power fully restored at all of our pumping stations and water treatment plants, and ask that our customers discontinue non-essential water use until further notice,"" said Stephen P. Schmitt, vice president of operations for New Jersey American Water. ""Voluntary water conservation reduces the demand on the water system while it operates on backup power. We thank our customers in advance for their cooperation in conserving water while power is being restored to their homes and to our facilities.""

In the aftermath of the storm, water service for New Jersey American Water customers has not been interrupted.

The DEP advises residents to adhere to the following:

*     Do not use water for any nonessential uses, such as watering of lawns and washing of cars.

*     Take showers instead of baths. Keep showers as short as possible.

*     Limit flushing of toilets, dishwashing and washing clothes.

*     Turn off the faucet when shaving and brushing teeth.

*     For those who have electrical service, run dishwashers and laundry washing machines only when they are full. If you have a water-saver cycle, use it.

*     Check your toilet, faucets, and pipes for leaks and make repairs or shut off water valves to any faucets or toilets that are leaking.

*     Use a broom or rake to clean up storm debris, including leaves or pine needles, rather than a hose.

*     Keep a supply of drinking water on hand sufficient to last several days.

5691,"New Jersey Residents To Be Alert For Local Boil Water Advisories","<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>From the office of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection:</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Christie Administration Advises Residents To Be Alert For Local Boil Water Advisories
</strong></p>
<strong>TRENTON- October 31, 2012 </strong> -- Several New Jersey municipalities have issued boil water advisories to ensure the public health and safety of state residents as a result of the effects of Hurricane Sandy.

Health Commissioner Mary O'Dowd said state, county and local officials are monitoring water quality carefully. Listen to and follow public announcements that will advise residents if and when water is safe to drink or use.

Twelve municipalities/water companies have instituted boil water advisories for all or parts of their communities:
<ul>
	<li>Atlantic City MUA</li>
	<li>New Brunswick Water Department</li>
	<li>Independence MUA - Highland System, Warren County</li>
	<li>Bayview Water System, Fortesque, Downe Township, Cumberland County</li>
	<li>Ship Bottom, Ocean County</li>
	<li>Stafford Township MUA, Cedar Bonnet Island, Ocean County</li>
	<li>United Water Sunset Ridge, Vernon Township, Sussex County</li>
	<li>United Water Highlands Lakes, Vernon Township</li>
	<li>United Water Predmore, Vernon Township</li>
	<li>United Water Sammis, Vernon Township</li>
	<li>United Water Woodridge Wantage, Sussex County</li>
	<li>Brant Beach, Ocean County</li>
</ul>
Additional information about specific boil water advisories is available at <a href=""http://readynj.posterous.com"">http://readynj.posterous.com</a>/

In case of water quality issues, water companies advise customers of the situation and detail what steps they should take. Residents who are unsure of the water system's situation in their community should check the web site of their water company or phone their offices.

""Disruptions to water supply treatment due to power outages and flooding can lead to serious health issues,"" said Commissioner O'Dowd. ""It's important that our residents continue to stay informed so they can take measures to protect themselves and their families.""

Boil water orders include disruptions to water supply treatment or delivery due to power outages and flooding caused by the storm. Additionally, damage to roadways throughout may be delaying transportation of supplies that may be needed to sustain operations.

New Jersey residents who are unsure of their water supply - from either a municipal water system or personal well - should use bottled water or boil potable water before use.

If there is evidence of a water supply problem, including cloudy or turbid water, or there has been complete loss of water service or intermittent water service, it would be advisable to boil water before consumption. Cloudy or turbid water, or complete or intermittent loss of water service could mean your water supply may be compromised with disease-causing organisms.

As a precaution, users of the potentially affected water supply are advised to bring water to a rolling boil for one minute (not including the time to bring the water to a boil) before consuming or to use commercial bottled water for consumption and food preparation.

Consumption includes brushing teeth, washing fruits and vegetables and making beverages and ice. Tap water that has not been boiled may be used for showering, bathing, shaving and washing, so long as care is taken not to swallow or allow water in the eyes or nose or mouth.

Children and disabled individuals should have their bath supervised to ensure water in not ingested. Though the risk of illness is minimal, individuals who have recent surgical wounds, are immuno-suppressed, or have a chronic illness may want to consider using bottled water for cleansing until the concern of water quality has passed.

Businesses and non-residential sites should take steps such as posting notices at or disabling water fountains and ice machines during the period of concern over the water quality. If water is provided to visitors or employees, use of commercially produced bottled water for drinking and beverage preparation, such as for coffee, is appropriate. Food service and health care operations have additional requirements from their regulatory agency.

Here are some tips regarding water safety during and after and emergency event:
<ul>
	<li>Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. Boil the water for one minute, let it cool, and store it in clean containers with covers.</li>
	<li>If you can't boil water, you can disinfect it using household bleach. Bleach will kill some, but not all, types of disease-causing organisms that may be in the water.</li>
	<li>If water is cloudy, filter it through clean cloths or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear water for disinfection.</li>
	<li>Add 1/8 teaspoon (or 8 drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household bleach per each gallon of water. Stir it well and let it stand for at least 30 minutes before you use it.</li>
	<li>Store disinfected water in clean containers with covers.</li>
	<li>If you have a well that has been flooded, the water should be tested and disinfected after flood waters recede. If you suspect your well may be contaminated, contact your local or state health department or agriculture extension agent for specific advice.</li>

5736,"NJ Environmental Protection Advisory To Limit Polluting Runoff","<h2>From the Office of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection:</h2>

<strong>TRENTON - November 6, 2012</strong> - Residents and <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com"" target=""_blank"" name=""This will direct the user to the Scarinci Hollenbeck Business Law Blog"">businesses</a> in the 38 towns served by the Middlesex County Utilities Authority's <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use-law/"" target=""_blank"" name=""Sends the user to the environmental and land use Scarinci Hollenbeck law practice page"">wastewater treatment system</a> are advised to further minimize water use to reduce stress on the storm-damaged sewage treatment system and help limit polluting effluent now flowing into the Raritan River and Raritan Bay.

The MCUA, which serves 797,000 customers in Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties, is working closely with the state Department of Environmental Protection, federal Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to repair pump station damage caused by severe flooding that is currently limiting treatment to all but about 25 percent of the system's customers.

""While the Governor already has issued an executive order calling for mandatory water use restrictions, we are asking MCUA customers to be extra diligent in conserving water to slow the flow of effluents into the river and bay, and limit environmental impacts '' said DEP Commissioner Bob Martin.

The MCUA's treatment plant is fully operational but two of its three pump stations, which normally handle 110 million gallons of wastewater daily, are not working, so wastewater is not being shipped to the treatment facility. The result is the discharge of untreated sewage into the waterways.

About 3 million gallons a day is being processed through the MCUA's South Amboy pump station. It is anticipated that the Edison pump station, which processes about 20 million gallons a day, will be on line later this week.

The MCUA's main pump station, the Sayreville station, is currently off line but has a temporary bypass pump system in place to handle about 20 million gallons a day. It normally processes 75 million gallons daily. All electrical equipment at the Sayreville facility, including pumps, motors and electric control are being disassembled, dried, tested and reassembled.

The following towns are served by the MCUA: Bound Brook, Bridgewater, Carteret, Cranbury, Dunellen, East Brunswick, Edison, Fanwood, Franklin Township, Green Brook, Helmetta, Highland Park, Jamesburg, Metuchen, Middlesex Borough, Milltown, Monroe Township, New Brunswick, North Brunswick, North Plainfield, Old Bridge, Perth Amboy, Piscataway, Plainfield, Sayreville, Scotch Plains, South Amboy, South Bound Brook, South Brunswick, South Plainfield, South River, Spotswood, Warren Township, Watchung and Woodbridge.

The Governor's Administrative Order on water use includes the following statewide water use restrictions, prohibitions and exemptions:
<ul>
	<li>All indoor water use, including showers, baths, toilet flushing, and domestic cleaning, must be conducted with minimum amounts of water;</li>
	<li>Non-essential outdoor water use is prohibited;</li>
	<li>Watering of grass, lawns and landscapes is prohibited except for newly sodded or seeded areas done by professional landscapers or immediately following a commercial application of fertilizer, pesticide or herbicides; minimum amount of water should be used during these applications;</li>
	<li>Use of water for washing paved surfaces, such as streets, sidewalks, driveways, garages, parking lots and patios is prohibited;</li>
	<li>Outdoor use of water for ornamental or aesthetic purposes, including fountains, artificial waterfalls, and reflecting pools is prohibited, except to preserve or support wildlife</li>
	<li>Use of water for municipal street sweeping is allowed only with non-potable water and with minimal use necessary;</li>
	<li>Use of water for power washing of buildings is prohibited except for commercial enterprises engaged in power washing, and with minimum water use;</li>
	<li>Car and truck washing, except for emergency vehicles, is prohibited;</li>
	<li>Commercial car washing is allowed but with reduced rinse cycles and use of recycled water for pre-rinsing of vehicles;</li>
	<li>Cars and trucks at dealerships may only be washed just prior to delivery, with wash time limited to three minutes;</li>
	<li>Serving of water in restaurants, clubs, or other eating establishments is prohibited unless specifically requested by patrons.</li>

5751,"Christie Pledges To Reduce Hurricane Sandy Debris","<em>From the offices of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection: Released, Friday, November 23rd</em>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">DEP COMMISSIONER MARTIN SAYS DEBRIS REMOVAL IS A DEPARTMENT PRIORITY</h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>TRENTON</strong>, November 23, 2012- The Christie Administration is making the safe removal of debris a top priority, working hard with communities to remove these materials to landfills, incinerators and recycling facilities as quickly as possible so that residents can begin to rebuild, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin said today.

""The scope of the devastation the storm inflicted on New Jersey is unprecedented,"" Commissioner Martin said.  ""Our number one goal is to safely remove debris from the streets of our storm-ravaged cities and towns. We are working diligently, in cooperation with cities, towns and counties, plus haulers and disposal facilities to make sure we haul away debris as quickly and efficiently as possible.""

The storm has left millions of cubic yards of materials that need to be hauled away. So far, the DEP has approved 100 temporary debris management areas to help ensure a steady flow of debris from communities that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy.

These temporary debris management areas have been established in a variety of locations, including parking lots, municipal public works yards, former landfills, and empty fields, to name some.  Local staging areas allow municipalities to get debris off the streets quickly, reducing health and safety concerns and improving access to these communities. They are located from Bergen County to Atlantic County. The majority are in Monmouth and Ocean counties.

""I commend the tremendous efforts by officials in our municipalities who, in the face of staggering challenges brought on by the storm, immediately recognized the importance of clearing debris from communities as one of the first steps toward helping their residents and businesses recover from Sandy,"" Commissioner Martin said.

Even before the storm hit, the DEP set in motion the framework for a system of temporary debris management areas for the staging and source separation of materials for proper disposal and recycling.

The DEP is also working with the Treasury Department to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of contractors available to work with local governments to haul away debris and has issued hundreds of temporary vehicle registrations to vehicles to increase waste-hauling capacity. In addition, the state has hired contractors to monitor the waste flow and ensure that it is managed properly.

Among the steps taken by the DEP to manage storm debris include:
<ul>
	<li>Expediting the review of applications for local debris staging areas;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Engaging with municipalities and counties, as well as representatives of New Jersey's solid waste and recycling industries, to evaluate ongoing and anticipated solid waste and recycling demands to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the system to handle storm debris;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Authorizing state, county and municipal entities and permitted solid waste facilities in the state to obtain temporary DEP registrations for commercial vehicles and equipment to be used in hauling storm waste;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Issuing a statewide enforcement alert noting that illegal dumping will be subject to mandatory fines and possible vehicle forfeiture.

In addition, the DEP has assigned staff to work with storm-affected municipalities one-on-one, serving as liaisons to help them work through any concerns, advise them on the availability of resources, and ensure the cleanup proceeds smoothly.

These experts are helping to prioritize which towns need the most assistance in moving debris. They are also helping municipalities work through the FEMA reimbursement process.

DEP inspectors and local authorities are closely monitoring storm debris removal to ensure protection of the environment and public health. Activities such as illegal dumping, hauling without proper approval, and price-gouging will not be tolerated. Violators will be prosecuted.

A list of solid waste facilities and operating hours as well as various DEP actions and guidance documents related to debris management may be found at: <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/dep/special/hurricane-sandy/debris.htm"">www.nj.gov/dep/special/hurricane-sandy/debris.htm</a>

6528,"Headen v. Jersey City Board of Education Success","<h2>Scarinci Hollenbeck Successful In New Jersey Supreme Court Case Headen v. Jersey City Board of Education</h2>
<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, November 15, 2012</strong> – In <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Headen v. Jersey City Board of Education</span> the <a href=""http://www.scarincilawyer.com/"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> affirmed the trial court and appellate decisions which granted summary judgment to Scarinci Hollenbeck’s client the Jersey City Board of Education.

The plaintiff was a full time ten month employee of the school district. She alleged that she was entitled to vacation pay over and above the time off that she received for winter and spring break pursuant to the <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">Civil Service Act</a>. The Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Service Act applied to ten month only employees, but that the school district could direct that the vacation time be taken during winter break, spring break, and the two day teachers’ convention for which she had been paid. Accordingly, the case was dismissed, because the plaintiff received the amount of paid vacation mandated by the Civil Service Act and was not entitled to more.

The case was argued by Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner <a href=""/attorneys/partners/robert-e-levy/"">Robert E. Levy</a>, who is Chair of the law firm’s litigation group.  According to Mr. Levy, “Had the Supreme Court ruled otherwise, the financial implications for the Jersey City Board of Education would have been substantial, because the action was brought as a class action for all similarly situated employees of the Jersey City Board of Education.”

Also participating in the case were Scarinci Hollenbeck attorneys <a href=""/attorneys/counsel/charles-h-friedrich-iii/"">Charles H. Friedrich</a> and CJ Griffin.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Lyndhurst, NJ, May 1, 2013</b> - Scarinci Hollenbeck is pleased to announce the formation of a new legal practice group as part of its ongoing strategic plan to integrate new legal specialties that address clients’ changing legal needs – <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-data-protection/"">Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection</a>. The Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection group, headed by Scarinci Hollenbeck partner and industry pioneer <a href=""/attorneys/partners/fernando-m-pinguelo/"">Fernando M. Pinguelo</a>, expands the firm’s <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/crisis-management/"">Crisis Management</a> offerings to effectively address client emergencies. “The experience and professionalism Fernando Pinguelo brings to this firm with this newly formed group continues our commitment to offer services that were previously only available to clients of boutique and larger national law firms,” said <a href=""/attorneys/partners/donald-scarinci/"">Donald Scarinci</a>, Managing Partner of the firm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cyber Crime is a dangerous aspect of the Internet Age and one that individuals, businesses, and government agencies must effectively counteract. Becoming the victim of a data security breach can leave companies open to costly ramifications and reputational damage. As technology advances, people and criminal enterprises find innovative ways to illegally access and use private and proprietary information. The cost of these attacks to the global economy is estimated to exceed $1.5 trillion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Scarinci Hollenbeck recognizes the inherent risks that come with technological innovation and the Internet Age as a whole. Pinguelo and his interdisciplinary team of professionals assembled in creating the Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection group will represent individuals, mid-sized businesses, large corporations, and government agencies in developing crisis management strategies by implementing data breach response programs and assist clients in understanding and complying with the web of international, national, state, and local laws and standards that regulate the collection, use, sharing, and protection of personal data.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The group works closely with <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com"">business executives</a>, in-house counsel, as well as HR and IT managers to develop strategies for managing business and legal issues relating to electronic data. The group focuses client attention on preventing claims and pursues strategies that enhance a client’s ability to manage data-essential precautions because of the financial and public relations fallout that often result from high-profile data breaches.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Our Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection Group is prepared to assist clients with the coordination of criminal and civil responses following a data breach. Businesses have a responsibility to shareholders, employees, and customers to safeguard proprietary, confidential, and trade-secret information,” explained Pinguelo. He continued, “Our local access to federal and state authorities and a global alliance of legal and technical professionals enable our team to address the most urgent of client needs.”</p>

Levy</a> and the <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">litigation group</a> that he chairs for their successful resolution of the highly contested case involving the Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund (HSRF) and the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.

In this well publicized case, Robert E. Levy negotiated a complete settlement, resulting in no finding of liability against HSRF or its principals. The New Jersey Attorney General's complaint had requested severe and penal injunctive relief against the defendants. However, the resulting settlement permits the HSRD principals to participate in the distribution of charitable funds to needy New York and New Jersey area recipients whose lives had been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. The agreement required some voluntary restrictions on the defendants, but Scarinci Hollenbeck was able to ensure that any monetary penalties were stayed and would thereafter be vacated following compliance with the agreed restrictions.

While the Appellate Division invalidated NJDEP’s regulation that a property be free from contamination as a condition to receiving an ISRA DQE, it remanded the case to NJDEP for further consideration of whether Des Champs’, qualified for an ISRA DQE, and R&amp;K’s arguments.  NJDEP, instead of holding a remand proceeding, and despite R&amp;K’s request to be included in one, went ahead and issued the ISRA DQE to Des Champs without affording R&amp;K an opportunity to participate and be heard. The Court ruled that NJDEP acted “arbitrarily and capriciously by shutting out R&amp;K from the remand process.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Appellate Division reversed NJDEP’s issuance of an ISRA DQE to Des Champs, and directed that NJDEP hold a remand proceeding to consider the facts supporting Des Champs’ ISRA DQE application including the possible initiation of an Office of Administrative Law (OAL) proceeding.</p>",,20130522,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/just-in/environmental-attorneys-successful-in-superior-court-appeal/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Congratulations|Firm News>Just In","industrial property|ISRA|New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|NJDEP",publish,10,environmental-attorneys-successful-in-superior-court-appeal,,,0,0,open,closed

New Jersey Supreme Court Decision.</h3>

<strong>Lyndhurst, New Jersey, August 7, 2013:</strong> Scarinci Hollenbeck is pleased to announce that the firm’s litigation department, lead by Co-Chair and Partner <a href=""/attorneys/partners/joel-n-kreizman/"">Joel N. Kreizman</a>, successfully achieved a unanimous decision in <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hirsch-v-Amper-Financial-Services-Opinion.pdf"">Hirsch v Amper Financial Services Opinion</a>, from the New Jersey Supreme Court today, on behalf of clients Michael and Robyn Hirsch.

This morning, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision reversing both the Trial Court’s and the Appellate Division’s determinations that the Hirschs were required to submit their claims against the defendants, Amper Financial Services, LLC and EisnerAmper LLP, to an arbitration panel instead of a jury.
<blockquote style=""font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px;"">This decision to allow a person or entity to maintain the right to a jury trial marks a strong precedent in New Jersey for future arbitrated cases.</blockquote>
The Hirschs had invested $3.4 million with Amper Financial Services LLC, the investment arm of the EisnerAmper accounting firm. The investments were to be handled conservatively. Instead, $550,000 was placed into securitized notes issued by Medical Provider Financial Corporation (Med Cap). Med Cap was later deemed to be a Ponzi scheme and closed by the SEC. The Hirschs lost their entire $550,000 investment.

Amper Financial utilized Securities America, Inc. (SAI), as the broker to purchase the notes. The Hirschs were required to sign an agreement with SAI, which contained a clause stating that any disputes between the Hirschs and SAI were to be arbitrated.

When the Hirschs lost their investment, they brought an arbitration claim against SAI, but sought a jury trial against Amper Financial and EisnerAmper. The Hirschs filed a claim against the Amper entities arguing that charging a fee based on the amount of money under management, as well as receiving commission from SAI, constitutes a breach of fiduciary duties. This is also a violation of New Jersey Securities Law.

Further, the claim states that the Amper entities were paid to perform independent research on their financial investments, but instead sought advice solely from SAI. However, the Trial Court and the Appellate Division ruled that the Hirschs’ claims against the Amper entities had to be presented in the same arbitration as those against SAI. Today, the Supreme Court reversed those rulings, disagreeing with the rationale used by the lower courts to require arbitration.

The Hirschs’ claims will now be presented in public to a jury instead of a closed and private arbitration. This decision is strong precedent that non-signatories to an arbitration agreement may not be denied access to the courts except in very limited circumstances. That right and the right to a jury trial may not be abrogated unless explicitly waived.",,20130807,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/just-in/supreme-courts-unanimous-decision-reverses-appellate-division-ruling/,,,,,,,"Firm News>Congratulations|Firm News>Just In|Firm News>Legal Updates","joel n kreizman|new jersey supreme court|right to jury trial|scarinci hollenbeck litigation department",publish,10,supreme-courts-unanimous-decision-reverses-appellate-division-ruling,,,0,0,open,closed

7091,"APPELLATE COURT REVERSES BPU DECISION APPROVING SALE OF UTILITY PROPERTY","In a recent opinion, the <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/37-2-0682-In-TMO-The-Petition-of-Atlantic-City-Electric-Company.pdf"">Appellate Division reversed a decision</a> by the majority of the Commissioners of the Board of Public Utilities (Board or BPU) approving the sale by Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) of property no longer used by ACE in the provision of electric service.

The case had its inception in 1999, when ACE determined to sell the property located in Cumberland County. The primary bidders consisted of land developers and the State Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). DEP’s initial offer was significantly lower than that of the developers and was conditioned on a requirement of good title, but it was an all-cash transaction. In contrast, the developers’ offer was financed and in part contingent upon a determination to continue following an inspection period.

In Ja<a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/appellate-court-reverses-bpu-decision-approving-sale-of-utility-property"" rel=""attachment wp-att-7093""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7093 alignright"" style=""margin-left: 15px;"" alt=""Commissioners of the Board of Public Utilities"" src=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Commissioners-of-the-Board-of-Public-Utilities.jpg"" width=""520"" height=""347"" /></a>nuary 2002, ACE and the developers entered into a written agreement for the sale of the property. The developers’ plans included the construction of an age-restricted residential development and a golf course, with much of the property remaining undeveloped. In May 2002, ACE petitioned the BPU for approval of the sale. At a public hearing convened by the BPU, representatives of ACE and members of local government testified in favor of the sale, while others opposed the sale largely on environmental grounds. In support of its request, ACE noted the projected increase in new tax ratables and the attraction of residents who would not adversely impact the school system. Those favoring the sale recognized the “<a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use-law/"">environmentally sensitive</a> nature of the area, but believed [the] developers’ general development plan … appropriately addressed those concerns.…”

Opposing the developers’ purchase, several environmental groups and local residents also testified, stressing the impact of the proposed development on the environment. One opponent, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), presented a witness who offered an economic analysis of the proposed sale. PIRG contended that a simple comparison of the face value of the offers was insufficient and that a proper analysis should factor in the relative risk and consider the net present value (NPV) of the offers. On that basis, PIRG argued that the DEP offer was actually superior to that of the developers.

Following the public hearing, the DEP increased its offer, again on an all-cash basis with no financial contingencies nor for the need for any developmental approvals.

During the BPU proceeding, ACE presented its own economic analysis, contending that the PIRG report utilized unwarranted assumptions. Factoring in proper adjustments, contended ACE, resulted in the conclusion that the developers’ offer, even on the basis of NPV (as distinct from face value), exceeded that of the DEP.

The local planning board approved the developers’ plan, which was thereafter challenged by several environmental organizations. During the course of the planning board proceedings, as well as an appeal regarding same, the BPU stayed its consideration of ACE’s petition. Following the Appellate Court’s 2007 affirmation of the planning board’s approval, ACE filed a motion before the BPU seeking expedited treatment of its petition.
<blockquote>the ultimate question centers on whether or not the BPU should approve the sale to the developer[s].</blockquote>
The BPU deemed the matter a “contested case” and on April 14, 2009, issued a pre-hearing order in which it determined that “the ultimate question centers on whether or not the BPU should approve the sale to the developer[s].” The prehearing order established a schedule permitting the parties to submit property appraisals and updated economic analyses regarding the offers. On March 23, 2009, the DEP further increased its offer, but shortly thereafter ACE rejected such offer on the basis that the property was already under contract with the developers. Supplemental reports, including economic analyses of the offers, were submitted by ACE, DEP and the environmental group interveners.

Thereafter, the Board designated BPU President Jeanne M. Fox as the presiding Commissioner at a hearing subsequently conducted on September 23, 2009. The witnesses at the hearing were the economic consultants retained by the developers, DEP and the environmental group intervenors. The New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (Rate Counsel) also participated in the proceeding and opposed the sale to the developers, favoring instead the DEP offer.

On April 14, 2010, a majority of the BPU Commissioners approved ACE’s petition for authorization to sell the property to the developers. The BPU’s decision was memorialized in an Order dated June 21, 2010. Commissioner Fox, in a separate opinion, dissented.

The majority’s position was premised on its conclusion that ACE had reviewed the offers before it in 2002 and that ACE, utilizing its best business judgment, had concluded that the developers’ offer was best: “… [T]he final consideration is that, except in rare situations, the Board is hesitant to replace a valid and reasonable business judgment of a utility with its own business judgment.… In this particular ‘battle of the experts,’ with each party providing different and conflicting discount rates [regarding the NPV of the offers], the Board is inclined to accept the judgment of the party that has the most financial stake in the decision and the most desire to maximize financial benefit––and that is ACE.”

As to the issues raised by the environmental group intervenors, the majority recognized environmental issues to be a “major … question of … public interest,” but concluded that the BPU lacked “the ability or authority to place environmental issues above utility issues.”

The majority also concluded that the Board’s review should be limited to the facts as they existed in 2002, not as modified by events occurring through 2009. Notwithstanding economic changes between 2002 and 2009, the Board noted that ACE was “willing to accept the 2002 offer despite the delay … [and that] it is not the Board’s role to second-guess that decision.”

Commissioner Fox disagreed, concluding that the BPU should not simply defer to the business judgment of ACE but rather that the BPU has an affirmative obligation to review the transaction. The Commissioner further concluded that the DEP and the environmental groups’ expert witnesses were more credible, based upon “stronger credentials and experience directly related to the specific factors involved in this particular transaction[,]” and she adopted their analysis of the risk factors inherent in the developers’ agreement. In addition, Commissioner Fox opined that intervening economic conditions should be taken into consideration.

The environmental group intervenors and Rate Counsel appealed. In its decision, the appellate court noted its limited judicial capacity to review administrative decisions, particularly given the presumptive validity accorded such rulings. The court also noted that the BPU is endowed with “broad powers” to regulate public utilities. Nevertheless, the court agreed with Commissioner Fox, concluding that “[t]he majority’s deferral to ACE’s ‘business judgment’ … ignored the Legislature’s delegation of authority to the BPU in N.J.S.A. 48:3-7a.” The BPU was required, the court held, to make explicit findings of fact regarding its determination.

The court also agreed with Commissioner Fox in concluding that the BPU was required to consider economic conditions between 2002 and 2009 impacting the sale. On that basis, the court concluded that disregarding the majority of the financial evidence contained in the record “limited [the BPU’s] ability to undertake a meaningful statutorily mandated review.”

Notwithstanding the BPU order in mid-2010, none of the opposing intervenors nor the DEP had moved for a stay of the order at any time. Thus, on October 8, 2010, ACE and the developers consummated the transaction. On appeal, the developers therefore argued that the appeal was moot. The court noted, however, that the New Jersey Supreme Court has held that consummation of a transaction during the pendency of an appeal does not render the appeal moot and that where circumstances “equitably call for such action the court may order the [transaction] undone.” The Appellate Division observed that the sale is voidable if “[the] BPU failed to perform a meaningful review of the petition as required by the statute[,]” and that “this case involves an important matter of public interest.” As a result, and notwithstanding the fact that the fact that the transaction had already closed, the court determined that the BPU’s majority decision lacked foundation and that the case should be reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I have been privileged to be involved in Constitutional issues on behalf of my clients since the beginning of my career as a lawyer,” said <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/donald-scarinci/"">Donald Scarinci</a>, Managing Partner of Scarinci Hollenbeck and Editor of the Constitutional Law Reporter. “My passion for Constitutional law deepened further when I researched and wrote the Biography of David Brearley, a signer of the Constitution from the State of New Jersey and the first Federal District Court Judge from this state. I hope this website generates the same enthusiasm in others that I have for the subject.”</p>

Its interactive United States Constitution is unlike anything else on the web. The full text of the Constitution is placed alongside of a plain language translation written by Cathy Travis and reprinted with permission. The creative use of hyperlinks allows the reader to peel back the document in order to reveal its complexities in an easy and rewarding way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The website includes a blog that is updated once a week with articles pertaining to case law or current events. There is also an external news feed that links to the very best articles from law professors, scholars, and news writers, making the site a valuable destination for people who want to stay current and informed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to the news feed and the annotated Constitution, the website features an easy-to-navigate listing of U.S. Supreme Court cases, which includes the formal court ruling, the author of the majority opinion, and a separate analysis of the case. The latter provides readers with a succinct overview of the proceedings, as well as the key points of the case and the potential implications of the ruling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, the website features short biographies of the current Supreme Court Justices as well as those of all former Chief Justices dating back to the very first Supreme Court Justice, John Jay, who was appointed in 1789.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Scarinci Hollenbeck has dedicated its website and various blogs to keeping viewers informed about pressing legal issues and educating them on the implications of landmark rulings. The law firm's devotion to these goals has been evidenced by previous awards it has earned from the prestigious New Media Institute. In 2012, the Institute extended to Scarinci Hollenbeck the ""Standard of Excellence"" award for its overall main website design, interactive structure, and the creative use of social media platforms to generate a sizable readership.</p>

Mr. Caruso was requested for the multiple interviews to offer his legal insight into the recent Major League Baseball arbitration decision involving New York Yankee Slugger <a href=""http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/?s=alex+rodriguez"" target=""_blank"">Alex Rodriquez</a>, otherwise known as A-Rod.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A-rod was issued a 211-game penalty by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, following an investigation into A-rod’s use of performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension was later reduced to 162 games during Saturday’s arbitration for his part in the Biogenesis doping scandal.  The suspension is the longest in MLB history for a doping case. Rodriguez has vowed to appeal the ruling and says he will take the case to federal court. However, Anthony Caruso commented that “The standard of review by a federal court is a difficult one to overcome, and A-rod would have to demonstrate that there was a manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrator below in order for a federal judge to effectively overturn or modify that decision.”</p>

7610,"Scarinci Hollenbeck Discovers Successful Formula for Legal Marketing","<h3 style=""text-align: center;"" align=""center""><em><strong>Law Firm continues to Enhance Client and User Experience with Debut of Newest Website</strong></em></h3>
<strong>Lyndhurst, New Jersey – February 11, 2014</strong> - Scarinci Hollenbeck, a full service general practice business law firm in New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C., debuts the newest version of their website www.scarincihollenbeck.com. The new website is a total redesign, built specifically to enhance client and user experience. This is the second time in two years that the firm has unveiled a cutting edge platform in conjunction with the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce’s Annual Walk to Washington and Congressional Dinner.

The new site is fully mobile and features a flexible design for easy display on any mobile platform. With updated content and brand new interactive elements, users will be able to gain the full experience of what Scarinci Hollenbeck represents, “providing legal representation of the highest caliber at an affordable cost.”

Scarinci Hollenbeck has achieved a number of successes with its redefined marketing strategy, including two website awards issued by the <a href=""/scarinci-hollenbeck-receives-best-in-industry-award-for-pro-bono-website/"">New Media Institute</a>. The firm has also seen a monumental increase in overall site traffic since they began their new strategy in January of 2012. As of February 10, 2014, according to alexa.com, a website ranking company, Scarinci Hollenbeck’s website ranked within the top 52,000 websites in the United States. This is a significant achievement because a ranking like this is rarely obtained by law firms of Scarinci’s size, and is usually restricted to Am Law 200 firms.<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/""><img class="" wp-image-7622 aligncenter"" alt=""Scarinci Hollenbeck Attorneys at Law"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scarinci-Hollenbeck-Logo.png"" width=""600"" height=""103"" /></a>This online success has garnered a record number of leads and opportunities for new business in 2013. Peter Moeller, Director of Marketing, said “It is our goal to redefine Scarinci Hollenbeck and its attorneys as a strong regional firm in the greater New York area.” He continued, “We are competitive in every way with other regional firms, who support more costly overhead and charge higher prices”.

The Firm’s practice areas are as diverse as their marketing efforts. Since 2009, the firm has made a concerted effort to offer their clients more versatile and sophisticated practices, including <a href=""/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-corporate-transactions-and-business-law/"">ERISA Law</a>; Insurance Claims Law; Sports, Media, &amp; <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment/"">Entertainment Law</a>; and Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection Law. Managing Partner <a href=""/attorneys/donald-scarinci/"">Donald Scarinci</a> said, “We identified the changing landscape in the legal community brought by the 2008 recession, and the rise of social media and internet commerce, and we dedicated significant resources to refresh our approach.” The law firm plans to continue its growth by adding office locations in areas of brisk redevelopment such as Jersey City.  Scarinci Hollenbeck will continue strategically to identify and dominate new markets and new areas by unveiling additional, more specialized websites, blogs, videos, and tools in order to expose the firm’s service.

Scarinci Hollenbeck has announced they will be unveiling another program for business owners to join next week and invite anyone with questions to stay tuned and visit the new Scarinci Hollenbeck website at www.scarincihollenbeck.com.

Caruso, Esq."" alt=""Anthony R. Caruso Attorney"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Caruso-small.jpg"" width=""108"" height=""151"" /></a><strong>Ocean, New Jersey –February 10, 2014</strong><b> - </b>A team of lawyers at Scarinci Hollenbeck led by partner Anthony R. Caruso, Esq. won a major victory in Delaware Chancery Court recently. Vice Chancellor Glasscock ruled in favor of their clients, American Capital Acquisition Partners LLC and related individual principals as Plaintiffs, in an action against financial conglomerate LPL Financial LLC and LPL Holdings Inc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Defendants had purchased Plaintiffs’ operations in 2011.  Part of the purchase price was to be paid after the acquisition based on future revenues. The lawsuit stemmed from the absence of post-closing earnings when Plaintiffs expected to accrue more revenue and felt they were precluded by Defendants from doing so.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Plaintiffs filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against Defendant LPL Financial LLC and LPL Holdings, Inc. and in New Jersey on a related action against Andrew Putterman and Fortigent LLC.  Plaintiffs assert several claims including fraud, bad faith and conspiracy against the Defendants.  Defendants immediately filed a motion attempting to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint by alleging a failure by Plaintiffs to plead a claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is an important victory for our clients, as now they will get the opportunity to prove their case in court</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Defendant LPL Holdings and Defendant LPL Financial were unsuccessful to the extent that the Court agreed with Plaintiffs and allowed two of Plaintiff’s claims to go forward to trial.  The Court held that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support the inference that Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by interfering with Plaintiffs’ ability to generate revenue, thereby preventing Plaintiffs from attaining the revenue targets sufficient to trigger payment under the contingent purchase price arrangement.  Additionally, the court sustained Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This is an important victory for our clients, as now they will get the opportunity to prove their case in court,” says lead attorney and partner on the case, <a href=""/attorneys/anthony-r-caruso-esq/"">Anthony R. Caruso</a>, Esq.  “I would like to commend my colleagues <a href=""/attorneys/charles-a-yuen/"">Charles Yuen</a>, who argued before the court, and Eleanor Grinshteyn who assisted in all aspects of the case.  We are confident that our clients will be effective in telling their story as to how they were mistreated by Defendants LPL Financial LLC and LPL Holdings Inc.  We all look forward to exposing the facts in this case.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Senior Associate <a href=""/attorneys/eleanor-grishteyn/"">Eleanor Grinshteyn</a> commented that “it is a rare and meaningful occurrence when a Delaware court allows a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim to continue.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Defendant LPL Holdings and Defendant LPL Financial are now required to file a formal answer to the active claims being asserted by Plaintiffs, and then the parties will enter the discovery period.  A decision in the related New Jersey action is expected soon.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Lyndhurst, New Jersey – March 12, 2014</strong> – CorporateINTL, a U.K. based international business magazine, has named Scarinci Hollenbeck the “Tax Law Firm of the Year in New Jersey.” CorporateINTL is a leading, monthly publication for business leaders and financiers, providing key insights and commentary on emerging markets and domestic and <a href=""/practices/international-law-trade/"">international business</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to <a href=""http://www.corp-intl.com/"" target=""_blank"">CorporateINTL</a>, it did an extensive search over a six month period, compiling nominations from over one million professionals involved in business.  The nominations were provided to a small panel of judges who made the final decision.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Scarinci Hollenbeck’s achievement is due to the combined experience and knowledge of the attorneys in its <a href=""/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"">Tax, Trusts &amp; Estates practice group</a>: Frank L. Brunetti, Partner and Chairman; James F. McDonough, Counsel and editor of the firm’s tax blog; and Partners Joseph M. Donegan and Gary S. Young.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We have positioned ourselves to be a leading tax group in New Jersey and offer clients a sophisticated tax practice rarely seen in a firm our size,” said <a href=""/attorneys/frank-l-brunetti/"">Frank Brunetti</a>. “We are honored that CorpINTL has recognized our hard work.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mr. Brunetti has his L.L.M. (Master of Laws) in taxation from New York University School of Law and has taught several graduate tax courses at Farleigh Dickinson University for the past thirty five-years. He is also an observer member of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Cooperation in International Tax and speaks annually in Geneva, Switzerland on various areas of tax law, including voluntary off shore account disclosure with the IRS. Mr. McDonough has been a corporate tax attorney for over twenty five years and has a M.L.T (Master of Laws in Taxation) from Georgetown University and his L.L.M. from Thomas Jefferson School of Law in international taxation and finance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""/attorneys/james-f-mcdonough/"">James F. McDonough</a> said, “No longer are tax issues confined by national borders. Most businesses, by necessity, engage in cross-border activity and are faced with international tax, treaty, tax credit and repatriation issues that a year ago, belonged largely to Fortune 500 companies. Even families now face cross-border income, gift, and estate issues, arising from the migration of members into and out of the U.S., be it permanent or temporary.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The group’s success has been highlighted by their popular <a href=""http://taxtrustestatenews.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tax, Trust &amp; Estate blog</a>, which provides discussions on some of the most complex areas of tax law including: retirement plan benefits, international tax, gift tax laws, and the preparation of estate taxes, trusts, and wills.</p>

In the recent Award, Arbitrator James Mastriani provided that the parties’ salary proposals were substantially different as the PBA sought a five (5)year contract with a 3% salary increase and the Township proposed a four  (4) year contract with a two (2) year salary freeze and two percent (2%) increase for the remaining years.  Upon review of the Township’s agreement with the Fire Unions, Arbitrator Mastriani conducted a thorough analysis for parity within the Township’s bargaining units.   Arbitrator Mastriani awarded a four year contract and the Township’s salary proposal of 0%, 0%, 2%, and 2%.  He also added two (2) additional steps for salary guide for new hires.  In addition, Arbitrator Mastriani awarded the PBA a $625 stipend to be paid in 2012 and 2013 so as to mirror the compensation components of the Fire Unions agreements in the most efficient manner.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In <b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DeGilio</span></b>, the PSA stated that if the ex-husband’s payments under the PSA were not timely made, his ex-wife could move to reopen alimony.  There were some late payments, but when the ex-wife moved to reopen alimony, the Court noted that at the time the motion was brought, there were no arrears and the ex-husband had almost completed making all payments.  It, thus, denied the motion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The decision in <b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DeGilio</span></b> is significant in that it reaffirms that the Family Part, as a court of equity, may apply equitable principles, and not necessarily abide by the specific wording of a matrimonial agreement.</p>

8083,"Scarinci Hollenbeck Achieves Significant Victory on Behalf of the Town of West New York","<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Attorney Sean Dias Successfully Argues Case after Order to Show Cause was Filed in Connection with Scheduling of School Board Elections. </b></h3>
[caption id=""attachment_7262"" align=""alignright"" width=""108""]<a href=""/attorneys/robert-e-levy/""><img class=""size-thumbnail wp-image-7262   "" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" alt=""Robert E.

A team of lawyers at Scarinci Hollenbeck led by partner <a href=""/attorneys/robert-e-levy/"">Robert E. Levy, Esq.</a>, chair of the litigation group and <a href=""/attorneys/sean-d-dias/"">Sean Dias, Esq.</a>, counsel, recently won a significant victory in the New Jersey Superior Court on behalf of the Town of West New York, regarding the scheduling of school board elections.  Mr. Dias argued the case on behalf of the Town.  New Jersey Superior Court Assignment Judge Peter Bariso dismissed Plaintiff’s lawsuit with prejudice and held that the Town complied with the <a href=""/practices/school-law/"">school law</a> election notice requirement set forth in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">N.J.S.A.</span> 19:60-1.1 (c).

In New Jersey, annual school elections are set by statute to occur on the third Tuesday in April.  By law, the Commissioner of Education is authorized to change the annual school election date (the third Tuesday in April) if that date coincides with “a period of religious observance.”  Due to an event in the 2014 calendar, the election date coincided with a period of religious observance.  As a result, the Commissioner of Education changed the annual school election from April 15, 2014 (the third Tuesday in April) to Wednesday, April 23, 2014.

[caption id=""attachment_7251"" align=""alignright"" width=""108""]<a href=""/attorneys/sean-d-dias/""><img class=""size-thumbnail wp-image-7251  "" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" alt=""New Jersey Public Law Attorney Sean D.

Pursuant to recent election law, the Town adopted a resolution moving the annual school election from Wednesday, April 23, 2014, to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">November</span>.  Prior to moving a school election to November, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">N.J.S.A.</span> 19:60-1.1 (c) requires that the municipality must provide “no less than 60 days” notice to the County Clerk that it has passed such a resolution.  The Town provided more than 60 days notice to the County Clerk prior to the original April 23, 2014 school election date.

Plaintiff, Francisco Ferreiro, filed an Order to Show Cause against the Town arguing that the Town failed to provide timely notice to the County Clerk.  Ferreiro argued that the 60 days notice ran from the third Tuesday in April (April 15, 2014) and not from the April 23, 2014, school election date.  Plaintiff’s requested remedy was to move the annual school election from November 2014 back to April 23, 2014.

The Town relied on the seminal New Jersey Supreme Court case of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">New Jersey Democratic Party, Inc. v. Samson</span>, 175 <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">N.J.</span> 172 (2002).  In that case, the Court set forth principles that a reviewing Court should construe the election law under review “so as to preserve the paramount right of the voters to exercise the franchise.”  Judge Bariso ruled that he was guided by and bound by New Jersey Supreme Court decisions, particularly <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">New Jersey Democratic Party, Inc. v. Samson</span> when interpreting whether there is compliance with the election law under review.  The Judge refused to apply a strict and rigid interpretation of N.J.S.A. 19:60-1.1 (c), and he held that a reasonable interpretation of the notice requirement in the statute is that the time to notify the County Clerk <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">runs from the time of the actual annual school election date</span> of April 23, 2014, and not from the third Tuesday in April of 2014.

Kreizman</a>, Partner and Co-Chair of the Litigation Group at Scarinci Hollenbeck recently published “The Applicability of Equitable Estoppel” in New Jersey Lawyer Magazine.

<em>New Jersey Lawyer Magazine </em>is an award-winning, bimonthly publication created by the New Jersey Bar Association. Each issue focuses on a certain area of substantive law and features articles written by experienced professionals.

In the April 2014 issue, Kreizman’s “The Applicability of Equitable Estoppel” discusses how Equitable Estoppel, a court created doctrine that prevents a party from “asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed…as against another person who in good faith relied upon such conduct and thereby has been led to change his position for the worse,” is often used as a defense in court and rarely used for affirmative purposes.

When an effort was made to use equitable estoppel affirmatively to compel an arbitration where no agreement to arbitrate existed, the Supreme Court in <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/supreme-courts-unanimous-decision-reverses-appellate-division-ruling/"">Hirsch v. Amper Financial</a> rejected that effort. Justice Jaynee LaVecchia, author of the opinion, wrote: “Equitable estoppel is more properly viewed as a shield to prevent injustice rather than a sword to compel arbitration.""

The Los Angeles Times is a leading source of news on Southern California, entertainment, movies, television, music, politics, business, health, technology, travel, sports, environment, economics and other topics affecting California.

Mr. Caruso discusses how companies have to zealously protect their copyrights, since the Internet has made pirating music, movies, and other forms of entertainment incredibly easy. He also shares that promoters have a legitimate right to defend their agreements, however he sympathizes with the business owner who doesn’t know what he or she is doing is wrong like “the teenager who downloads music not really knowing it’s against the law.”

8124,"Bridgegate The First Judicial Decision","The first judicial decision involving Bridgegate was issued by Superior Court Assignment Judge Mary Jacobson. It contains a compelling examination of the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination applied to the government’s subpoena for the production of documents. The <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/"" target=""_blank"">Fifth Amendment</a> protects an individual from being compelled to provide “testimonial” evidence. Ordinarily this protection does not apply to non-testimonial conduct such as producing documents subpoenaed by a <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/rights-of-criminal-defendants/#Grand"" target=""_blank"">Grand Jury</a>.  The exception discussed in the Bridgegate decision is when the “act of production” in and of itself becomes “testimonial” and therefore afforded Fifth Amendment protection.
<blockquote>The <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/"" target=""_blank"">Fifth Amendment</a> protects an individual from being compelled to provide “testimonial” evidence.</blockquote>
The New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigations (“the Committee”) issued subpoenas to William Stepien and Bridget Anne Kelly (“the defendants”) to produce documents and other information.  They refused citing their federal and state constitutional protection against self-incrimination. The Committee initiated a court action to obtain: (i) a declaratory judgment that the defendants failed to comply with the subpoenas without justification; and (ii) a court order compelling the defendants to produce the documents requested in the subpoenas.  The defendants claimed, among other arguments that the nature of the subpoenas required them to testify against themselves by the “act of production”.

This <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">area of law is complex</a> and difficult to apply. The Court noted that the procedural posture of the case was “highly unusual” making the judicial determination more challenging.  It requires a court to balance important individual rights with the investigative needs of government authorities.  The question presented was whether, because of the nature and scope of very broad subpoenas, the defendants would be testifying against themselves if they complied with the production requirements.

Ultimately the court decided that the critical analysis would involve whether the government, at the time the subpoenas were issued, knew with “reasonable particularity” of the existence of the documents sought such that the fact that the defendants’ possession of the documents and things sought could be considered “a foregone conclusion”.  If not, the production would be a “fishing expedition” and therefore “testimonial”.

The Court found that there was little evidence to support the requirement that the government knew of the existence of the items subpoenaed.  The case did not involve a subpoena requiring the defendants to merely surrender items, but rather the subpoenas were so broad that they required the defendants to discriminate among the many documents that might be possessed and then produce only those documents related to the broad subject matter being investigated.  The defendants would be attesting to the authenticity of the documents and communicating that “each produced piece of evidence in fact relates to the lane closures”.  In essence the defendants themselves would be conducting the investigation for the Committee which investigation could lead to criminal liability.  The defendants would be, in effect, “the primary informant against (themselves)”.

The Court’s decision refusing to enforce the subpoenas leaves to the Committee other remedies to conduct its investigation including re-issuing more narrowly tailored subpoenas which would require a non-testimonial response.

8204,"What are the legal ramifications of Donald Sterling's alleged racist remarks?","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unless you've had your television and Internet turned off for the past few weeks, you've likely heard about Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's alleged racist remarks brought to light by TMZ.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-vs-Donald-sterling.jpg""><img class=""alignright  wp-image-8209"" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" alt=""Donald Sterling Legal Ramifications"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-vs-Donald-sterling.jpg"" width=""510"" height=""303"" /></a>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently announced that Sterling is banned from NBA activities for life and has been fined $2.5 million for his remarks, but we're going to examine if there will be any legal ramifications in the court of law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sterling's reported comments were made on the phone with his girlfriend, which doesn't violate any laws. However, if it is found that he made similar remarks in the workplace, this could be a violation. For example, the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits <a href=""/practices/labor-employment"">employment discrimination</a> based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sterling isn't the only party that could be in the midst of a legal conundrum, as the NBA may have legal issues as well. Experts told the Los Angeles Times that the lifetime ban brought down by the league could lead to a lawsuit being filed by Sterling against the NBA. The biggest issue is that the comments were made in private.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""This is not a question about whether the comments are acceptable,"" director of the <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law"" target=""_self"">Sports Law</a> Program at Tulane University, told the LA Times. ""I think we all agree they are unacceptable and abhorrent, but the issue becomes stickier because they were not made publicly. That does not excuse the comments, but it does raise the issue of whether owners have empowered the commissioner to punish an owner for comments made in private.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">WPIX11 New York, recently interviewed me and asked me to share my legal insight on the matter. ""The NBA is a self governing privately held association as opposed to a governmental agency. Thus, a team owner like Sterling, would not have many available defenses to counter a proposed ouster vote by other team owners.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is no question this will remain a major topic of conversation in the foreseeable future, and it will be interesting to follow along and see how the legal side pans out now that Sterling has been banned from the NBA for life.</p>

<em>By Fernando M. Pinguelo and Daniel Sodroski</em>

As early as in February 2014, eBay, Inc., a multi-billion dollar company that services and manages one of the world’s largest user-to-user auction websites, had significant <a title=""PIX11 Morning Show Discusses Donald Sterling Apology with Sports Entertainment Lawyer Anthony R. Caruso"" href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">customer information stolen</a>.  Cybercriminals who gained access to the company’s internal and customer databases managed to obtain customer names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and user passwords—extremely sensitive information, to say the least.  Reportedly, credit card information and online payment information, such as one’s PayPal account, <strong>were not compromised</strong>.

<strong>On May 21, 2014</strong>, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-21/ebay-asks-users-to-change-their-passwords-after-cyber-attack.html"">eBay</a> issued a public statement, urging its users to change their passwords.  While the auction giant did not disclose how many of its 148 million registered users were affected, the eBay assured that there has yet to be any malicious activity on any eBay accounts (<i>i.e.</i>, the passwords acquired have not yet been used) and that the passwords stored in eBay’s database are encrypted and virtually impossible to decipher.  Regardless, it behooves online customers to change their passwords to prevent their accounts from being hijacked.

More interestingly, <strong>eBay discovered the breach two weeks ago</strong>.  Although not the biggest data breach in U.S. history, the company began immediate forensic proceedings to uncover the damage incurred by the cyber theft, leaving many to ponder why the eCommerce corporation delayed notice to customers and the public at large.  Accounts may be salvaged due to eBay’s<a href=""/practices/crisis-risk-management/""> crisis management strategy</a>; however, the cyber thieves still walked away with critical and private customer information.  Cyber criminals who have access to the stolen email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers may attempt to use such information to extract even more private information from eBay users.  Therefore, eBay users should be on the lookout for such unsavory attempts.

<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ebay-data-breach.png""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-8264"" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" alt=""ebay-crisis-management-plan"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ebay-data-breach-300x300.png"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Last week, eBay, Inc. disclosed that its database containing sensitive customer information was stolen as early as February of this year.  While customer password databases have been the target for cybercriminals in the past, <a href=""/ebays-recent-data-breach-biggest-data-breach-u-s-history/"">eBay’s Data Breach</a> is unique because it is more than just an attack on one massive, multinational corporation – it’s an attack on the many businesses who operate through eBay in a traditional retail eCommerce setting.  So the data breach has the potential to disrupt the operations of the hundreds of retailers, big and small, who use eBay to buy and sell goods to their own customers.

Ebay was founded on September 3, 1995. Throughout it's history the company has described itself in many ways. Here are some ways in which eBay describes itself:
<ul class=""bullets"">
	<li>“The Commerce Revolution”</li>
	<li>“consumer behavior is shifting, and a ""new retail"" environment is emerging”</li>
	<li>“It's less about location and more about consumer engagement - anytime, anywhere.”</li>
	<li>“Just a few years ago, most retailers were fearful. They weren't sure how to respond to the changing retail landscape. But, to paraphrase Twain, the rumors of retail's demise were greatly exaggerated. The store will not disappear. It will evolve. Online commerce will not devour offline retail, but will transform how we shop and pay.”</li>
</ul>
eBay’s handling of the hacked information <strong>has been criticized by many</strong> and caused concerned customers to demand an explanation from the company.  While <strong>no cyber security plan is infallible</strong>, eBay’s current predicament is a good example of why every company, big or small, <strong>should have a crisis management plan</strong> in place.

An effective, written <a href=""/practices/crisis-risk-management/"">crisis management plan</a> will have several components to it, including:
<ul class=""bullets"">
	<li>An understanding of one’s computer systems, security, and vulnerabilities</li>
	<li>Recognition of common threats, both external threats and internal, company insiders</li>
	<li>Identification of critical <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">intellectual property</a>, know-how, and infrastructure that the company deems confidential, as well as protected personal information</li>
	<li>A crisis management team, ideally one that includes oversight personnel, internal support, public relations, in-house counsel, human resources, and IT</li>
	<li>Methods to communicate effectively and strategically</li>
</ul>
Let eBay’s incident be a lesson to all companies with an Internet presence.  Companies need to acknowledge that the information they harvest is extremely valuable and is the target for competitors and non-competitors alike.  Of course, preventing these types of attacks and thefts is the number one priority.  However, when the inevitable breach does occur, the victim corporation cannot sit back—it must execute its thoroughly-planned crisis management strategy immediately and do its best to remedy the situation with the foremost concern being customer privacy and customer appeasement.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>New York, NY, June 10, 2014 –</strong> Anthony R. Caruso, Esq., partner and chair of the Sports, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Group of Scarinci Hollenbeck LLC, appeared Monday, June 9, 2014, on the Morning Show for PIX Channel 11 TV/CNN with former college player Frank Corbett in New York City. Mr. Caruso discussed the legal impact of a lawsuit filed by a former college basketball player seeking to end the NCAA’s control over the rights to college athletes’ names, images, and likenesses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As it stands, college athletes whose talent makes universities millions cannot profit from their own images outside of scholarships given to them by their schools. Former <a href=""http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/ncaa-takes-hit-obannon-lawsuit/"">UCLA basketball forward Ed O’Bannon’s lawsuit </a>aims to change that. Sports attorney Anthony Caruso visited the PIX11 Morning News on Monday to examine what the litigation means for the young athletes analyzing whether or not they can profit from their own image. Mr. Caruso commented that “There is going to be some kind of benefit back to the players, whether it is this lawsuit or the many others.” Caruso continued, “The NCAA model is under challenge right now, and it probably will be revised. If this case is even won a little bit, it will open up new ideas and new concepts.” To view the entire WPIX11 televised interview please see below or use this link: <a href=""http://pix11.com/2014/06/09/ncaa-suit-seeks-profit-potential-for-players/"">http://pix11.com/2014/06/09/ncaa-suit-seeks-profit-potential-for-players/</a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Insurance Accounting &amp; Systems Association (IASA) invited <a href=""/attorneys/partners/fernando-m-pinguelo/"">Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner Fernando Pinguelo</a>, to speak on a panel addressing cyber security and data privacy issues facing the insurance industry at the 2014 IASA Annual Educational Conference and Business Show in Indianapolis, June 8-11, 2014. Hundreds of insurance-related employees, owners, and entrepreneurs gathered to discuss the latest issues that confront the industry. IASA is a non-profit education association that strives to enhance the knowledge of insurance professionals and participants from similar organizations closely allied with the insurance business. The IASA is one of the insurance industry’s largest and most respected trade associations. IASA’s main goal is to enhance the knowledge of insurance professionals through the exchange of ideas and information.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the highlights of this yearly event was the keynote address, which was delivered by Former President Bill Clinton. President Clinton has been vocal about his cyber security stance during and after his presidency. For example, the President created the first national strategy to prepare the United States to defend cyber threats. He has advocated for strengthening cyber security through public-private partnerships and that <a href=""/practices/crisis-risk-management/"">private entities should create an information-sharing mechanism to better respond to cyber-attacks</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At this year’s conference, one of its “Super Sessions” was focused on emerging issues in technology and cyber security liability. Three panelists discussed how these issues will affect computer and software systems in the insurance industry and the lessons and knowledge they imparted can be applied to many other tech-savvy trades. Fernando Pinguelo, Chair of <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection</a> group at Scarinci Hollenbeck, was one of the panelists who spoke about issues of privacy, security of data, potential incursions into back-end systems and the growing threat posed by hackers looking to breach any insurer’s cyber security or that of their policy holders.  These issues are a concern not only for businesses that utilize computers as a part of their day to day operations, but to private citizens as well.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fernando Pinguelo serves as Chair of the <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"" target=""_blank"">Cyber Security &amp; Data Protection group at Scarinci Hollenbeck</a>. He is experienced in all facets of litigation (trial, mediation, arbitration, and appellate) in both federal and state courts.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to Chambers &amp; Partners, more than 140 researchers work full time to investigate which lawyers and firms are suitable for recommendation. Chambers states that “individual lawyers are ranked on the basis of their legal knowledge and experience, their ability, their effectiveness, and their client-service.” The selection process at Chambers is multi-tiered. To begin, researchers conduct interviews with clients who are active in the legal field. These clients can be law firms or other lawyers. Then researchers assess the recent work done by prospective attorneys and firms. Finally, Chambers holds internal meetings to scrutinize the research used to compile and approve the ranking tables.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Chambers Guides have been ranking the best lawyers and law firms since 1990, and now covers over 180 jurisdictions throughout the world, with heir slogan being, <em>""Your Guide to the World's Best Lawyers.""</em> They rank both lawyers and law firms based on the research of editors and researchers. They determine their rankings by speaking directly to lawyers and clients where they conduct intensive telephone interviews.  Chambers also uses information that is submitted directly from law firms. However, Chambers asserts their most credible source of information is their in-depth face-to-face and telephone interviews.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>International In-house Counsel</i>, an independent journal, conducted a survey of over 20,000 in-house attorneys from around the world and found that more than half of all law firms prefer to use Chambers as their go-to directory to identify law firms and individuals.</p>

8466,"EBRU-TV Invites Partner Robert E. Levy to Discuss Controversial Arizona and Ferguson Shootings ","<strong>Lyndhurst, N.J., September 5, 2014 – </strong>Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner Robert E. Levy recently appeared as a guest on EBRU-TV’s compelling series, “Fresh Outlook,” to provide legal commentary on current issues concerning <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-02/"" target=""_blank"">constitutional law and gun rights</a>. Mr. Levy and a distinguished panel discussed the accidental firearm instructor shooting by a nine-year-old girl in Arizona, as well as the lawsuit filed against the Ferguson police department for the shooting death of Michael Brown. In addition, the panel touched upon the sister of the Boston bombing suspect who was recently arrested and charged for making a bomb threat in New York City.

“Given the nature of the current political and legal issues confronting national news media streams, I was excited for the opportunity to analyze these recently disputed, highly-publicized cases,” mentioned Mr. Levy. He continued, “I look forward to working more closely with EBRU-TV in the future.”

Mr. Levy and the panel analyzed issues raised from these cases and debated who is responsible for the incidents. The panel first discussed the shooting in Dolan Springs, Arizona where a nine-year old girl accidentally shot her firearm instructor with a fully-automatic, 9 mm Uzi. The panel debated the questions: <em>Should there be an appropriate age limitation set when handling a gun?</em> As well as, <em>who’s to blame, the parents, the instructor, or both? </em>Mr. Levy asserted that the problem lies with both the parents and the instructor.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/X7ZQ7H29ybU"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
Mr. Levy also spoke on the current lawsuit filed against the Ferguson, Missouri police department that stems from the August 9<sup>th</sup> shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown, as a result of alleged deadly force used by police officer Darren Wilson. Mr. Levy commented, “Once we heard that there was a tape recording of shots being fired, the critical element here is going to be: What did the officer say before he knew there was a recording?”

Robert E. Levy is a certified Civil and Criminal Trial Attorney and Chair of Scarinci Hollenbeck’s Litigation Group. He regularly appeared on CourtTV (now known as TruTV) to comment on various high-profile, legal cases.

8473,"Fast Food Worker Strike and Minimum Wage Protest","<strong>New York, NY, September 9, 2014</strong> – Gary S. Young, Esq., a prominent business employment lawyer and Partner at the Law Offices of Scarinci Hollenbeck, was invited to discuss the recent fast food worker strike on EBRU-TV’s weekly talk show “<em>Fresh Outlook</em>”. Mr. Young joined a prestigious panel of professionals to discuss the strike, the workers’ right to unionize and the possible effects of raising the federal minimum wage.

[caption id=""attachment_8474"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fast-Food-Workers-Strike.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-8474 size-large"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fast-Food-Workers-Strike-1024x783.jpg"" alt=""Fast Food Workers Strike "" width=""1024"" height=""783"" /></a> On the set of EBRU-TV's ""Fresh Outlook""[/caption]

The latest strike, which occurred Thursday, September 4, is the seventh such protest since November 2012 in New York, during which 200 fast food employees walked out of their jobs. This time, workers at fast food restaurant chains across the country walked off the job in 150 cities. They are demanding a raise to $15 per hour and the right to unionize, but while being credited with influencing policy and public opinion in favor of workers’ rights, their demands are unmet as of yet.

Those opposed to raising the minimum wage argue that doing so will put an unreasonable strain on the U.S. economy, an effect that economists call a “distortion.” They argue that small companies struggling to compete could go out of business as a result of such an increase and that the end result will be a higher rate of unemployment. Those in favor of the legislation say that large companies can afford to pay their employees considerably more, and that employment is unlikely to drop precipitously, because most of these businesses already staff the minimum number of people necessary. They also argue that increasing the minimum wage will result in a broader base for consumer spending, which in turn should result in higher profitability for many of these businesses.

Young weighed both sides of the issue carefully.

“I’m in favor of [<a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/voters-approve-minimum-wage-increase-for-new-jersey-workers/"">raising the minimum wage</a>] if it works and if it doesn’t dislocate the economics of the industry,” Young told the panel. “Working with restaurateurs, many find it very hard to make ends meet. The truth of the matter is that many of the franchisees are small businesses, and when you increase their costs – and we’re talking about doubling the wage by legislative fiat – that has a tremendous impact.”

“The bottom line is, I don’t think anybody in their right mind would say, ‘we don’t want people to do better and have more,’” Young continued, “but it’s a question of where does that come from and what effect does that have, ultimately? Does it benefit the worker, and if it doesn’t, should we be doing it?

Caruso, Esq., partner and chair of the Sports, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Group of Scarinci Hollenbeck LLC, was featured in a recent article by David Lariviere for Forbes, titled, ""<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidlariviere/2014/09/09/is-it-fair-if-suspension-results-in-end-of-ray-rices-nfl-career/""><em>Is It Fair If Suspension Results In End Of Ray Rice's NFL Career?</em></a><em>""</em>. In it, they discussed the controversy surrounding the Ray Rice domestic abuse case, likely penalties on and off the field and the respective roles of the NFL and federal courts in this case.

Caruso, NFL Agent, Sports Attorney"" width=""335"" height=""367"" /></a>The case surrounding Rice attracted significant public attention after it came out that the NFL initially suspended the player for only two games. Not long after this, a video emerged of Rice attempting to pull his apparently unconscious wife out of a hotel elevator. Rice is expected to receive a suspension for at least two seasons. The article speculates as to whether any NFL teams would be interested in signing the running back if he is reinstated after an extended absence from the NFL. Caruso noted that he believed Rice deserves the punishment and that the NFL and the Ravens had no choice but to distance themselves from the player.

“[NFL Commissioner Roger] Goodell’s on the chopping block. At least he admitted he made a mistake but the NFL really blew this one,” Caruso said. “I think it will be at least two seasons, but I think Goodell will take extra time on making this announcement, maybe close to the playoffs.”

Drawing from his experience in sports and entertainment law, Caruso said that the state of New Jersey is treating Rice as a first-time offender. This permitted him to enter a pre-trial intervention program and will ""likely avoid jail time.""

Caruso, Esq</a>., partner and chair of the <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law/"">Sports, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Group</a> of Scarinci Hollenbeck LLC, has been officially certified as a NFLPA Contract Advisor, otherwise known as a certified NFL Agent.

Caruso, NFL Agent, Sports Attorney"" width=""268"" height=""300"" /></a>Within the process to become an NFL Agent a test administered in Washington, D.C. is required. When Caruso was asked why he decided to take the time and go through the process to become certified as a NFLPA Contract Advisor he replied, “I am constantly approached by friends and clients and asked to provide advice on selecting and dealing with NFL agents. I realized that perhaps I should step up and follow my own advice on how to represent NFL players in an honest but aggressive manner. For me, integrity comes first.”

Caruso is uniquely positioned to represent pro football players because of his extensive experience in sports and business law. As a prominent sports, media, &amp; entertainment attorney based in the New York City / New Jersey area, he previously served as an NFL Agent for several pro players from 1994 to 2000. “I enjoyed protecting the interests of the professional athlete both on and off the field”, says Caruso.

Caruso relinquished his certification to pursue a once in a lifetime business venture, but subsequently decided to return to the sports agent scene. “I guess I missed the challenges of being a football agent” says Caruso. “I feel that I have a lot more to offer pro players than the average agent. Besides being a former agent and having over 25 years as a business attorney, I also teach sports related courses at NYU and have significant experience in negotiating complex transactions relevant to the professional athlete. And, I happen to be the parent of a current college football player at a Division I program.”

Caruso also previously founded and served as legal counsel to a new sports league, where he later became the commissioner. He gained international attention in his representation of Miss New Jersey 2007 regarding a blackmail situation over Internet photos.

8685,"John M. Scagnelli R&K Associates, LLC v. Des Champs Laboratories","<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, December 3, 2014</strong> – Scarinci Hollenbeck is proud to announce that Partner John M. Scagnelli, Chair of the firm’s <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use"">Environmental and Land Use Law</a> Group, and William A. Baker, Esq., had a successful result in a case they tried before Administrative Law Judge Gail M. Cookson in the Office of Administrative Law (OAL), <strong>R&amp;K Associates, LLC v. Des Champs Laboratories, Inc</strong>, representing Petitioner R&amp;K Associates, LLC. [OAL DKT. NO. ESR 11666-13]

[caption id=""attachment_7193"" align=""alignright"" width=""282""]<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scagnelli.jpg""><img class=""john-image"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scagnelli-282x300.jpg"" alt=""John Scagnelli Environmental Lawyer"" width=""282"" height=""300"" /></a> Partner John M. Scagnelli[/caption]

The case, decided on November 19, 2014, involved the nunc pro tunc availability of an ISRA <em>DeMinimus</em> Quantity Exemption (DQE) to Des Champs Laboratories, Inc., which had sold its Livingston, N.J. property to R&amp;K in 1997. Des Champs originally obtained an ISRA NFA Approval for the sale, based upon a Negative Declaration stating there was no contamination on the property.

In 2008, the <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/dep/"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</a> (NJDEP) determined that the property was the source of contamination of Livingston’s drinking water wells, rescinded Des Champs’ NFA Approval, and directed Des Champs to undertake the remediation. Instead of undertaking the remediation, Des Champs filed a nunc pro tunc ISRA DQE application with NJDEP. NJDEP denied Des Champs’ DQE application on the ground that the property was contaminated.

The case went to the Appellate Division in 2012 (Des Champs I). The Appellate Division reversed, holding that contamination of the property was not a ground for the denial of an ISRA DQE application, but remanded the case to NJDEP to permit R&amp;K to participate in the Agency’s decision making process regarding Des Champs’ request for a DQE. Instead of involving R&amp;K, NJDEP issued Des Champs a DQE without giving R&amp;K the right to participate in the remand process. The case went back up to the Appellate Division (Des Champs II), and <a href=""/environmental-attorneys-successful-in-superior-court-appeal/"">the Appellate Division in 2013 held that NJDEP</a> had arbitrarily and capriciously shut R&amp;K out from the remand process. The Appellate Division again remanded the case back to NJDEP, and a contested OAL hearing was held. ALJ Cookson held that Des Champs could not rely upon the DQE exemption to come into ISRA compliance nunc pro tunc. The Judge alternatively held that Des Champs was likely not initially eligible for an ISRA DQE, based upon the testimony of its environmental consultant, and that Des Champs had withheld selective information regarding its potential areas of concern at the property.

The ALJ decision will go before the NJDEP Commissioner for review, modification, or reversal, and after that, to the Appellate Division.

9143,"NJ Supreme court clarifies independent contractor test","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What Does the Independent Contractor Test ""ABC Test"" determine?</h2>
At the request of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided an important employment law issue that significantly impacts New Jersey businesses and workers. In <em><a href=""http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A-70-12HargrovevSleepys.pdf"">Hargrove v. Sleepy’s, LLC</a></em>, the state’s highest court found that the Independent Contractor Test or “ABC test” determines whether a worker is an “independent contractor” or “employee” for the purposes of the New Jersey Wage Payment and Wage and Hour Laws. This ruling definitively resolves a wide-spread controversy while making clear that the more nebulous standards of the federal government are superseded by the New Jersey test.
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Facts of the Case</strong></span></h2>
Plaintiffs Sam Hargrove, Andre Hall, and Marco Eusebio worked as delivery drivers for defendant Sleepy’s, LLC. Their <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">federal employment lawsuit</a> alleged that they suffered various financial and non-financial losses as a result of the defendant’s misclassification of them as independent contractors. Plaintiffs each signed an “Independent Drive Agreement,” which they maintained was designed to deny them employee benefits.

The U.S. District Court applied the twelve-factor “right to control test” established by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden</em>, 503 U.S. 318 (1992) and generally <a href=""/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-corporate-transactions-and-business-law/"">used to define who is an “employee” under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA). Under this analysis, the lower court agreed with the employer that the plaintiffs should be classified as independent contractors.

On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that New Jersey’s public policy rejected the “right to control test” as the exclusive means of determining a worker’s employment status, noting that the state’s courts have employed the “hybrid test” in cases under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and relied on the “ABC test” when assessing claims brought under the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Act.

Noting that “[n]either the New Jersey Supreme Court nor any other New Jersey appellate court has previously determined which employment test applies to claims that arise under the New Jersey Wage Payment Law or the New Jersey Wage and Hour Law, the Third Circuit petitioned the New Jersey Supreme Court for certification of those questions.
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Court’s Decision</strong></span></h2>
The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the “ABC test” derived from the <a href=""http://nj.gov/labor/uimod/pdfs/UI.pdf"">New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Act</a> governs whether a plaintiff is an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of resolving wage-payment or wage-and-hour claims. <strong>The ABC test <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">presumes that an individual is an employee</span> unless an employer affirmatively demonstrates that: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>The employer neither exercises control over the worker, nor has the ability to exercise control in terms of the completion of the work;</li>
	<li>The services provided are either outside the usual course of business or performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise; and</li>
	<li>The worker has a profession that will plainly persist despite termination of the challenged relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Failure to satisfy any one of these three criteria results in a finding that the person in question is an “employee.”</strong></span></h2>
After considering all of the tests that might be applied, the court concluded that deference should be given to the New Jersey Department of Labor’s selection of the “ABC test” as the appropriate standard to apply under the state’s employment laws. The panel also noted that the test provided the greatest degree of predictability. As explained in the opinion, “Permitting an employee to know when, how, and how much he will be paid requires a test designed to yield a more predictable result than a totality-of-the- circumstances analysis that is by its nature case specific.”
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Message for Employers</strong></span></h2>
Pursuant to the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision, the “ABC test” is now the universal standard for New Jersey for wage law and wage and hour purposes. New Jersey law now presumes that a worker is an employee and such presumption will be rebutted only if the employer demonstrates that all three factors of the test are satisfied.

Accordingly, this is a ""watershed"" decision affecting many companies and industries that typically rely on the use of ""independent contractors.” For example, the trucking, delivery and intermodal industries will be particularly impacted, and should immediately contact experienced counsel to determine how to address the potential legal and business implications of the decision.

While the Court focused on the wage payment and wage and hour implications of this decision, the act of misclassification ripples through other aspects of the employment law quantum. For example, coverage determinations under the Affordable Care Act and eligibility under ERISA employee benefit plans can provide grave consequences for plan sponsors who get this wrong.

14410,"NFL Agent Anthony Caruso Authors Sports Concussions Article","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sports Concussions Legal Research Article Published in University of Maryland Law Journal</h2>
<strong>NEW YORK, NY, February 18, 2015</strong> - <a href=""/attorneys/partners/anthony-r-caruso-esq/"">Anthony R. Caruso, Esq</a>., sports attorney and NFL Agent, has announced the publication of his legal research and analysis on current issues involving sports concussions.

Entitled ""<em><a href=""http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jbtl/vol10/iss1/3/"" target=""_blank"">Collegiate Collisions on the Field and in the Courtroom: Will Labor Peace Save Student-Athletes from Further Injury?</a>"",</em> the article appears in the prestigious Journal of Business and Technology Law of the University of Maryland School of Law. The article is the culmination of legal research and analysis of the ever-evolving topic of concussions in light of recent developments with the NCAA.

[caption id=""attachment_14411"" align=""alignright"" width=""200""]<a href=""/attorneys/anthony-r-caruso""><img class=""wp-image-14411 size-full"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NFL-Agent-Anthony-Caruso.jpg"" alt=""NFL Agent Anthony Caruso Releases Sports Concussion Article"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /></a> NFL Agent Anthony R. Caruso, Esq.[/caption]

“Concussion-related topics are at the forefront of all discussions involving contact sports, and rightfully so”, says Caruso. “For too long, this topic has been side-stepped as a necessary evil for the participation of the athlete. Medical research now clearly obviates any further attempts to ignore the significance and full understanding of this dangerous condition.”

The research article is a detailed and convincing argument for the advancement of education, treatment and prevention of concussions without dismantling the intricate framework of the student athlete as currently existing. “This issue needs to be resolved in a thoughtful and well-conceived manner by all parties involved, rather than in a fragmented and incongruent fashion by various courts throughout the nation”, says Caruso. “Those involved with college and pro sports at various levels have been aware of concussions for quite some time, but have yet to seriously address the inherently competing issues until very recently. We need to keep the momentum moving forward in favor of the player, particularly the student-athlete.”

Launched in the fall of 2005, the <em>Journal of Business &amp; Technology Law</em> has provided a publication venue for the latest thinking on business and technology issues. As the first publication to examine these issues together, the Journal seeks to add an important voice to the nation’s legal scholarship. The publication can be found using the following link: <a href=""http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jbtl/"">http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jbtl/</a>.

Caruso is uniquely positioned to comment on issues concerning college and pro football players because of his extensive experience in <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment/"">sports and business law</a>. As a prominent sports, media, &amp; entertainment attorney based in the New York City / New Jersey area, he has significant experience in negotiating complex transactions relevant to the professional athlete and served as an NFL Agent for several pro players from 1994 to 2000. “I enjoyed protecting the interests of the professional athlete both on and off the field”, says Caruso. He has now returned to the role of NFL agent and has several players under his representation.

In addition to being a sports entertainment attorney and NFL agent, Caruso teaches sports related courses as an adjunct professor at NYU. He also previously founded and served as legal counsel to a new sports league, where he later became the commissioner. He gained international attention in his representation of beauty pageant winner regarding a media blackmail situation. Mr. Caruso provided all legal counseling and negotiations, strategy, media supervision, and crisis management in that case. He has appeared on various programs including NBC, FOX, MSNBC and E! News, and is routinely requested by the media for his advice and views on current sports/legal issues.

</div>
<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, February 25, 2015</strong> - Scarinci Hollenbeck is pleased to announce that <strong>Environmental Attorney <a href=""/attorney/todd-w-terhune"">Todd W. Terhune</a></strong> has joined the firm as a partner in its <strong>Environmental &amp; Land Use</strong> Group. He will also serve as Co-Chair of the firm’s Brownfields and Infrastructure Subgroup. Terhune brings more than two decades of experience in the environmental field, practicing first as a licensed Professional Engineer and, for the past 15 years, as an <strong>environmental attorney</strong>. His practical, business-oriented approach to environmental problems makes him a welcome addition to the<a href=""/attorneys""> Scarinci Hollenbeck team</a>.

Terhune says, “I was honored when Scarinci Hollenbeck asked me to join their team. They have a highly respected <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use/"">environmental and redevelopment</a> practice and have handled some of the largest and most <strong>complicated brownfield projects</strong> in the State. Scarinci Hollenbeck provides a platform for me to expand my own practice while adding additional depth to their team.”

Terhune has worked on a wide range of <strong>environmental issues</strong> arising out of real estate and business transactions, as well as in regulatory compliance and enforcement matters. He routinely appears before the <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/dep/"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</a> and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, although he has worked with environmental matters on almost every continent.

Terhune’s notable projects include the <a href=""/practices/environmental-remediation-management-scarinci-hollenbeck-practice/""><strong>purchase and remediation</strong></a> of a 400-acre former munitions facility in Cranbury and a 130-acre chemical facility in Burlington Township. He also assisted with the sale of 80 fast food franchise stores across the region, many of which were previously occupied by gas stations or dry cleaners.

Working as an <strong>environmental engineering consultant</strong> and a licensed Professional Engineer, Terhune handled environmental due diligence, <strong>environmental permitting</strong>, soil and groundwater contamination assessment, and landfill gas assessment and control. Terhune notes that his technical background is an invaluable skill when navigating technically driven legal issues and negotiating with environmental consultants, LSRP’s, regulators and adversaries.

Todd obtained his Bachelor of Science from Widener University, where he returned almost a decade later to pursue law. Scarinci Hollenbeck is proud to welcome him to the team.

14638,"How many NSA does it take to anger Wikimedia?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Apparently just one. That’s it.</h2>
The buttons have been pushed and the lawsuit is filed. According to <a href=""http://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/03/10/wikimedia-v-nsa/"">Wikimedia’s recent Blog</a> posting, it referenced its intent to file a lawsuit against the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the Department of Justice (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice"">DOJ</a>), captioned <em>Wikimedia Foundation, et al. v. National Security Agency/Central Security Service, et al.</em>, U.S. District Court – District of Maryland, Case No.: 15-cv-00662 (RDB) (March 10, 2015).

The grounds for which <a href=""http://ewhwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Wikimedia_v._NSA_Complaint21.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Wikimedia is basing its lawsuit</a> involve the <strong>mass surveillance program</strong> that the NSA has been implementing. One of the most troublesome facets of this program, according to Wikimedia’s pleading, is the NSA’s search and seizure of internet communications, which is called “Upstream” surveillance. Wikimedia argues that these actions violate its users most basic of rights, citing the U.S. Constitution’s <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-01/"">First Amendment</a> protection of freedom of speech, and <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-04/"">Fourth Amendment</a> protection against unreasonable search and seizure because defendants’ conduct involved suspicionless seizure and searching of Internet traffic by NSA on U.S. soil.

<strong>The founder of Wikipedia</strong>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales"">Jimmy Wales</a>, continues to emphasize that user privacy is of utmost importance. When such privacy is put in question, and people fear that their information will be leaked, the Wiki experience is seriously undermined. This issue, with the NSA specifically, was made much more serious and <em>real</em> with the <strong>Edward Snowden</strong> <a href=""https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/06/14/prism-surveillance-wikimedia/"">2013 public disclosures</a>, which revealed information about Wikimedia’s programs. According to its blog postings, Wikimedia has been looking for a way to file a lawsuit ever since this incident. Zeroing in on the “upstream” surveillance aspect allows the suit to serve as a vehicle to address Wikimedia’s views on how deeply rooted and harmful the issue is because it is tapping into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone"">backbone</a> of the internet, including the vast network of high-capacity cables, switches, and routers “that today carry vast numbers of Americans’ communications with each other and with the rest of the world.”

In other words, when the <strong>NSA monitors </strong><em><strong>everything</strong>, </em>the very integrity of the Internet is impugned and Wikimedia is taking a stand. This is not the first time Wikimedia has protested when it felt certain rights were being encroached on improperly. For example, in 2012 Wiki implemented a <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/no-lol-wikipedia-sites-set-dark-protest-sopa-bill-article-1.1007665"">Wikipedia blackout</a> to protest the anti-piracy laws that the U.S. Congress considered enacting at the time. Much like in the current issue, Wikimedia took action to proclaim that it did not support the influence that the government was trying to exert over what it believed should continue to be a <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/no-lol-wikipedia-sites-set-dark-protest-sopa-bill-article-1.1007665"">free and open internet</a>.

The Wiki lawsuit raises a number of important questions, including whether any surveillance is appropriate, and if so, who’s the appropriate body to surveil and <strong>how much surveillance is too much?</strong>

One can argue that within cyberspace there is a certain amount of necessary precautions that must be taken to help ensure public safety and the Internet’s integrity. Under that premise, it would be inappropriate to eliminate all oversight especially if it were necessary to maintain the very integrity that the Internet is designed to ensure. But again, the issue comes down to “who” – who should be allowed to surveil, including who’s in the best position to “protect the public and the Internet”?
<ul>
	<li>Is it the government – if so, who’s government?</li>
	<li>A website’s creator – if so, does it matter that the site is driven by profits over safety? Or would a non-profit website serve a more credible role?</li>
</ul>
As with most complex issues – it depends. So then, does Wikimedia have a legitimate basis to file suit? That remains to be seen as the lawsuit proceeds. But challenges to the levels on which human rights are being encroached are always fair game in a free society. Individuals like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden"">Edward Snowden</a> serve to test the parameters of that premise. The level of NSA surveillance has become the lightening rod to test the scope of what’s appropriate – and not. This is what Wikimedia, in part, appears to be arguing, that the <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html"">NSA has reached too far</a>.

14670,"Bad Google, Bad Google. Whatcha Gonna Do When They Come For You?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Google Antitrust Lawsuit</h2>
Apparently, back in March 2015, Google had to respond to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s report of how often Google held meetings with the White House (230 times to be exact, since Obama took office). Google’s response claimed that there were several different topics of conversation discussed over the course of these meetings, and that nothing shady was going on. However, speculation persists that the timing of these meetings in relation to other key events is extremely suspicious because a large number of these meetings occurred just before antitrust investigations on Google halted back in 2013. Google holds strong in saying that these meetings had <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/google-response-to-wall-street-journal-about-white-house-visits-ftc-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">nothing to do with the antitrust allegations</a>.

The plot thickens as new reports, this time from <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/microsoft-once-an-antitrust-target-is-now-googles-regulatory-scold.html?emc=edit_th_20150416&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=33425193&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank""><em>The New York Times</em></a>, reveal that Microsoft has connections, to varying degrees, with three of the initial complainants that spurred the antitrust investigation into Google.

<strong>SO, the main point of suspicion:</strong> Upsurge in the number of meetings just before U.S. antitrust investigations into Google ended in 2013, the end result of which was zero action.

Questions are now being raised about White House involvement in U.S. investigations into Google, and the Senate has decided to investigate. According to a recent article, ""[a] Senate panel plans to investigate whether<a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/senate-to-investigate-white-house-role-in-google-s-antitrust-victory-20150330"" target=""_blank""> the White House inappropriately derailed a federal investigation</a> into accusations that Google was stifling online competition."" If there were any truth to this theory, this may have a significant impact on Google’s business and the White House’s integrity.

Google’s troubles do not end there. It was announced on April 14, 2015 that Google is expected to face <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/business/international/google-expected-to-face-antitrust-charges-in-europe.html?emc=edit_na_20150414&amp;nlid=33425193"">new antitrust charges</a> from the European Commission. The charges allege that Google has been using its dominant position as a search engine to favor its services/products over those of other companies. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager"" target=""_blank"">Margrethe Vestager</a> is currently the European Union’s top antitrust official and will be deciding what route the allegations will take.

<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/business/international/google-expected-to-face-antitrust-charges-in-europe.html?emc=edit_na_20150414&amp;nlid=33425193"">Current discussion</a> on the issue suggests that this is only the beginning of Europe taking on large American companies. European companies have yet to rival the success of several of America’s superpowers, such as Google – so this may also be a pointed effort at giving Europe’s own home grown companies a competitive edge. Regardless, Google is presently under a very large and powerful microscope and, potentially, in a lot of trouble. (Notwithstanding, of course, reports about <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32307096"" target=""_blank"">Google’s message to its employees</a> on Tuesday that it had a ""very strong case"" and is expected to defend itself robustly in what could become one of the most contentious antitrust cases since the EU took on Microsoft 10 years ago).

14681,"Precedential Ruling in DEP Decision on ISRA DQE Exemption","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Significant Victory for Client R&amp;K Associates, LLC in a <strong>Precedent-Setting </strong>Case</h2>
Scarinci Hollenbeck has announced a significant victory for its client R&amp;K Associates, LLC in a precedential case tried by John M. Scagnelli, Partner and Chair of the <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use/"">Environmental and Land Use Law</a> Group, together with William A. Baker, Esq. also of that group. The case <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>R&amp;K Associates, LLC v. Des Champs Laboratories, Inc</strong>.</span> involved the availability of an ISRA (Industrial Site Recovery Act) De Minimis Quantity Exemption (DQE) to Des Champs Laboratories, Inc. which sold its Livingston, New Jersey property to R&amp;K in 1997. The matter was tried before an OAL administrative law judge and decided by <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/dep/"" target=""_blank"">NJDEP Commissioner Martin</a> who issued a Final Decision in favor of R&amp;K.
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The ruling in this matter has far-reaching implications for owners of industrial establishments seeking<strong> ISRA DQEs</strong> as well as for environmental consultants who perform assessments of their facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
By way of background, at the time of the sale, Des Champs was granted NFA Approval based on a Negative Declaration stating there was no contamination of the property. After finding that the property was the source of contamination of Livingston’s drinking water wells, the NJDEP rescinded that NFA approval in 2008. Then, 12 years after it sold the property, Des Champs filed for an <a href=""environmental-attorneys-successful-in-superior-court-appeal/"">ISRA DQE Exemption</a>. The case went up to the Appellate Division twice, and was remanded for hearing in 2014 before <a href=""/environmental-law-rk-associates-llc-v-des-champs-laboratories-inc-case/"">Judge Gail Cookson who issued an initial decision ruling in favor of R&amp;K</a> on several grounds. Recently, in his Final Decision, NJDEP Commissioner Bob Martin ruled that (i) Des Champs had no standing to apply for an ISRA DQE as a former owner, 12 years after leaving the property; (ii) Des Champs had waived its legal right to apply for an ISRA DQE exemption since it initially obtained ISRA approval through a different route; and (iii) Des Champs had not provided documentary and witness information to the environmental consultant who initially performed the Preliminary Assessment of the Des Champs facility.

The ruling in this matter has far-reaching implications for owners of industrial establishments seeking<strong> ISRA DQEs</strong> as well as for environmental consultants who perform assessments of their facilities.

Mr. Scagnelli explained that “this case is significant as it is the first case that discusses the standards for documentary as well as witness proof of a party’s entitlement to a DQE. The decision makes it clear that the DQE is not an automatic paper exemption – you have to back it up.”

He continued, “The case sets forth the standard of care a party and its environmental consultant need to use in performing an environmental preliminary assessment, and explained the importance of the DEP’s decision. Parties who initially select one way to comply with ISRA statute when selling a property or business cannot – years later – assert that they can comply in a different way if the DEP determines their initial means of compliance was invalid.”

<strong>Lyndhurst, NJ, May 15, 2015 –</strong> Gary S. Young, a distinguished employment law attorney and Partner at Scarinci Hollenbeck, will present an informative discussion at the 2015 Restaurant Operators Conference entitled, “<strong>Are You at Risk for a Discrimination Suit?</strong>”

The event, hosted annually by the <a href=""http://njra.com"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association</a> (NJRHA), is the leading restaurant conference of the year. Mr. Young, as well as other speakers, will share their expertise on a range of topics pertinent to restaurant owners and operators including liquor licensing, workplace safety, food inspection, as well as public relations and social media.

Mr. Young, who serves as NJRHA’s <strong>general counsel</strong>, frequently lectures on <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/fiduciary-liability-claims-under-the-employee-retirement-income-security-act-of-1974-erisa/"" target=""_blank"">ERISA fiduciary matters</a>, pension and tax planning as well as labor law, explained why the topic of discrimination is of particular importance to restaurant owners.

“There have been several important developments in employment law recently – New Jersey specifically – therefore, businesses need to know about them,” he said. “Although I will be discussing employment law issues regarding the restaurant industry, these developments affect other business just as heavily.”

History has created an almost God-like persona for the founding fathers. As lawyers, we refer to them as authority and we defer to them for their wisdom. In reality, the founding fathers were ordinary people, addressing ordinary everyday problems but with extraordinary courage.

“Peyton Dixon as John Adams and Steve Edenbo as Thomas Jefferson will help attendees see these great men as the ordinary Americans they were who were just called upon to do extraordinary things”, said Scarinci.

“The constitution of the United States was not written as a sacred text. It is a living document that derives its life and relevance from the great legal minds who have been selected as its custodians,” said Scarinci.

“ICLE should be commended for encouraging lawyers to see our Constitution and our nation’s founders through the lens of real life people addressing real life circumstances” said Scarinci.

Although Health Care Law is only one of several areas of practice in Mr. Scarinci’s repertoire for which he has earned a stellar reputation, he was named a top lawyer in Health Care Law based upon his extensive knowledge of the health care industry and ability to assist Scarinci Hollenbeck’s clients in making informed business decisions, properly structure transactions and design solutions that comply with complex legislative and regulatory mandates.

Mr. Schwartz is one of New Jersey’s <a href=""/attorneys/theodore-a-schwartz/"">original practitioners of environmental law</a>. From 1965 to 1970, he served as Deputy Attorney General for the State of New Jersey, where he acted as Chief of the Attorney General’s Task Force on Pollution.  He currently is devoted to assisting owners, leaseholders, equity holders, PRPs, and government entities with coordinating project development, developing remediation strategies and management of project related environmental and remediation requirements.

While Messrs. Scarinci and Schwartz have both been selected in past years for this honor, this is the first time for Ms. Barto, a <a href=""/attorneys/frances-e-barto/"">rising star in the profession</a>, recognized for exemplary legal work and professional involvement. Ms. Barto focuses her practice on commercial litigation, representing individuals and business entities, as well as the representation of municipalities, boards of education, and political figures, with respect to tort law claims and constitutional claims in State and Federal Court. She is also an active member of the Bergen County Bar Association, where she is to be sworn in as of September 2015 as President-Elect of the Young Lawyer’s Division for the 2015-2016 term, having previously served as <a href=""/frances-barto-young-lawyers/"">Vice President from 2014-2015</a>, and as Secretary from 2013-2014.  She is also a long-standing member of the New Jersey Young Professionals Group, a state-wide organization promoting social and business development for young professionals.

(New Jersey Courts photo)"" width=""620"" height=""376"" /> Esther Suarez, Scarinci Hollenbeck Alumna, to become next Hudson County prosecutor. (New Jersey Courts photo)[/caption]

Scarinci Hollenbeck is pleased to congratulate Passaic County Judge Esther Suarez on her nomination to the position of Hudson County Prosecutor by Governor Chris Christie. Suarez, a former associate at Scarinci Hollenbeck, was chosen to fill the three-year vacancy and become Hudson County's first female and Hispanic lead prosecutor after a unanimous vote by the state Senate. A Hudson County native and a Superior Court Judge with an impeccable record, Judge Suarez brings a solid background of legal experience to the office. Suarez will replace Guy Gregory, who has been the acting Hudson County prosecutor since August 2012, and her appointment will run five years.

While at Scarinci Hollenbeck, Judge Suarez concentrated on labor and <a href=""/practices/public-law/"">municipal law</a>. Managing partner Donald Scarinci praised her as an extremely competent attorney. “She will make an outstanding prosecutor,” he said, ""she knows Hudson County extremely well.”

Mr. Scarinci continued: “It is significant that the vote was unanimous. The county prosecutor is a constitutional officer nominated and appointed by the governor with the consent of the state Senate. The governor has the authority to make the appointment, but senators in the district have the right to block it, using what’s known as senatorial courtesy.”

Suarez is widely known as a very community-minded woman with innovative ideas. She was praised by many for her investment and commitment on the bench in Passaic, where she worked in the <a href=""http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/passaic/family.htm"" target=""_blank"">family division</a>.

Suarez worked as corporation counsel in Hoboken from 2001 to 2003, and was also the director of the Law Department County Counsel in Bergen County, a county adjuster, and general counsel of the Union City Parking Authority.

Suarez, who currently resides in Secaucus, was born and raised in Bayonne. She received her B.A. from Douglass College, Rutgers University. During college, she also studied abroad at Universite de Tours in France. She earned her Juris Doctor degree from Rutgers University School of Law in 1997.",,20150707,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/uncategorized/alum-is-new-hudson-county-prosecutor/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Judge-Esther-Suarez.jpg,"Judge Esther Suarez","Esther Suarez, Scarinci Hollenbeck Alumna, to become next Hudson County prosecutor.

15788,"Client Perseverance Equals Success in FINRA Arbitration","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner Joel N. Kreizman's Involvement with FINRA Arbitration, Instrumental in Obtaining Victory</h2>
Scarinci Hollenbeck is pleased to announce <a href=""/attorneys/joel-n-kreizman/""><strong>Partner Joel N. Kreizman</strong></a>, was instrumental in helping our clients, Michael and Robin Hirsch and their family limited partnership successfully obtain an award of $552,693 plus pre-judgment interest in a FINRA arbitration against Securities America. This award represented complete compensation for losses suffered by the Hirsches as a result of their <a href=""/scarinci-hollenbeck-partner-joel-n-kreizmans-applicability-equitable-estoppel-featured-new-jersey-lawyer-magazine/"">investment in what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme</a>.

[caption id=""attachment_7180"" align=""alignright"" width=""277""]<img class=""size-medium wp-image-7180"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/J.Kreizman-277x300.jpg"" alt=""Attorney and partner at Scarinci Hollenbeck and is the co-chair of the firm's litigation law practice"" width=""277"" height=""300"" /> Partner Joel N. Kreizman[/caption]

By way of background, the Hirsches had invested $3.4 million with Amper Financial Services LLC, the investment arm of the EisnerAmper accounting firm. Amper was affiliated with Securities America, Inc. (SAI) which purchased securities for the Hirsches. The investments were placed into securitized notes issued by Medical Provider Financial Corporation (Med Cap), which was later deemed to be a Ponzi scheme and closed by the SEC. As a result, the Hirsches lost their entire $550,000 investment. Two related actions were brought against SAI; the FINRA arbitration held in Philadelphia and one against Amper Financial Services, Inc. and EisnerAmper, LLP in Monmouth County, New Jersey.

The Hirsches were not the only investors hurt by Medical Capital’s failure and a class action suit was brought against SAI. The class action settled with claimants receiving less than half of their losses but the Hirsches opted out, choosing instead to go to arbitration.

According to Mr. Kreizman, “I am pleased that our clients refused to go along with a class action settlement and took on Securities America – and the major law firm that represented it. Because of this, after lengthy arbitration we received an award of 100% of the losses.”

“Our clients didn’t back down, even though almost everyone else in the class had settled. It was a matter of principal as much as money; they decided that what was done to them and their family warranted a decision that Securities America breached its duties to them,” Mr. Kreizman continued.

The arbitration was held in Philadelphia and Mr. Kreizman was brought in by lead counsel Mark Schwartz to work with him on the matter. In the related New Jersey suit, Mr. Kreizman was successful in getting the <a href=""/supreme-courts-unanimous-decision-reverses-appellate-division-ruling/"">New Jersey Supreme Court to rule that Hirsches were entitled to a jury trial</a> instead of only being permitted to submit their claim to an arbitration panel. This decision marked a strong precedent in New Jersey for future arbitrated cases.

Scarinci Hollenbeck is proud to congratulate Associate Frances Barto on her role in winning an important victory for our client Montclair State University (“MSU”). <em>In Gomez v. Cumberland USA, Inc.,</em> the Plaintiff Gomez brought a lawsuit against MSU and his employer, Cumberland USA, Inc. an independent contractor hired by MSU, for injuries sustained when he fell from a roof while doing repairs at MSU after a heavy snowstorm. The trial court initially ruled in favor of Plaintiff and denied MSU’s summary judgment motion, rejecting the University’s argument that it was immune from liability under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act ruling that that the property was in a “dangerous condition” at the time of Plaintiff’s injury and that MSU had assumed a legal duty to protect Plaintiff. The appellate panel reversed the trial court’s decision and entered a summary judgment in favor of MSU, dismissing the case with prejudice, ruling that (1) Plaintiffs proofs failed to establish the statutory requirements for imposing liability of a public entity for injuries caused by snow on the roof; (2) MSU had no duty, contractual or otherwise, to make the roof safe for the Plaintiff; (3) MSU’s property contained no “dangerous condition” as defined by the statute; and (4) MSU did not affirmatively created the situation which led to Plaintiff’s injury.

According to Ms. Barto, “Gomez v. MSU is a win for public entities, once again demonstrating the general rule of immunity and the burden on the Plaintiff required to establish liability under the Tort Claims Act. In this case, Plaintiff simply failed to meet that burden.”

Jersey City’s tax abatement process involves the Long-Term Tax Exemption Law, the Five-Year Tax Exemption Law, as well as local ordinances including the <a href=""https://www.municode.com/library/nj/jersey_city/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CH304TA_ARTVILOTEFIYETAEXAFHOTRFUAEN9-28-2005ORNO05-130AM9-11-2013ORNO13-088"">Five- Year Tax Exemption Ordinance</a>.  Under local ordinances, tax abatements may trigger a requirement to enter into a Construction Project Labor Agreement and/or require payments to the Long-Term Tax Exemptions Affordable Housing Trust Fund.  A thorough understanding of these requirements is essential to evaluating and maximizing the true economic value of an abatement.

Under Jersey City’s local tax abatement ordinance, developers of projects with a total project cost exceeding $25,000,000 must enter into Project Labor Agreement with the city, which outlines procedures to resolve labor disputes and mandates employment for Jersey City residents.  Developers receiving long-term tax abatements on projects valued at less than 25,000,000 are required to execute a Project Employment and Contracting Agreement (PECA), which establishes good faith goals for hiring Jersey City residents and awarding contracts to local businesses.

To encourage redevelopment in parts of Jersey City where municipal officials believe it is most needed, the City has adopted a <a href=""http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/uploadedFiles/JC%20TAX%20ABATEMENT%20POLICY%20AND%20MAP(2).pdf"">tiered long-term tax abatement program</a> under which projects located in different “zones” are eligible for different incentives.  Under the policy, which Mayor Fulop enacted in 2013, developers building in Journal Square are eligible for a 30-year tax abatement, while projects in parts of the West Side, the Heights, and the southeastern waterfront can receive tax breaks for ten years. Each tier has both geographic and legal requirements.  There are also buy-up provisions that provide for longer terms in exchange for additional concessions.

Scarinci Hollenbeck’s skilled attorneys possess vast experience in the <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/"">representation of owners and developers pursuing redevelopment projects in Jersey City</a>. Our lawyers routinely help developers explore the availability of exemptions and abatements intended to limit or defer the burden of property tax. Once the application is filed, we also assist with the negotiation of the related abatement agreements to achieve the best result for our clients. Since failure to comply with the terms of a financial agreement, PICA or Employment Labor Agreement, or failure to make timely payments under a financial agreement can result in termination of the tax abatement, Scarinci Hollenbeck can also help ensure compliance during and after the project is completed.",,20150819,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/tax-abatement-attorney-in-jersey-city-nj/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tax-Abatement-Attorney-in-Jersey-City.jpg,"Tax Abatement Attorney in Jersey City",,,,,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate>Tax Abatement",,publish,15,tax-abatement-attorney-in-jersey-city-nj,,,0,0,closed,open

<h2>In New Jersey, the Five-Year Tax Exemption Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:21-1 et seq.) governs short-term tax abatements for improvements to one and two family homes, multi-family dwellings, and commercial/industrial buildings.</h2>
The statute authorizes municipalities to grant five-year tax exemptions and/or abatements in areas in need of rehabilitation to promote the <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/"">construction and rehabilitation of residential, commercial and industrial structures</a>.

Abatements are only available if the municipality has determined the property to be an “area in need of rehabilitation” of an “Area in need of redevelopment.”  In addition, the municipality in which the property is located must have adopted an authorizing ordinance, which establishes specific application procedures and eligibility criteria. Many municipalities, including Jersey City, differentiate for the purposes of determining eligibility among the various neighborhoods, zones, areas or portions of the designated area in need of rehabilitation or redevelopment.

To obtain a tax abatement, the developer must satisfy all of the criteria in the statute and general ordinance. For applicants seeking to improve dwellings, commercial, and industrial structures or convert buildings to multiple dwelling use, the application process is fairly straightforward. Once the application is approved, <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/lpt/ea1.pdf"">Form E/A-1</a> must be filed with the tax assessor within 30 days of completion of the improvement, conversion or construction.

<strong>Application Requirements for New Construction</strong>

Pursuant to the Five-Year Tax Exemption Law, applicants for tax abatement involving new construction of commercial or industrial structures or multiple dwellings must submit an application that requires more detailed information, including:
<ul>
	<li>A general description of a project for which exemption and abatement is sought;</li>
	<li>A legal description of all real estate necessary for the project;</li>
	<li>Plans, drawings and other documents as may be required by the governing body to demonstrate the structure and design of the project;</li>
	<li>A description of the number, classes and type of employees to be employed at the project site within two years of completion of the project;</li>
	<li>A statement of the reasons for seeking tax exemption and abatement on the project, and a description of the benefits to be realized by the applicant if a tax agreement is granted;</li>
	<li>Estimates of the cost of completing such project;</li>
	<li>A statement showing (1) the real property taxes currently being assessed at the project site; (2) estimated tax payments that would be made annually by the applicant on the project during the period of the agreement, and (3) estimated tax payments that would be made by the applicant on the project during the first full year following the termination of the tax agreement;</li>
	<li>If the project is a commercial or industrial structure, a description of any lease agreements between the applicant and proposed users of the project, and a history and description of the users' businesses; and</li>
	<li>If the project is a multiple dwelling, a description of the number and types of dwelling units to be provided, a description of the common elements or general common elements, and a statement of the proposed initial rentals or sales prices of the dwelling units according to type and of any rental lease or resale restrictions to apply to the dwellings' units respecting low or moderate income housing.</li>
</ul>
Developers should also be aware that many municipalities impose additional requirements. For instance, <a href=""https://www.municode.com/library/nj/jersey_city/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CH304TA_ARTVILOTEFIYETAEXAFHOTRFUAEN9-28-2005ORNO05-130AM9-11-2013ORNO13-088"">Jersey City’s tax abatement ordinance</a> requires applicants to provide a disclosure statement of the interests of all parties, including subsidiary companies, in the property project and other projects located within the City for which an abatement or exemption was previously awarded.

<strong>Calculating Payments in Lieu of Taxes</strong>

Once the tax abatement application has been approved via the adoption of a municipal ordinance, the municipality and developer must execute a <a href=""http://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-40a/section-40a-21-10/"">written agreement setting forth the payments in lieu of taxes that will be paid</a> (often referred to as a “PILOT Agreement”). Pursuant to the Five-Year Tax Exemption Law, the agreement must use one of three formulas. Under the cost-based formula, the applicant must pay a percentage of the cost of the project. The gross-revenue basis requires the developer to pay to the municipality an amount annually equal to a percentage of the annual gross revenues from the project. Finally, the tax phase-in scheme requires the applicant to submit payments in accordance with the following schedule: no payments the first year after completion; payment of not less than 20 percent of ad valorem taxes otherwise due in year two; 40 percent of ad valorem taxes in year three; 60 percent of ad valorem taxes in year four; and 80 percent of ad valorem taxes in year five.

If the property owner ceases to operate or disposes of the property or fails to meet the conditions for qualifying for the exemption, the local property taxes due for all the prior years subject to exemption and for the current year must be paid as if no exemption had been granted.

As highlighted above, it is certainly lucrative to pursue a tax abatement in New Jersey. However, it can also be a complicated and time-consuming endeavor. Therefore, it is generally advisable to partner with an experienced attorney who can walk you through the process.",,20150819,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/how-to-file-a-five-year-tax-abatement-in-new-jersey/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/File-A-Tax-Abatement.jpg,"File A Tax Abatement",,,,,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate>Tax Abatement",,publish,15,how-to-file-a-five-year-tax-abatement-in-new-jersey,,,0,0,closed,open

In an effort to foster redevelopment and revitalize the city, Jersey City provides long-term tax breaks to residential and commercial real estate developers.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Basic Framework of New Jersey Tax Abatements</strong></p><p>Tax abatements are used throughout the country to incentivize development. Typically, municipalities enter into a written financial agreement with developers that calls for the payment of a set, lower fee for a specified period of time in place of traditional real estate taxes on improvements.</p><p>In New Jersey, tax exemptions are authorized under the state Constitution, which states that certain properties in blighted areas “may be exempted from taxation, in whole or in part, for a limited period of time during which the profits and dividends payable by any private corporation enjoying such tax exemption shall be limited by law.” In 1991, the state enacted the Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:21-1 et seq., and the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, N.J.S.A. 40 A: 20-1 et seq., which statutes currently govern the abatement process. An abatement tax is technically referred to as a “Payment In Lieu Of Taxes” (PILOT).</p><p>As the name suggests, the <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/lpt/ea1info.shtml"">Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law</a> authorizes lower tax payments for projects involving the rehabilitation of particular buildings and structures, with a maximum abatement period of five years. Meanwhile, the Long Term Tax Exemption Law is reserved for larger-scale development projects and allows for the abatement term to extend for 30 years after project completion. In either case, developers must submit abatement applications to the municipality for review, which are then approved through the adoption of a local ordinance.</p><p><strong>Tax Abatements in Jersey City</strong></p><p>Since taking office in 2013, <a href=""http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/uploadedFiles/Public_Notices/Press_Releases/Jersey%20City%20Tax%20Abatement%20Policy%20Press%20Release.pdf"">Mayor Steve Fulop has revised the city’s policy on tax abatements</a>. To help spur redevelopment in all parts of the city, the length of the tax abatement is largely determined by the location of the project. For instance, tax breaks for development in the coveted downtown area last only five years. Meanwhile, in areas where development has not yet taken a firm hold, such as Journal Square, Bergen-Lafayette and Greenville, tax abatements can last for up to 30 years.  Jersey City’s tax abatement policy also requires developers to meet other criteria in order to take advantage of the program, such as employing local workers and making payments to the Affordable Housing Trust.</p><p>For a large project, a tax abatement agreement can result in millions of dollars in abated taxes over the life of the agreement. To maximize the savings, it is imperative to work with experienced counsel who understands the abatement process and can negotiate the most beneficial tax agreement in your favor.</p>",,20150821,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/the-tax-abatement-process-in-jersey-city-nj-the-basics/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/JCwater.jpg,JCwater,,"Developers are now flocking to Jersey City, with large projects underway both on the waterfront and in the revitalized downtown area.",,,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate>Tax Abatement",,publish,15,the-tax-abatement-process-in-jersey-city-nj-the-basics,,,0,0,closed,open

16434,"Law Journal Interviews","ERISA plan administrators must affirmatively specify any contractual time limits that might bar judicial review of a claim denial. In Mirza v. Insurance Administration of America, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that any effort to shorten normal statutory limitations on judicial review must be noted in the denial letter to be effective. 

In an article published in the New Jersey Law Journal, Scarinci Hollenbeck partner Gary Young, a renowned ERISA plan lawyer whose career spans four decades, explained the impact of the Court’s ruling: “The ruling has the potential to ‘open the floodgates’ for claimants’ cases that otherwise would have been dismissed as time-barred.” Young believes that the decision is an attempt to reinforce the remedial and equitable purposes of ERISA. He further opined that the ruling injected a substantive due process requirement to any attempt at limiting claims, given the current status of health insurance and healthcare in the U.S.

“[All b]enefit plan administrators would be wise to start including litigation time limits in their denial letters,” Young added. “Without question, the Third Circuit is pretty influential regarding ERISA decisions” [and its decision must be respected even outside its jurisdiction].",,-00011130,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/?p=16434,,,,,,,"Firm News>Uncategorized",,draft,50,,,,0,0,closed,open

The decade-long, steadily increasing rise of <strong>wage-violation lawsuits by restaurant workers against their employers</strong> that has been making headlines was recently discussed in an article written by <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/gary-s-young/"">Scarinci Hollenbeck partner Gary Young</a>, published in the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association’s (NJHRA’s) newsletter. In this article, Mr. Young, a prominent business and labor law attorney, discusses how wage violation lawsuits have been on the rise for more than a decade and that the trend towards such suits increases every year.

“Wage and hour laws are inherently complex, which is why many employers fail to understand and properly apply them,” Mr. Young explained. He continued, “By way of just one example, the laws concerning tipped employees are of particular concern to employers,” he continued. “Restaurants often hire ‘tipped employees’ – and if they fail to legally compensate such employees in any material aspect, this can potentially cause the whole pay regime to fail and expose the employer to a far greater downside than may be understood.”  He explained how this aspect of the law gives plaintiff’s lawyers the incentive to sue restaurants.

“The law in New Jersey is that if tips make up the difference in pay to meet the minimum wage and a compliance failure is found, the payment owed by the employer to all affected tipped employees escalates from $2.13/hour to the current minimum wage of $8.38.” <span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">This, of course, could have devastating financial consequences for the employer. In addition, New Jersey law allows plaintiffs to sue for back pay if the non-compliance is found to be intentional. If penalties and attorneys’ fees were added on, the total damages could be catastrophic. Not only would the restaurant be exposed to liability, but supervisors who participated in decisions leading to such pay failures could be held personally liable.</span>

According to Mr. Young, other common employer breaches include, but are by no means limited to, failing to keep track of all hours worked working “off the clock” and the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. He emphasized that “The many damaging impacts of non-compliance underscore the fact that employers need to know the law and properly apply it – and that ignorance of the law is no excuse.”

In the case, Allwood brought suit under the New Jersey Spill Act, as well as under principles of strict liability and for breach of lease, against its dry cleaner tenant, Jogam Corp. Allwood asserted that Jogam had contaminated, <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-jersey-environmental-law-alert-dont-expect-an-alleged-prior-toxic-dumper-to-bail-you-out/"" target=""_blank"">the soil and groundwater on its property with PCE</a>, a dry cleaning chemical, as well as with related solvents. Allwood sought to hold  Jogam liable for all cleanup costs. It also asked the Court for an injunction ordering Jogam immediately to investigate and remediate the contamination. Jogam denied liability and asserted a contribution claim against Allwood under the Spill Act.  At trial, however, Jogam failed to establish that either Allwood or Jogam’s predecessors on the property had actually discharged any hazardous substances. Superior Court Judge Thomas LaConte accordingly issued an injunction against Jogam, ordering it to remediate Allwood’s property. The court further ruled in favor of Allwood, awarding it $800,000 in attorneys’ and consultants’ fees and costs. Defendant Jogam appealed to the Appellate Division, but the court affirmed the trial judge’s decision in all respects.

As Mr. Scagnelli explained: “The Allwood case is important because it confirms that under the Spill Act and common law, a party must show actual discharges of hazardous substances in order to obtain damages and injunctive relief.”

Demarquet was paid by the BOE for approximately two months following her termination, and thereafter filed a lawsuit, claiming that her firing was based on political retaliation. In her suit, she alleged civil rights violations, conspiracy and related causes of action against the Town, the Board of Education and the Mayor. After a contentious discovery period, the Court granted summary judgment on behalf of all defendants, noting that the Plaintiff did not present sufficient facts and evidence to support her political retaliation claims and that the Plaintiff's argument contained numerous hearsay, opinions, and speculations which were all excluded as evidence.

According to <a href=""/attorneys/robert-e-levy"">Robert E. Levy, head of litigation </a>at the Firm,  “The case was well briefed and argued.  It involved unique areas of law such as adverse inferences from exercising 5th amendment privilege, hearsay contained in public records and reports as well as dual entity liability in employment matters. Kudos to Fran Barto who did a terrific job on the brief.”

According to Fran Barto, litigation associate, “After extensive briefing and passionate oral argument from both sides, Judge Jablonski correctly decided that all of the Plaintiff’s proposed evidence was inadmissible. This case goes to show that the Town of West New York is ready, willing and able to fight and prevail against meritless lawsuits.”

In an official statement, Mayor Roque said “This is a win for the hard working tax payers of West New York.” said Mayor Roque. “The town will not be held hostage by individuals seeking to line their pockets by filing frivolous lawsuits against it. This case demonstrates that the town will vigorously defend against any and all such claims.” Mayor Roque went on to thank the attorneys at Scarinci Hollenbeck for their <a href=""http://hudsoncountyview.com/judge-dismisses-political-retaliation-suit-against-west-new-york-mayor-roque/"" target=""_blank"">good work in defending the town</a>.

16625,"NL Industries v. State of New Jersey Spill Act Decision","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Legal Update: New Jersey Spill Act Decision</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>
The State of New Jersey can no longer assert that it should be exempt from liability under <a href=""/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/New_Jersey_Spill_Act.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11, et seq.</a> (“Spill Act”),</strong> based on a decision by the New Jersey Superior Court, Middlesex County in <u>NL Industries v. State of New</u> <u>Jersey</u>, Docket No. L-1296-14, affirmed by the Appellate Division this week (Docket No. A-0869-1413). In this case, Plaintiff NL Industries filed a complaint against the State seeking contribution under the Spill Act for cleanup costs associated with remediating contamination resulting from the construction of a sea wall and jetty at the Laurence Harbor shoreline in Old Bridge Township. The complaint alleged that the State, in <img class=""alignright wp-image-16635"" style=""padding-left: 10px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/New-Jersey-Spill-Act.jpg"" alt=""Important legal updates to the NJ Spill Act: The State can no longer assert exemption from liability under the New Jersey Spill Act"" width=""579"" height=""266"" />accordance with its regulatory jurisdiction, approved the construction of a sea wall incorporating the use of heavy metal slag materials which ultimately caused or contributed to lead contamination for which the estimated cost of remediation was likely to exceed $75 million dollars. The State moved to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Spill Act did not retroactively abrogate sovereign immunity, i.e., that they should not be held liable for any offending action or omission (in this case, lead contamination) that occurred prior to the enactment of the Spill Act in 1977 and that the N.J. Tort Claims Act requirements applied before the Spill Act liability could be imposed on the State.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In denying the State’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff NL Industries’ Complaint, Superior Court Judge Wolfson ruled that since the Spill Act’s definition of a “person” subject to the provisions of the Act expressly included the State of New Jersey, and because Spill Act liability extends to any person “who is in any way responsible” for discharging a hazardous substance, and granted a right of contribution against “persons who are in any way responsible” for discharging a hazardous substance,  it would be illogical to exclude the State from Spill Act liability. Judge Wolfson further ruled that the N.J. Tort Claims Act requirements did not apply to the State’s liability under the Spill Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Given this ruling, we can expect Plaintiffs and other parties involved in Spill Act litigation will be looking for opportunities to add the State as a party in their cases in appropriate situations.</p>

16760,"Superstorm Sandy Suit Settlements","With the three-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy approaching, nearly 73 percent of storm-related lawsuits have been settled. Although big-dollar claims may still be brought by policy-holders who previously attempted to negotiate out of court, the extra judicial attention given to claims by the state court has helped to move cases along. Based on instructions by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, trial courts expedited Sandy cases through various administrative measures.

This was helpful in moving things along in the courts, according to &lt;a href=""/attorneys/charles-a-yuen""&gt;Charles Yuen&lt;/a&gt;, Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner and Chair of the firm’s policyholder-oriented &lt;a href=""/practices/insurance-recovery-liability/""&gt;Insurance Recovery and Liability Group&lt;/a&gt;.

16796,"New Guidelines in the National Labor Relations Act","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) promulgated new guidelines regarding Section 7 and Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On March 18, 2015, The National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) promulgated new guidelines regarding Section 7 and Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act. These sections ensure that employees can discuss unfair or illegal practices with other employees or third parties. Particularly focusing on blanket prohibitions and compulsions, the NLRB General Counsel’s Memo on Handbook Rules (the “NLRB Memo”) addressed:<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-16802"" style=""padding-left: 10px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nlrb-sm.png"" alt=""National Labor Relations Act"" width=""400"" height=""398"" /></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">
	<li>Confidentiality,</li>
	<li>Conduct toward Employer,</li>
	<li>Communication with Outside Parties,</li>
	<li>Protection of Intellectual Property,</li>
	<li>Leaving Work at Unauthorized Times, and</li>
	<li>Conflict of Interest Rules.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most employee handbooks contain these provisions. However, most handbooks do not demonstrate the nuance the NLRB now requires. For example, an employer cannot state, “Company logos and trademarks may not be used without written consent.” Rather the employer should state:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Respect all copyright and other intellectual property laws. For [the Employer's] protection as well as your own, it is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing copyright, fair use of copyrighted material owned by others, trademarks and other intellectual property, including [the Employer's] own copyrights, trademarks and brands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This more detailed approach provides employees a clearer understanding of an employer’s intentions and the employee’s rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The NLRB Memo emphasizes that the more general the provision, the more scrutiny it will encounter. Simply stating “Employees may not leave work at unauthorized times;” “Employees may not solicit other employees or distribute literature;” or “Be respectful of others and the Company” is no longer proper because such statements are too broad in scope. That is, while an employer’s intention may be valid, employees might think that they cannot take action that they could lawfully take.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recently, the NLRB determined in a 2-1 decision that a blanket confidentiality agreement contained in Boeing’s handbook violated the Section 7 rights of its employees. Making the decision worrisome for most employers is the extent that the NLRB determined the clause invalid. Boeing had previously changed the confidentiality clause from mandatory language to suggestive language. It no longer “required” but “recommended” that an employee not discuss confidential information. The NLRB found this suggestion to be contextually identical to a mandatory provision, concluding that employees were not truly free to disagree with the recommendation. Thus, the NLRB’s policy shift is not a matter of changing tone. Instead, the NLRB Memo seeks a more nuanced drafting of prohibitions and compulsions to strike a clear balance between employer and employee rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The broader effect of this ruling is still uncertain. However, it shows that the NLRB is enforcing the new guidelines. Because most employee handbooks probably contain these overbroad restrictions, we recommend employers review or revise their handbooks to protect their interests without infringing on their employees’ rights.</p>

16853,"What is Cyber Security? It Starts With Cryptology","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The mathematical basis for all cyber security is cryptology, the study of the hidden.</h2>
Cryptology provides the means to keep<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security""> electronic information secure by protecting the electronic system as a whole</a>, and by securing individual pieces of information (“bit”), even if the system itself is compromised. However, the Achilles heel to all data protection methods is that none is mathematically perfect. That is, no protection algorithm, even removing the computer from an Internet connection, guarantees data security.

<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cyber-security.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-16855 alignright"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cyber-security.jpg"" alt=""The mathematical basis for all cyber security is cryptology, the study of the hidden."" width=""555"" height=""259"" /></a>Encryption is an element of cryptography. <a href=""http://www.igi-global.com/book/applied-cryptography-cyber-security-defense/41746"">Cryptography is the most utilized method of data security </a>and the primary focus of this series. At a basic level, encryption is easy to understand. It is just the process of using a cypher.

For example, if I want to exchange a written note with someone, but I don’t want others to be able to read it, I will use a cypher. Let’s say that I want to send my classmate a message, “This class is boring.” My classmate and I agree on the method that every letter in the message will be moved one letter over in the alphabet and “z” will be “a.” This is called the encryption “key.” So the message would read, “Sijt dmbtt jt cpsjoh.” Because my classmate also knows the key, he can decypher the message, and, no doubt, promptly agree.

This is a “symmetric-key algorithm,” because both my classmate and I must know the same key in order to use the cypher. Computer networks generally find this system completely unfeasible, because one has to manage all of these private keys and remember what key belongs to what message. Moreover, the number of keys grows exponentially with the number of network members. So, only 100 network members requires 10,000 different keys, all of which must be kept secret and correctly assigned.

The “public-key algorithm” solves this problem by giving a user a “public key” and a “private key.” Anyone wishing to send a message would find a readily accessible public key and apply it to the message before sending it to a user. Thus, anyone who wants to send a user an encrypted message can do so. However, to decrypt the message that user needs to use his or her private key.

Beyond the obvious problem of someone stealing the private key in either scenario is the problem that someone can figure it out. If someone looks at the message I sent earlier, “Sijt dmbtt jt cpsjoh,” through a simple process of guess-and-check, one might figure out that all I did was move each letter over one spot in the alphabet. Computers can perform a guess-and-check regime against encryption to “crack” the secret key. Therefore, to make the keys secure, computer encryption relies on “mathematical hardness,” or that the math involved to crack the key is so involved that not even a supercomputer, working at the problem for years, can crack it.

This is the<a href=""http://cybersecurity.ieee.org/center-for-secure-design/use-cryptography-correctly.html""> basic idea behind encryption and keeping data secure</a>. However, any method, including those not discussed here, has either mathematical weaknesses or practical weaknesses. In short, no system is truly secure. The consequences can be devastating. However, good practice and knowledge of both lawful protections and lawful remedies can minimize risk and maximize efficiency for operating in an ever-increasing digital world.

16860,"Cyber Insecurity: Ashley Madison Encrypted Passwords Cracked","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">By now most people know that the extra-marital affairs website, Ashley Madison, was hacked, and its data posted to the Internet.</h2><p>This included the passwords to all accounts. However, the site had secured them using a hashing algorithm so slow and mathematically demanding that even those with the most sophisticated computers did not bother trying to crack them. One security expert who did try could only crack .0668% of the passwords, and those only because they were weak.</p><p>Surprisingly, a group of amateurs recently announced that they had cracked over 11 million of these passwords. Anticipating 15 million shortly, this represents about 41.7% of all the passwords. The key to their success wasn’t a supercomputer, or the soon-to-be quantum computer, but rather a security flaw making these particular 15 million passwords, in the estimate of one cracker, about one million times faster to crack.</p><p>The crackers exploited one of two flaws because an MD5 hashing method, considered weak by most experts, secured the passwords. Unlike the rest of the passwords, which a better but slower hashing secured, these used the faster but more vulnerable MD5 method. Cracking these is the cyber equivalent of getting Al Capone on tax evasion and not murder or racketeering.</p><p><strong>It seems that Ashely Madison was generally aware of this flaw</strong> because it could have rehashed the unsecured passwords but didn’t. <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/ashley-madison-passwords-like-thisiswrong-tap-cheaters-guilt-and-denial/"">One of the team cracking the passwords told Ars Technica</a>, “We can only guess at the reason the [hash] value was not regenerated for all accounts. [Perhaps], the company did not want to take the chance of slowing down their site while the [hash] value was updated for all 36+ million accounts.”</p><p>The cracking of these passwords demonstrates two important points. As always, it is necessary to have at least a moderately strong password. Even the best security algorithms cannot truly protect weak passwords. Also, even if the currently used encryption method is highly secure, artifacts or other parts of a system with less security can still be compromised. Further, there is a real danger of a snowball effect. That is, once crackers expose the weak parts of an encryption, they can use the information gained from those cracks to compromise better encryption elsewhere.</p><p>In a situation like this, where Ashley Madison engineers seemed aware of the problem but chose not to correct it for efficiency purposes, the aggrieved users of the site could assert claims of gross negligence in a class action setting. The facts and circumstances of this incident make that unlikely. However, were the site more innocuous, that threat would be real.</p><p><strong style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Related Article:</strong><br /> <a href=""/what-is-cyber-security-it-starts-with-cryptology/"">What is Cyber Security?

16896,"A Look at Jersey City’s Latest Tax Abatement Policy","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Jersey City Mayor Stephen Fulop recently unveiled several important revisions to the city’s popular tax abatement policy.</h2><p>The latest changes reflect a new, comprehensive housing policy objective that seeks to distribute more evenly the benefits of the unprecedented wave of development now taking place in parts of the city.</p><p>Shortly after taking office in 2013, Mayor Fulop first <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/the-tax-abatement-process-in-jersey-city-nj-the-basics/"">revised Jersey City’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) program</a>. The centerpiece of the revamped PILOT program was a tiered-system under which the terms of available tax abatements (most notably the length of the abatement) are largely determined by the location of the project.</p><p>The latest iteration of Jersey City’s tax abatement policy retains the tiered structure, while making minor tweaks to the policy. As <a href=""http://jerseycitygrows.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Executive-Order-2015-007-Tax-Abatement-Policy.pdf"">set forth in Executive Order 2015-007</a>, the revised program is intended to build on the success of the current PILOT program and instill greater transparency, objectivity, uniformity and predictability and to better employ the program’s incentives to meet the city’s strategic goals.  Notably, the revised tax abatement revolves around a new tier map. The first three tiers incorporate the latest income data gathered by the city, while the expanded f<a href=""http://jerseycitygrows.org/jersey-city-tax-abatement-tier-map/"">ourth tier includes areas in the city most in need of development. </a></p><p>In an effort to leverage the economic activity that is taking place in Jersey City, the amended tax abatement policy includes new affordable housing requirements and incentives. In the most sought after Tier 1, developers seeking abatements are required to set aside 10 percent of the total number of units for moderate-income housing, which is defined as housing available to households earning at or below 80 percent of the area median income. Alternatively, developers can make a contribution to the city's affordable housing trust fund. Developers in the other tiers can further extend their tax-abatement terms by up to ten years by committing to construct affordable units or by making a voluntary contribution to the affordable trust fund.</p><p>Under the new tax abatement policy, the annual service charges increased slightly. Below is a brief summary of the new service charge levels <a href=""http://jerseycitygrows.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jersey-City-Housing-Plan.pdf"">provided by Jersey City</a>:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tax Tier </strong></td><td><strong>Term </strong></td><td><strong>Annual City Service Charge</strong></td><td><strong>Annual County Service Charge </strong></td><td><strong>Administrative Cost Charge </strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tier 1 </strong></td><td>10 years</td><td>13% annual gross revenues</td><td>5% of annual City service charge</td><td>2% of annual City service charge</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tier 2 </strong></td><td>10 years</td><td>12% annual gross revenues</td><td>5% of annual City service charge</td><td>2% of annual City service charge</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tier 3 </strong></td><td>20 years</td><td>11% annual gross revenues</td><td>5% of annual City service charge</td><td>2% of annual City service charge</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tier 4 </strong></td><td>30 years</td><td>10% annual gross revenues</td><td>5% of annual City service charge</td><td>2% of annual City service charge</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The revised policies and procedures apply to future long term PILOTs and related financial agreements.

16971,"Good News For Small Businesses: The Affordable Care Act May See Minor Changes","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Five years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act is still undergoing minor tweaks. The latest change is good news for small businesses.</h2>

The latest change is good news for small businesses."" width=""373"" height=""270"" /></a>Earlier this month, President Barak Obama <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1624/text"">signed the “Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act of 2015,”</a> otherwise known as the PACE Act. The new law redefines the term “small” employers with respect to determining whether employers must provide health coverage for their employees within the Affordable Care Act.</p>
Under most state laws, employers with one to 50 employees are considered small employers, while employers with 51 to 100 employees are considered large employers. The Affordable Care Act deviated from this standard by categorizing employers with 51 to 100 employees as small employers. However, prior January 1, 2016, states had the option to continue to treat them as large employers.

The definition is <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/department-of-labor-issues-aca-compliance-checklist-for-group-health-plans/"">important for Affordable Care Act compliance</a> because large and small employers are treated very differently under the Affordable Care Act. Health insurance offered in the small group market must meet certain requirements that do not apply to the large group market, including the requirement to cover ten “essential health benefits” and provide plans that plans that fall into the actuarial value levels (platinum, gold, silver, and bronze) established by the Affordable Care Act. These requirements, along with several others, have made purchasing insurance more costly for small employers.

The PACE Act curtails the expansion of the definition of “small employer” under the Affordable Care Act.Instead, it authorizes states to define the small employer market within their jurisdiction for employers of up to 100 individuals. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new law will result in a net reduction in health premiums for insurance purchased by firms with between 51 and 100 employees.

Most states, including New Jersey, elected to delay the expansion of the definition of “small employer” through 2016. Accordingly, the state is expected to continue to define small employers as those with less than 50 workers. The path forward for states like New York, which already adopted the expanded definition, is less clear.

17001,"Does the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act Come at A Cost?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">On October 27, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), which is intended to address the increasing number of corporate data breaches.</h2>
However, critics of the <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754"">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a> contend that the lack of privacy protections opens the door for wide scale government surveillance.

<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cybersecurity-Information-Sharing-Act.png""><img class="" wp-image-17010 alignright"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cybersecurity-Information-Sharing-Act-300x140.png"" alt=""On October 27, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), which is intended to address the increasing number of corporate data breaches."" width=""517"" height=""241"" /></a>The <strong>stated goal of Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</strong> is to promote information sharing regarding cyber threats impacting the private sector. Under the proposed legislation, federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, will alert businesses about potential threats. At the same time, businesses will share information about cyberattacks or data intrusions. Companies that participate in the program would be shielded from liability for violating privacy-protection or antitrust laws.

Civil liberties groups, privacy advocates, and technology companies, including<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/26/technology/cisa-cybersecurity-bill-senate/""> Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, vehemently oppose Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act in its current form</a>. They maintain that the law fails to sufficiently protect users’ privacy or appropriately restrict how the federal government can use the information it receives. “The trust of our customers means everything to us and we don't believe security should come at the expense of their privacy,"" Apple wrote in a statement to the Washington Post.

Civil liberties groups are also concerned that corporations who participate in the program may not safeguard their customers’ privacy. “The incentive and the framework it creates is for companies to quickly and massively collect user information and ship it to the government,” according to Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “As soon as you do, you obtain broad immunity, even if you’ve violated privacy law.”

On the other side, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act supporters argue that the statute will not be used to enable government surveillance, and is a necessary tool to stem the growing tide of corporate data breaches. They note that the program will technically be voluntary and that companies are required to remove personally identifiable information from any data shared with the government.

“I still say today to those folks in this institution and outside this institution that are concerned with privacy, I think [Senator Dianne Feinstein] and I have bent over backwards to accommodate concerns,” Senate Intelligence Committee chair Richard Burr stated during the Senate debate. “Some concerns still exist. We don’t believe they’re necessarily accurate, and only by utilizing this system will we understand if we’ve been deficient anywhere.”

The Senate passed Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act by a vote of 74 to 21 without addressing the privacy concerns, and the House of Representatives passed a similar version of the legislation earlier this year. Therefore, it is likely that a compromise bill will be on the President’s desk soon. We will continue to track the status of the legislation and post updates as they become available.

17012,"No Tip? No Problem: NYC Restaurants Adopt New Business Model","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Although tipping has long been the norm for the U.S. restaurant industry, famed restaurateur Danny Meyer recently announced that all of the NYC Restaurants in the Union Square Hospitality Group will eliminate tipping by the end of the year.</h2>
The policy change will impact 11 notable NYC restaurants, including the Gramercy Tavern, The Modern, and Union Square Café, as well as the 1,800 tipped employees that work in such establishments.

<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NYC-Restaurants.png""><img class=""wp-image-17015 alignright"" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-top: -20px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NYC-Restaurants.png"" alt=""Although tipping has long been the norm for the U.S. restaurant industry, famed restaurateur Danny Meyer recently announced that all of the NYC Restaurants in the Union Square Hospitality Group will eliminate tipping by the end of the year."" width=""587"" height=""274"" /></a>Although there are a number of factors driving this no-tipping business decision, New York’s end-of-the-year tipped employee minimum wage hike from $5 to $7.50 is undoubtedly a major factor. Although many servers at high-end NYC restaurants earn substantial money as tips, little of this will count towards the employer’s responsibility to compensate, even though the tip credit has been an ingrained element of restaurant economics. Restaurant owners also face anticipated increases in the minimum wage for fast-food workers up to $15 an hour, which may tempt kitchen staff to seek higher paid positions at those establishments.

For restaurant owners, eliminating tipping arguably offers a number of advantages. For one thing, it makes <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">employment law compliance and record keeping</a> much less complex. Rather than navigating a dizzying maze of local, state and federal wage regulations applicable to tipped employees, members of the wait staff would be treated like all other non-exempt, hourly workers.

Mr. Meyers further explained that, by raising menu charges for food and beverage to include a service component, the employer is able to reallocate total revenue to narrow the earnings gap between those who make the food and those who serve it. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, gratuities paid to servers cannot be shared with non-tipped employees, such as kitchen staff. “The gap between what the kitchen and dining room workers make has grown by leaps and bounds,” <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/dining/danny-meyer-restaurants-no-tips.html"">Meyer told the <em>New York Times</em></a>. During his 30-year career in the NYC restaurant industry, “kitchen income has gone up no more than 25 percent. Meanwhile, dining room pay has gone up 200 percent,” he added.

For wait staff, the response is largely mixed. Some would prefer to earn a predictable wage, which eliminates the fear that a slow night can result in a low paycheck. However, other servers are wary that no-tipping policies will eliminate the “upside” income opportunity that comes with big tips for good service.

There are different variations of a no-tipping policy. For instance, Dirt Candy, which is located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, adds an “administrative fee” of 20 percent to each check. Under the law, if proper legal notice is provided, this is not a “tip” which is defined to be a “voluntary payment made by the patron to the server.” Whatever the name, an imposed service charge is a tip and can be credited to meet the employer’s minimum wage obligations (some jurisdictions will not permit a reallocation of the service charge to pay other employees however). Dirt Candy’s fee helps cover the $15/per hour the restaurant pays its waiters, waitresses, and bar staff. Other eateries are experimenting with raising food prices and imposing other types of services charges.

In the end, Mr. Meyer’s bold move will certainly warrant close attention by the restaurant industry, both inside and outside of the New York City metropolitan area. A crucial factor for success will be whether customers are willing to pay higher prices in exchange for eliminating the need to tip. NYC Restaurants would face potentially higher withholding tax obligations and would no longer be eligible to claim the favorable FICA tip credit. It also remains to be seen whether employees will be willing to work at an establishment which offers higher hourly rates that does not match the potential upside offered by tips.

Government secrets, medical records, financial, and personal information, previously kept safe through encryption, would be freely available.

The quantum computer differs from a classical computer in how its “bits” work. A bit is the smallest amount of information a computer can process. What makes the world “digital” is that these bits are the familiar ones and zeroes. Thus, the smallest amount of information a classical computer can process is either a 1 or a 0. In the quantum computer, however, the smallest amount of information is a “qubit.” The qubit can be either 1 or 0, but it can also be 1 <em>and </em>0 simultaneously. While defying common sense and our usual logic, this is just a manifestation of “superposition” in quantum mechanics.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_IaVepNDT4"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
As mentioned in my post <a href=""/what-is-cyber-security-it-starts-with-cryptology/""><em>What is Cyber-Security</em>,</a> encryption relies on “mathematical hardness.” That is, all the information required to crack an encryption is available, but the math required to successfully utilize that information is so onerous that it would take classical computers far too long to crack. Currently, the best of these encryptions would take a supercomputer more than the age of the universe to crack. A quantum computer can use the superposition of its qubits to arrive at the correct answer within seconds, because it can effectively do every step of the cracking algorithm simultaneously—not one step after another. Therefore, the “mathematical hardness” of decryption will be completely meaningless.

While engendering concern, the quantum computer offers real opportunity. It expands computing thought and ability beyond <a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html"">Moore’s Law</a>, a necessary step as classical computers encounter the physical limitations of modern hardware. The director of Mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology expressed his excitement for the new innovations saying, “Everything in the field of quantum computing and cryptographic mathematics is wide open. There remain fundamental mathematical questions that affect the very nature of current and future cryptographic methods.” More on the <a href=""http://research.stevens.edu/post-quantum-cybersecurity"">mathematics required to make cyber security quantum-resistant</a>.

Although exciting to the mathematics community, security services are beginning to express their apprehension about the potential of such a machine. The NSA and its British counterpart GCHQ have already begun alerting the public to the threat of quantum computing, recommending that organizations update their algorithms to be quantum-resistant. However, because the quantum computer is not online, the legitimacy of quantum-resistant algorithms has yet to be tested. Further, because no system is currently threatened, it is unlikely that any organization would expend the large sums needed to upgrade their security.

Nonetheless, the looming threat of the quantum computer will materialize. When it does, every encryption it can crack, every expert on those encryption algorithms, and every company selling them will be as antiquated as the electronic typewriter.

17096,"NCAA Ban On Athletes Engaging In Fantasy Sports","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">If you have spent any time near a television this fall, you could not have missed an advertisement for FanDuel or DraftKings. These fantasy sports conglomerates have spent <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/sports/football/draftkings-fanduel-new-york-attorney-general-tells-fantasy-sites-to-stop-taking-bets-in-new-york.html?_r=0"">an estimated $100</a> million in advertising this season.</h2>
Their most obvious appeal to fans is the lucrative cash prizes that they offer. In fact, FanDuel's prize payouts should surpass $1 billion this year. Unfortunately, if you are a National Collegiate Athletic Association athlete, the opportunity to earn cash from the booming fantasy sports industry is enticing. More to the point, it also prohibited by the NCAA, even if it is legal.

<span class=""image_arrange""><img class=""wp-image-17099 alignnone"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fantasy-sports.png"" alt=""If you have spent any time near a television this fall, you could not have missed an advertisement for FanDuel or DraftKings. These fantasy sports conglomerates have spent an estimated $100 million in advertising this season."" width=""450"" height=""210"" /></span><strong>NCAA stakes out its own position on fantasy sports</strong>

In 2006, Congress passed a bill called the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act, which prohibits businesses from facilitating gambling via use of the Internet. For reasons best known to Congress, however, the law has a specific carve-out for daily fantasy sports that meet certain skill based requirements.

Undeterred by Congress’s approach, however, the NCAA has taken a different position. NCAA bylaws prohibit any form of gambling by coaches, athletes and staff members. In addition, the bylaws specifically <a href=""https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/bylawSearch?bylawSearchSubmit=viewHtml&amp;division=1&amp;textTerms=&amp;titleTerms=&amp;keyValue=19456&amp;reportType=NotMain&amp;adopted=0"" target=""_blank"">oppose all forms of sports wagering</a> by anyone. A letter sent by the NCAA to DraftKings and FanDuel last month stated that the daily fantasy sites undermine the integrity of sports contests and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/sports/ncaa-distances-itself-from-daily-fantasy-websites.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">jeopardize the welfare</a> of student-athletes. Last month, in Dallas, NCAA executive vice president of regulatory affairs Oliver Luck reminded college athletes and athletic directors that participating in fantasy leagues violates NCAA rules, could cause an athlete to sit out an entire season, and could permanently <a href=""http://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/DI%20SAR%20Guidelines%20(June%202015).pdf"" target=""_blank"">endanger NCAA eligibility</a>.

College athletes do not seem fully aware of this. College football is booming in the daily fantasy sports market, growing at roughly the same rate as it is for NFL football. The opportunity to earn cash from one's own performance in the virtual game must be tempting to an NCAA athlete. A survey <a href=""http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/public/pdf/ncaa_wagering_prelim_may2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">conducted in 2013 by the NCAA</a> reports that an estimated 20 percent of NCAA athletes admit to participating in fantasy sports leagues and that more than 80 percent said they didn't realize that joining a paid fantasy league was an NCAA violation. As a result, the NCAA has asked FanDuel and DraftKings to stop <a target=""_blank"">offering fantasy games</a> based on college sports. This includes a concerted effort to prohibit the airing of fantasy sports-based advertising during NCAA televised performances.

<strong>NCAA joins the force for change regarding fantasy </strong><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law"" target=""_self""><b>sports law</b></a>

The NCAA is making an effort to move away from fantasy sports, especially fantasy leagues based on college athletics. Initially, the push back against fantasy sports operations was a state focus. Fantasy sports operations are specifically prohibited in Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Washington and now New York. In New Jersey lawmakers and professional sports leagues are currently butting heads about whether fantasy sports is a game of skill or chance. With the powerful NCAA defining fantasy sports as illegal gambling, operations such as FanDuel or DraftKings may have no choice but to stand down.",,20151112,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/general-practice/ncaa-ban-on-athletes-engaging-in-fantasy-sports/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fantasy-sports.png,fantasy-sports,,,"If you have spent any time near a television this fall, you could not have missed an advertisement for FanDuel or DraftKings.

17102,"Chief Compliance Officers Now Targeted For Data Breaches","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it clear that cybersecurity is a top priority. In a series of recent speeches, officials have focused attention on chief compliance officers and emphasized that chief compliance officers may be in the agency’s crosshairs when breaches occur.</h2>
As previously discussed on the Scarinci Hollenbeck's B<a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/"">usiness Law News Blog</a>, the SEC announced that it plans to conduct a <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/sec-announces-2015-exam-priorities/"">second round of cybersecurity compliance exams</a> in the near future. Issues of concern include governance and risk assessment, access rights and controls, data loss prevention, vendor management, training, and incident response.

In a series of recent speeches, officials have focused attention on chief compliance officers and emphasized that chief compliance officers may in the agency’s crosshairs when breaches occur."" width=""450"" height=""210"" /></a>In September, the SEC brought and settled charges against R.T. Jones Capital Equities Management. The agency alleged that the adviser failed to establish the required cybersecurity policies and procedures in advance of a breach that compromised the personally identifiable information of approximately 100,000 individuals. While financial firms will largely <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">face liability for cybersecurity compliance failures</a>, CCOs who shirk their duties could themselves also be on the receiving end of an enforcement action.

In remarks at the NRS 30th Annual Fall Investment Adviser and Broker-Dealer Compliance Conference, SEC Chief of Staff Andrew J. Donohue stated that the <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/donohue-nrs-30th-annual.html"">agency would continue to bring enforcement actions against compliance officers</a> when appropriate. He specifically highlighted that chief compliance officers that wholly fail to carry out their responsibility to implement compliance programs and policies, including those involving cybersecurity and data privacy, could face an SEC enforcement action. However, he also reiterated the agency’s position that the agency does “not bring cases based on second guessing compliance officers’ good faith judgments.”

In an October 16 speech, <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/white-regulation-of-private-fund-advisers-after-dodd-frank.html"">SEC Chair Mary Jo White further reiterated the importance of cybersecurity measures</a>, noting that advisers are encouraged to assess their “ability to prevent, detect and respond to attacks in light of their compliance obligations under the federal securities laws.” She further stated:
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cybersecurity is the shared responsibility of all regulators and market participants, including investment advisers, to guard the broader financial system against intrusions. While cybersecurity attacks cannot be entirely eliminated, it is incumbent upon private fund advisers to employ robust, state-of-the-art plans to prevent, detect, and respond to such intrusions.</p>
</blockquote>
The bottom-line is that chief compliance officers must be proactive when addressing cybersecurity. As a starting point, regulated financial firms should consult the <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/investment/im-guidance-2015-02.pdf"">SEC’s Cybersecurity Guidance issued earlier this year</a>. It advises that all firms should take the following compliance steps:

<span style=""&quot;margin-left: 15px;"">1.) Conduct a periodic assessment of: (1) the nature, sensitivity and location of information that the firm collects, processes and/or stores, and the technology systems it uses; (2) internal and external cybersecurity threats to and vulnerabilities of the firm’s information and technology systems; (3) security controls and processes currently in place; (4) the impact should the information or technology systems become compromised; and (5) the effectiveness of the governance structure for the management of cybersecurity risk. An effective assessment would assist in identifying potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities so as to better prioritize and mitigate risk.</span>

2.) Create a strategy that is designed to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. Such a strategy could include: (1) controlling access to various systems and data via management of user credentials, authentication and authorization methods, firewalls and/or perimeter defenses, tiered access to sensitive information and network resources, network segregation, and system hardening; (2) data encryption; (3) protecting against the loss or exfiltration of sensitive data by restricting the use of removable storage media and deploying software that monitors technology systems for unauthorized intrusions, the loss or exfiltration of sensitive data, or other unusual events; (4) data backup and retrieval; and (5) the development of an incident response plan. Routine testing of strategies could also enhance the effectiveness of any strategy.

Implement the strategy through written policies and procedures and training that provide guidance to officers and employees concerning applicable threats and measures to prevent, detect and respond to such threats, and that monitor compliance with cybersecurity policies and procedures. Firms may also wish to educate investors and clients about how to reduce their exposure to cyber security threats concerning their accounts.

17239,"How Will Faush v. Tuesday Morning Impact New Jersey Employers?","In a case that will impact the<a href=""/new-guidelines-national-labor-relations-act/""> hiring practices of New Jersey employers</a>, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently held that temporary workers can bring discrimination lawsuits against the companies that retain their services. The decision in <em>Faush v. Tuesday Morning</em> <a href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-3rd-circuit/1718709.html"">will not impact all temp workers,</a> but could result in liability in cases where the employer exerts a certain degree of control over the day-to-day activities of the employee.

The decision in Faush v. Tuesday Morning will not impact all temp workers, but could result in liability in cases where the employer exerts a certain degree of control over the day-to-day activities of the employee."" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 15px !important;"">The Facts of Faush v. Tuesday Morning</h2>
Plaintiff Matthew Faush, an African–American, is employed by Labor Ready, a staffing firm that provides temporary employees to several clients, including defendant Tuesday Morning, Inc. According to Faush, Labor Ready assigned him to work at one of Tuesday Morning's stores, where he was subjected to racial slurs and racially motivated accusations and was eventually terminated.

Faush <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">filed an employment discrimination suit</a> against Tuesday Morning, claiming violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, among other statutes. The District Court granted summary judgment to Tuesday Morning on the ground that, because Faush was not Tuesday Morning's employee, Tuesday Morning could not be liable for employment discrimination. The plaintiff appealed.
<h2 style=""margin-left: 15px !important;"">The Court’s Decision on Faush v. Tuesday Morning</h2>
The Third Circuit concluded that Tuesday Morning should be considered the plaintiff’s employer for the purposes of Title VII. In reaching its decision, the Third Circuit relied heavily on the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court holding in <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance v. Darden</em>, which established a multi-factor test for determining whether an employment relationship exists. As articulated by the appeals court, the primary factors include “which entity paid [the employees'] salaries, hired and fired them, and had control over their daily employment activities.”

With regard to how the plaintiff was paid, the Third Circuit highlighted that “although Tuesday Morning made its payments to Labor Ready, rather than to the temporary employees, those payments were functionally indistinguishable from direct employee compensation.”

The appeals court also noted that Tuesday Morning had control over hiring and firing. “If Tuesday Morning was unhappy with any temporary employee for any reason, it had the power to demand a replacement from Labor Ready and to prevent the ejected employee from returning to the store,” the panel noted.

In addition, as to control over the plaintiff’s day-day activities, the Third Circuit stated: “Tuesday Morning personnel gave Faush assignments, directly supervised him, provided site-specific training, furnished any equipment and materials necessary, and verified the number of hours he worked on a daily basis.”
<h2 style=""margin-left: 15px;"">The Message for New Jersey Employers</h2>
For New Jersey employees, the message is clear — hiring temporary workers will not shield you from liability from discrimination suits (and many other claims). For staffing agencies, the decision also highlights the need to educate clients and workers about the roles and responsibilities of all parties. Contracts should also clearly articulate the legal relationships.",,20151201,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/temporary-worker-can-bring-bias-suit/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Faush-v-Tuesday-Morning.png,Faush-v-Tuesday-Morning,,,"In a case that will impact the hiring practices of New Jersey employers, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently held that temporary workers can bring discrimination lawsuits against the companies that retain their services.

In the area of cybersecurity and data privacy, we saw new threats emerge as regulators and businesses struggle to keep pace.</h2>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17269"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cybersecurity_dataprotection100.jpg"" alt=""cybersecurity_dataprotection100"" width=""500"" height=""233"" /></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In case you missed some of our posts regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, below is a brief recap:</p>
<strong>Internet of Things</strong>: As the Internet of Things continues to grow, so do the associated security risks, including unauthorized access, misuse of personal information, and personal safety concerns. In 2015, the risks associated with “connected” cars took center stage with the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/top-cybersecurity-threats-unveiled-by-hackers-is-anyone-safe/"">much-publicized hack of the Jeep Grand Cherokee</a>. Due to a security flaw, hackers were able to remotely control the SUV via its UConnect entertainment system.

<strong>Government Coordination</strong>: The Obama Administration and Congress have both claimed that they made cybersecurity a top priority. Earlier in the year, the President signed an Executive Order <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/information-sharing-cybersecurity/"">intended to promote information sharing regarding cyber threats impacting the private sector</a>. Both chambers of Congress have passed versions of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), which is intended to address the growing number of corporate data breaches. However, critics of the controversial bill contend that the lack of privacy protections opens the door for wide scale government surveillance.

<strong>FTC Oversight: </strong>In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been increasingly bringing administrative actions under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act against companies that suffered data breaches due to allegedly deficient cybersecurity. In August, the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/ftc-cybersecurity-authority-is-affirmed/"">Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the agency’s cybersecurity authority</a>, which confirms that businesses should take the FTC seriously when it comes to data security.

<strong>Third-Party Vendor Vulnerability</strong>: Regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State Department of Financial Services, have recently raised concerns that <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/nydfs-surveys-reveals-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities/"">corporate cybersecurity policies and procedures fail to provide sufficient oversight of outside vendors</a> that often have access to secure networks and sensitive data. Hackers are also aware of such vulnerabilities and are using third parties to infiltrate their primary targets. Accordingly, it is imperative that businesses conduct sufficient due diligence regarding the privacy and data security measures adopted by third-parties vendors that have access to sensitive data.

<strong>Sophisticated Email Scams</strong>: The Business Email Compromise (BEC) scam, a sophisticated email scheme, has resulted in an estimated $1.2 billion in losses worldwide. In the United States, <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/fbi-bec-scams-result-in-1-2b-in-losses/"">scammers defrauded more than 7,000 companies</a> between October 2013 and August 2015. The fraud typically targets businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments. The perpetrators compromise legitimate business e-mail accounts by utilizing social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.

However, while consumer bankruptcy filings were up 5%, business Chapter 11 filings were up 30% on the same basis, from 298 Chapter 11 filings in November 2014 to 390 filings in November, 2015.

Nevertheless, the Wall Street Journal has just reported that the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-beige-book-reports-modest-growth-1449083069"">United States economy expanded at a modest pace in November 2015</a>, with a rise in consumer spending and the beginnings of increased demand for labor. According to the Fed, there was modest or stronger growth in 10 out of its 12 districts.

The reports from Epiq and from the Fed come amid anticipation that the <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm"">Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee</a> will begin the process of raising interest rates -- at or near zero for the past many years -- at the Committee’s December 15 meeting in Washington, DC. As Fed Chair Janet Yellen has noted, waiting too long to end the era of near-zero interest rates might result in the Fed tightening too quickly and causing market dislocations.

On the other hand, once the Fed begins tightening the screws on interest rates, it is entirely unclear what effect this will have on bankruptcy filings. Right now, there are plenty of credit facilities out there in the economy that can be handled relatively easily at current interest rates, but may become ever so much dicier at higher rates. Or, to mangle the metaphor, one can quote from the Sage of Omaha Warren Buffett:

<em>""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.""</em>

17309,"The Wyndham Data Breach Settlement Shakes Up Privacy Law","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made waves when it announced earlier this week that it reached a proposed settlement with Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (Wyndham).</h2>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17314"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Wyndham.jpg"" alt=""The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made waves when it announced earlier this week that it reached a proposed settlement with Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (Wyndham)."" width=""450"" height=""210"" /></p>
The agency’s enforcement action against Wyndham alleged that the company’s lax data security practices resulted in three separate consumer data breaches.

In defending the suit,Wyndham unsuccessfully challenged the FTC’s authority to police corporate cybersecurity practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). Under the terms of the settlement, Wyndham must obtain an independent auditor to verify that it has <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">established a comprehensive data security program</a> to protect cardholder data and conduct annual information security audits every year for the next 20 years.

<strong>FTC’s Authority under the FTC Act
</strong>

In recent years, the FTC has been increasingly bringing administrative actions against businesses that suffered data breaches due to allegedly deficient cybersecurity. When <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/ftc-data-breach-investigation/"">pursuing a data breach investigation</a>, the FTC relies on Section 5(a) of FTC Act, which prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” The statute broadly defines unfair practices as those that “cause or [are] likely to cause substantial injury to consumers…not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.”<strong>
</strong>

<strong>The Wyndham Lawsuit
</strong>

During 2008 and 2009, hackers breached Wyndham’s computer network on three separate occasions. In total, they stole personal and financial information for hundreds of thousands of consumers, which resulted in more than $10.6 million dollars in fraudulent charges.

The FTC filed suit under the FTC Act, alleging that Wyndham’s conduct was an unfair practice and that its privacy policy was deceptive. The FTC specifically maintained that contrary to Wyndham’s stated data privacy and security policy, the hotelier failed to employ encryption, firewalls, and other commercially reasonable methods for protecting consumer data. In defense of the suit, Wyndham argued that the FTC lacked the authority to regulate cybersecurity under the FTC Act.

In a precedential decision, the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/ftc-cybersecurity-authority-is-affirmed/"">Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the cybersecurity authority of the FTC</a> to impose liability for data breaches under Section 5 of the FTC Act. “A company does not act equitably when it publishes a privacy policy to attract customers who are concerned about data privacy, fails to make good on that promise by investing inadequate resources in cybersecurity, exposes its unsuspecting customers to substantial financial injury, and retains the profits of their business,” the panel wrote. The appeals court further held that Wyndham was on notice of the potential liability under the FTC Act, citing that the agency filed complaints and entered into consent decrees in administrative cases raising unfairness claims based on inadequate corporate cybersecurity prior to the company’s data breach.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>The Proposed Wyndham Data Breach Settlement
</strong>

Under the terms of the consent order, Wyndham must establish a comprehensive information security program t<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2015/12/wyndhams-settlement-ftc-what-it-means-businesses-consumers?utm_source=govdelivery"">o protect cardholder data and specifically address the risks arising from network connections</a> between Wyndham-branded hotels and the corporate data center. In addition, the company must conduct related annual information security audits every year for the next 20 years.

Wyndham must also obtain an annual independent assessment under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS. The independent third-party auditor must also certify that: Wyndham safeguards the connections with its franchisee hotels; Wyndham engages in a comprehensive risk assessment as laid out in the PCI-DSS risk assessment guidelines; and the auditor is truly independent from Wyndham.

“This settlement marks the end of a significant case in the FTC's efforts to protect consumers from the harm caused by unreasonable data security,"" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement. ""The court rulings in the case have affirmed the vital role the FTC plays in this important area.""<strong>
</strong>

<strong>The Message for Businesses
</strong>

Prior to the Wyndham lawsuit, challenges to FTC authority concerning privacy were very rare.  Most companies acquiesced when the FTC came knocking. However, Wyndham decided to challenge the FTC’s authority instead. After the Third Circuit confirmed the FTC’s authority to bring the suit, it appears that the company has since reassessed its strategy and decided to settle. This development is certainly remarkable and is likely to embolden the FTC in its quest to be the top federal privacy watchdog on consumer privacy issues within a federal statutory scheme that lacks a central regulatory body to handle such issues.

17318,"Making Sense of Holiday Tipping","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">During the holiday season, many of us like to say “thank you” to the professionals who provide services throughout the year.

While it is rewarding to spread holiday cheer, tipping/gifting can also be stressful when it comes to determining who to tip and how much to give. For instance, should the day care provider who takes care of your toddler get more than the delivery person who always brings packages around to the back door?

In addition to considering your own budgetary constraints, it is also important to note that some professionals are <a href=""http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22349/html/cover_025.htm"">legally prohibited from accepting tips and/or gift above a certain value</a>. For instance, under federal regulations, mail carriers are permitted to accept a gift worth $20 or less from a customer per occasion, such as Christmas. However, cash and cash equivalents, such as checks or gift cards that can be exchanged for cash, are prohibited in any amount.

Teachers are also <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/public-law/"">prohibited under state conflicts of interest laws</a> from accepting certain gifts. For instance, in New York City, teachers can only accept gift from a students if they are primarily sentimental in value, such as homemade crafts, cards, and baked goods.

Caregivers and others working for charitable and other institutions and organizations may be subject to a code of conduct in an employee handbook or elsewhere that provides for a limit on cash or value of gifts from consumers and their families served by the institution or organization. Before determining the amount of a holiday or other gift to staff, an inquiry ought to be made. As with many other things in life, the above rules are often honored in their breach.

As for considerations to take into account for tipping other professionals, below are <a href=""http://emilypost.com/advice/holiday-tipping-guide/"">some tips from Emily Post, the unofficial queen of etiquette</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Do you already tip regularly? If you tip at the time of service, you may forego an end of the year tip, or give a more modest holiday thank you. You may also choose to give a small gift instead.</li>
	<li>The quality and frequency of the service you receive.</li>
	<li>Your relationship with the service provider.</li>
	<li>Location: Tipping averages tend to be higher in larger cities.</li>
	<li>Length of service: The number of years you’ve been using the service.</li>
	<li>Regional customs.</li>
	<li>Type of establishment: Is it deluxe or moderate?</li>
</ul>
Post also suggests that any tip should be accompanied by a handwritten note of appreciation.",,20151210,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/general-practice/making-sense-of-holiday-tipping/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Holiday.jpg,"Making Sense of Holiday Tipping",,,"During the holiday season, many of us like to say “thank you” to the professionals who provide services throughout the year.

Donald Scarinci, <a href=""/attorneys/donald-scarinci/"">partner at Scarinci Hollenbeck</a>, will moderate a panel with James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who will appear in full period wardrobe and manner to create a real life experience. Their parts will be played by <a href=""http://www.billchrystal.com/hamilton-speaks.html"">William G.

Both men are scholars in their field and portray their character in an entertaining, informative and quite believable way.

“The Constitution of the United States was not written as a sacred text,” said Donald Scarinci. “It is a living document that derives its life and relevance from the great legal minds who have been selected as its custodians through the centuries.”

<img class=""size-thumbnail wp-image-14880 alignleft"" style=""margin-top: -25px; margin-bottom: -20px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cle-credits1-150x150.png"" alt=""cle-credits"" width=""150"" height=""150"" />James Madison will talk about his life as a lawyer and statesmen. He served as a member of the Confederation Congress and was a key organizer of the constitutional convention of 1787. After ratification he served as a member of the first House of Representatives and introduced the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Madison went on to serve as Secretary of State for Thomas Jefferson and became the fourth President of the United States in 1808.

Alexander Hamilton was a Colonel in George Washington’s continental army. He participated as a member of the Confederation Congress where he met James Madison. He was a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1787 and became a key proponent for ratification where he authored the Federalist Papers along with James Madison and John Jay. Hamilton became the first Secretary of the Treasury and a successful lawyer in New York. He was fatally wounded in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804.

“History portrays the founding fathers with God-like reverence. As attorneys we often attempt to interpret their understanding of the Constitution and we defer to them as authority. In reality, the founders were just ordinary people trying to cope with the day to day problems of life in 18th Century America,” Scarinci said.

17346,"Cyber Insecurity: The Dark Web","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is the Dark Web and why does it exist?</h2><p>The World Wide Web, with which most people are familiar, is generally referred to as the “Surface Web.” The name derives from the analogy of the Internet to an ocean. That is, the Surface Web is the ocean’s surface layers—visible, easily accessible, and where most life is. Thus, Internet search engines are the trawlers, casting wide nets across the surface layers. They then organize the results, presenting them to the consumer in a list with the most clicked links at the top. Beneath the Surface Web, however, there is the “Deep Web.” The Deep Web is everything on the Internet the search engines do not reach. The Deep Web is not shadowy or unfamiliar. Anyone with a Gmail account has interacted with the Deep Web, because emails are on the Internet but certainly not accessible by search engines.</p><p>The Dark Web is where people desiring anonymity post, share, and sell information. Importantly, not all of this activity is illicit, and an even smaller amount is immoral. Government dissents, whistle-blowers, and people who cannot use their public personae to voice an idea find solace in the Dark Web, as it can protect them from having their identities discovered.</p><p>Within this setting though, a market has developed for mostly illicit sales. As a general rule, when electronic data is stolen by non-governmental operatives, the Dark Web is the market where it is sold. Cracked PayPal, Netflix, Amazon, and other accounts are for sale. The more transactions a cracked account has, the more it will sell for. Uber accounts are in particularly high demand, as they can be used for free rides without giving away any information about the person who bought the illicit account. That a market exists is not unexpected, but startlingly the supply of this information is so extensive that purchasing cracked accounts is relatively cheap. Bank accounts with balances in excess of $500,000 go for $300-$500, a discount measured in orders of magnitude. Personal information is sold line by line, each line worth usually $1. Credit reports, scans of official documents, and even utility bills are also available for purchase.</p><p>Most of the illicit marketplaces of the web are accessible to anyone. A user needs only to connect to the desired network. These darknets, as they are called, are discrete areas of the Internet only accessible through special communication protocols, software, or authorizations. The most popular <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/"">darknet is the Tor Network,</a> also known as <a href=""http://www.onion-router.net/"">The Onion Network</a> (an allusion to its many layers). Without getting into the specifics of how Tor works, it suffices to say that Tor routs your Internet traffic through so many servers that it is almost impossible to trace, giving the user anonymity to carry out his or her online affairs within the network.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a></p>[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""559""]<a href=""http://www.deepwebtech.com/wp-content/uploads/DeepvsDarkIceberg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.deepwebtech.com/wp-content/uploads/DeepvsDarkIceberg.jpg"" alt=""The layers of the web: The Surface Web, The Deep Web, The Dark Web"" width=""559"" height=""419"" /></a> The layers of the web: The Surface Web, The Deep Web, The Dark Web[/caption]<p>The damage resulting from data breaches are usually impossible to quantify. To misquote a cold war veteran, “The loss of one person’s data is a tragedy; the loss of millions’ is a statistic.” Because the Dark Web is so easily accessible for anyone with the will to do so, it is surprising that its information is not more widely used for legitimate purposes. For example, in the weeks following a data breach, it is likely that at least a portion of the stolen data will appear on one of the Dark Web’s marketplaces. As these data breaches increase, the need for the courts to develop an analytical method to approximate damages will increase with it. Although in its infancy, companies are forming to provide this legwork. A breached entity can hire one of these companies to trawl the Dark Web to investigate the nature of any hacked data. Much like a sheriff would go to a local market to find stolen goods, so the investigators can go to a darknet market to find stolen data. As these companies become more established and more sophisticated, they will probably be used with increasing regularity as expert witnesses in data breach cases.</p><p>The Dark Web is neither good nor bad; it is just a tool. Situations arise where the anonymity of the Dark Web is important for achieving a good end, and there are situations where it is important for a bad end. Given the confidential nature and the pressing necessities that drive people to use the Dark Web, governmental or corporate entities will never truly succeed in monitoring it or shutting it down.

The <a href=""http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/flipbook/Cybersecurity_Trailblazers_2015/Cyber_Security_Trailblazers_2015_Web.html#p=20"">Cybersecurity &amp; Data Privacy Trailblazers award</a> recognizes legal professionals who “have moved the needle” and exemplified innovation in addressing novel data privacy and security legal issues posed by changing technologies. It is awarded to only 50 attorneys from the United States and abroad. <strong>Fernando M. Pinguelo is the only recipient from a New Jersey based law firm to receive the Trailblazer Award.</strong>

“We are thrilled that our firm achieved this recognition for our work in the cybersecurity and data privacy field,” said Scarinci Hollenbeck managing partner Ken Hollenbeck. “Fernando has worked hard to put us on the map and he and his team have helped us earn our reputation as one of the best in the field.”

Pinguelo, accredited as a Certified Information Privacy Professional by the <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/cyber-lawyer-fernando-pinguelo-earns-cipp-accreditation/"">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>, has been at the forefront of developments in the law triggered by rapidly evolving technologies since 2006 when, in the middle of a four-week trial, a witness unexpectedly revealed that certain data had “resurfaced.”
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With the help and experience of Fernando M. Pinguelo, Scarinci Hollenbeck is building a dextere and highly respected privacy and data security practice in this region.</p>
</blockquote>
“Dealing with a crisis like that required both a working knowledge of technology and creativity in applying longstanding legal and procedural principles to such a novel set of circumstances – in fact, the first of its kind in New Jersey at the time,” explained Pinguelo. “At that moment I recognized just how much of an impact electronic data can have on litigation, and began to appreciate how cyber security, data protection, and E-Discovery would emerge to become an integral part of legal and business landscapes.”

Since then, Pinguelo’s law practice has grown in size and technology sophistication with clients most often turning to him in <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/crisis-risk-management/"">crisis situations</a> where options are few and the risks high.  His numerous published articles and speaking engagements in his areas of practice reflect the depth of his knowledge and understanding of the issues that his clients face. Pinguelo also designed one of the first state-of-the-art electronic discovery law courses in the country, which he teaches at Seton Hall University School of Law.

Pinguelo’s practice includes international matters with a particular emphasis on Brazil. Fluent in Portuguese, he serves as U.S. national coordinating counsel for one of Brazil’s premier cyber law firms, Opice Blum, Bruno, Abrusio e Vainzof Advogados Associados. He has also <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/fernando-pinguelo-fulbright-specialist-mackenzie-university-sao-paulo-brazil/"">served as a visiting professor</a> at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie as part of his Fulbright Specialist appointment.

Pinguelo and his team regularly handle “crisis litigation,” including emergency applications before the courts, and represent individuals, businesses, and government agencies in developing and implementing data breach response and compliance programs related to the laws and standards that regulate the collection, use, sharing, storage and protection of personal and business data.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ken Hollenbeck noted, “<strong>With the help and experience of Fernando M.

17387,"FAST Act Eases Securities Compliance for Small Businesses","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">So, what is the FAST Act and how will it help with securities compliance when it comes to business?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On December 4, 2015, President Barak Obama signed the FAST Act (Fixing America’s Surface Transportation) into law. The transportation law is of particular interest to businesses because it also makes several important changes to the JOBS Act and other federal securities laws with the aim of lessening the legal obligations for small businesses.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17396"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FAST-Act.jpg"" alt=""So, what is the FAST Act and how will it help with securities compliances when it comes to business?"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
The key provisions of the FAST Act that<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/cf-announcement---fast-act.html?_sm_au_=iVVDvNn45FN0H131""> amend federal securities law</a> are summarized below:
<h3><strong>JOBS Act Changes for Emerging Growth Companies</strong></h3>
The FAST Act makes a number of changes that are intended to benefit emerging growth companies (EGCs), which are defined in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as issuers with “total annual gross revenues” of less than $1 billion during their most recently completed fiscal year. Under existing regulations, issuers were previously required to publicly file a registration statement and all previously submitted drafts no later than 21 days before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show. Section 71001 of the FAST Act shortens that period to 15 days. EGCs with initial public offerings pending before the FAST Act became law or at any time thereafter may take advantage of the provision. If an EGC does not conduct a road show, the non-public drafts must be filed at least 15 days before the effectiveness of the registration statement.

The FAST Act also creates a grace period for EGCs that cease to meet the legal definition. Under amendments to Section 6(e)(1), an issuer that qualifies as an EGC at the time it initiates the registration process, either by submitting a draft registration statement or by filing it publicly, but which subsequently ceases to be an EGC, will continue to be treated as an EGC until the earlier of the date on which the issuer “consummates its initial public offering . . . or the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date the company ceases to be an emerging growth company.”

Finally, the FAST Act amends the JOBS Act to allow EGCs to “omit financial information for historical periods otherwise required by Regulation S-X” if it “reasonably believes [the omitted information] will not be required to be included in the [filing] at the time of the contemplated offering,” so long as the issuer amends the registration statement prior to distributing a preliminary prospectus to include all financial information required at the time of the amendment. While the law states that the provision takes effect 30 days after enactment, the SEC has indicated that will not object if EGCs apply it immediately.
<h3><strong>Disclosure Changes for Form 10-K and Regulation S-K</strong></h3>
The FAST Act also <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/securities-offerings-and-corporate-disclosure/"">alters issuers’ disclosure obligations</a> under Form 10-K and Regulation S-K. Most notably, all issuers will be authorized to submit a summary page on Form 10-K, provided that each item on the summary page includes a cross reference to the material in the 10-K. The law advises that a hyperlink would be sufficient. However, the SEC must complete an official rulemaking to implement the changes.

With regard to Regulation S-K, the FAST Act requires the SEC to further streamline the requirements relating to EGCs, accelerated filers, smaller reporting companies and other smaller issuers, as well as “eliminate duplicative, overlapping, outdated or unnecessary provisions of Regulation S-K.” Going forward, the FAST Act also requires the SEC to study how the regulation’s disclosure obligations can be further modernized and simplified.
<h3><strong>Smaller Reporting Companies Incorporation by Reference</strong></h3>
The FAST Act makes it easier for smaller reporting companies, defined as entities that, as of the last business day of their second fiscal quarter have a public float of less than $75 million, to update their registration statements. Specifically, the SEC is directed to amend Form S-1 to allow smaller reporting companies to incorporate by reference in a registration statement on that form any documents that the company files after the effective date of the registration statement. This provision will also require an SEC rulemaking.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As part of the settlements, Accutest is paying $3 million to the U.S. Department of Justice and $2 million to NJDEP.

Yuen, Esq.[/caption]

Charles Yuen, a Partner and member of the <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">Scarinci Hollenbeck’s Litigation Practice Group</a> has been named Co-Executive Editor of the <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/publications/tort_insurance_law_journal_home.html"">American Bar Association’s Tort Trial and Insurance Law Journal</a> (ABA TIPS Journal) for the 2016-17 publishing year.  The light blue periodical features high quality law review articles from top lawyers in the country, presenting issues of critical importance and is a bookshelf fixture for the 30,000 lawyer members of one of the ABA’s largest sections.

Mr. Yuen’s managerial position involves working with the Journal’s editorial board, the article authors, the ABA TIPS Journal section committee leadership, and the employees of the ABA.  He has served on the editorial board since 2008. TIPS is the go-to source of knowledge of leadership on trial practice and critical issues of justice that involve tort and insurance law. The section is unique within the ABA and the legal community because of its focus on balance and diversity, as it brings together plaintiffs, defense, corporate and in-house counsel to discuss and examine issues confronting the practice of tort and insurance law.

At Scarinci Hollenbeck, Mr. Yuen is Chair of the firm’s policyholder-oriented <a href=""/practices/insurance-recovery-liability/"">Insurance Recovery and Liability Group.</a>  He has extensive experience in contract law and related disputes. He has worked on complex multijurisdictional corporate, commercial, construction, insurance and reinsurance coverage lawsuits as well as major cases involving alleged breaches of joint venture, executive employment, and franchise agreements.  Mr. Yuen’s work has also involved RICO, qui tam, hospital, privacy, ERISA, trademark, patent, environmental, professional, securities, commercial, regulatory, insolvency, and bankruptcy law and issues of damages and equitable relief, including temporary restraints and preliminary and permanent injunctions.  He has also defended corporations against product liability suits, including asbestos-related “mass tort” and property damage allegations.  He is familiar with and has analyzed all major types of insurance policies, including for example general and automobile liability; product liability; environmental liability; property; errors and omissions; directors and officers; maritime; fiduciary; employment; hospital; Bermuda form; title; fidelity; surety; umbrella; and excess.

Mr. Yuen regularly publishes articles and speaks on insurance-related topics.  A 1990 Columbia University Business Law Review article Mr. Yuen co-authored analyzed the history of key standard form wording in general liability policies.  The article has been cited and discussed by four U.S. state supreme courts (California, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Iowa).  Three of those courts unanimously adopted the position Mr. Yuen advocated.  The article has been, and continues to be, regularly cited and submitted by litigants to appellate courts across the U.S.

17451,"New York Adopts New Equal Pay Protections","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">New Equal Pay Protection Laws for Female Workers in New York Will Take Effect in a Few Days</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This fall, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a series of bills into law that will dramatically increase the equal pay and gender discrimination protections for female workers in the state. For New York employers, it is important to be aware that many of the changes under these laws become effective in the New Year. Further, it should be clear that Employers would be well advised to engage in a careful analysis of its equal pay practices and other policies to insure that all new requirements are addressed.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17455"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Equal-Pay.jpg"" alt=""New York Adopts New Equal Pay Protections"" width=""486"" height=""227"" /></p>
New York Labor Law (NYLL) § 194 will undergo the most substantive changes under the package of equal pay bills. The <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-protect-and-further-women-s-equality-new-york-state"">statute previously allowed employee pay differentials based</a> on “any other factor other than sex.” Under the amendment, differentials may be based upon “a bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience.” Employers must be prepared to affirmatively demonstrate that any such differential is job related and “consistent with business necessity.”

In addition, employers will not be able to rely on the “factor other than sex” defense if the employee can prove that:
<ul>
	<li>The employer’s practices cause a disparate impact on the basis of sex;</li>
	<li>An alternative employment practice would have served the same business purpose without disparate impact; and</li>
	<li>The employer refused to adopt the alternative practice.</li>
</ul>
Changes to the NYLL also address confidentiality provisions governing wages. Under the <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">revised New York employment law</a>, no employer may prohibit “an employee from inquiring about, discussing, or disclosing the wages of such employee or another employee.” However, businesses may place reasonable “limitations on the time, place and manner for inquiries about, discussion of, or the disclosure of wages.”

The equal pay revisions also make clear that equal pay analysis must include work in different locations by expanding the definition of “same establishment” to include “workplaces located in the same geographical region, no larger than a county.” Lastly, the amendments increase the cost of willfully violating the equal pay law by increasing liquidated damages liability to 300 percent of the total amount of wages owed.

Below is a brief review of several other key legal changes signed into law:
<table style=""width: 60%; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Sexual Harassment:</h3>
</td>
<td>One of the new laws expands the definition of “employer” to cover all employers within New York in sexual harassment cases. Previously, the definition of “employer” excluded businesses with fewer than four employees, thereby prohibiting individuals from filing harassment complaints with the Division of Human Rights against those employers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Pregnancy Discrimination:</h3>
</td>
<td>Under amendments the Human Rights Law, New York employers with four or more employees would be required to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees. The new law clarifies that employers must perform a reasonable accommodation analysis for employees with a “medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth that inhibits the exercise of a normal bodily function or is demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Family Status:</h3>
</td>
<td>Further amendments to the HRL add familial status as a protected characteristic. Accordingly, the law now prohibits employment agencies, licensing agencies, or labor organizations from discriminating against workers based on their familial status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Attorneys Fees:</h3>
</td>
<td>Finally, another bill signed into law allows successful plaintiffs to recover attorneys’ fees in employment or credit discrimination cases based on sex.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The new laws become effective on January 19, 2016. Accordingly, New York employers should review their policies and procedures to verify that they are in compliance and make any necessary changes as soon as possible.

Employees of the hospital filed suit under ERISA alleging that the St. Peter’s Healthcare System (St. Peter’s) violated the federal law by under-funding its employee retirement plan by over $70 million. St. Peter’s is a non-profit healthcare entity that operates several facilities. Although it is not a church, it has substantial ties to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen, New Jersey.

For more than three decades, St. Peter’s operated the retirement plan in compliance with ERISA. In 2006, it filed an application with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking a church plan exemption. Although the application signaled the belief of St. Peter’s Healthcare System that it qualified for an ERISA exemption, it continued to pay ERISA-mandated insurance premiums for the retirement plan while the application was pending.

In May 2013, Laurence Kaplan, a former St. Peter’s Healthcare System employee, filed a putative class action alleging that the hospital failed to comply with various ERISA obligations, including that the plan was significantly underfunded. In August 2013, while the lawsuit was pending, the IRS issued a private letter ruling affirming the plan’s status as an exempt church plan for tax purposes. St. Peter’s moved to dismiss the suit, claiming that it qualified for ERISA’s church plan exemption and therefore was not required to comply with the provisions Kaplan claimed it had violated. The District Court denied the motion after concluding that St. Peter’s could not establish an exempt church plan because it is not a church.

<strong>The Legal Background</strong><strong> of Kaplan v. St. Peter’s Healthcare System</strong>

Subsection 4(b)(2) of <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-corporate-transactions-and-business-law/"">ERISA establishes an exemption for church plans</a> under which plans need not comply with several of the law’s provisions, including fiduciary obligations and minimum-funding rules. ERISA defines a church plan as one that is “<strong>established and maintained</strong> [emphasis supplied] . . . for its employees (or their beneficiaries)” by a tax-exempt church. Subsection 3(33)(C)(i) clarifies that a “plan established and maintained” by a church includes a plan maintained by a qualifying agency of a church. The question before the Third Circuit is whether a church agency, in addition to maintaining an exempt church plan, must also establish such a plan?

<strong> </strong><strong>The Third Circuit’s Decision</strong><strong> on Kaplan v. St. Peter’s Healthcare System</strong>

The Third Circuit held that a church must <strong>establish</strong> a plan in order for it to qualify for a religious exemption under ERISA. “The plain terms of ERISA only make these exemptions available to plans established in the first instance by churches. Because St. Peter's is not a church, the exemption is not available, and it is not entitled to dismissal of Kaplan's complaint on that basis,"" Judge Thomas Ambro wrote on behalf of the appeals court.

In reaching its decision, the Third Circuit acknowledged that, under ERISA amendments enacted in 1980, plans maintained by church agencies may benefit from the religious exemption. However, it rejected the argument that the amendments removed the requirement that the plans must be initially created by a church.  The Court, while acknowledging the IRS ruling, rejected it despite the normal deference accorded the agencies charged with ERISA enforcement:

“But the IRS changed course in 1983 based on its interpretation of the 1980 amendments and began issuing exemptions to plans that were not established by churches. A 1983 IRS memorandum stated that because “religious orders can now have their employees covered by a church plan without a determination that such orders are churches, [an order's] nonchurch status is not fatal.” I.R.S. Gen. Couns. Mem. 39,007 (July 1, 1983). According to St. Peter's, the IRS has issued at least several hundred exemptions based on that reasoning. And, as discussed, St. Peter's itself received an exemption from the IRS in 2013, after this lawsuit was filed. St. Peter's also notes that the Department of Labor has issued several exemptions of its own based on the IRS' position.

However, because the IRS' position came in a general counsel memorandum and not as a result of “formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking,” its interpretation is owed deference “only to the extent that [it has] the power to persuade.” Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The IRS' 1983 memorandum lacks the power to persuade because it does not even consider the church establishment requirement of § 3(33)(A). Rather, it skips directly (and inexplicably) to § 3(33)(C). Because the IRS' position is at odds with the statutory text, we owe it no deference.”

The Third Circuit also rejected St. Peter’s Free Exercise claims, which maintained that if church agencies cannot establish their own plans, the IRS will be forced, in considering requests for exemptions, to determine on an individualized basis whether particular agencies are performing sufficiently religious functions such that they can themselves qualify as churches. “Churches and agencies can avoid this inquiry altogether by having a church establish the plan in the first instance,” the court noted.

The Third Circuit is the first to address whether only churches can establish exempt church plans. However, the Seventh Circuit considered the issue in September and is expected to release an opinion shortly.

It will be interesting to see whether this case ultimately goes up to the Supreme Court.  In this instance, the Third Circuit literally threw the opinion of the IRS “out the window” even though its position has been in existence since 1983 and relied upon by many others, including the U.S. Labor Department.  It cannot be doubted that the plight of the many plan participants with unfunded pensions and the protective and remedial purposes of ERISA swayed the Court in its determination.  The question remains whether this apparent balancing of the equities will be further tested and sustained?",,20160107,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/st-peters-healthcare-system-cant-rely-erisa-church-plan-exemption/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Saint-Peter’s-Healthcare-System.jpg,Saint-Peter’s-Healthcare-System,,,"The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently held that St. Peter’s Healthcare System could not rely the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) exemption for church plans.

17482,"Year in Review: Small Business Financing","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Small business financing is one of the greatest hurdles any entrepreneur must face.</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17488"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/small-business-financing.png"" alt=""Small business financing is one of the greatest hurdles any entrepreneur must face."" width=""600"" height=""280"" />In 2015, we discussed a number of ways that entrepreneurs can raise the capital needed to get their companies off the ground and help them grow. We also highlighted several new laws, such as the <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html"">Securities and Exchange Commission’s new equity crowdfunding rules</a>, that is intended to benefit small business financing. In case you missed any of the posts, below is a brief recap:</p>

<table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>SEC Crowdfunding Rules:</h3>
</td>
<td>On October 30, 2015, the<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/index.htm""> Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) adopted final rules to implement equity crowdfunding under Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). The much-anticipated rules are expected to be a game changer for startups and small businesses because it will allow them to raise money through smaller investments from a large number of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>State-level crowdfunding:</h3>
</td>
<td>While awaiting the SEC rules, more than 20 states legalized some form of equity crowdfunding at the local level. Most regulations allow entrepreneurs to solicit financing from investors who reside in the same state, subject to certain caps. Now that it has finalized its crowdfunding regulations, the SEC also proposed new rules intended to help facilitate intrastate and regional securities offerings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Friends and Family:</h3>
</td>
<td>When founders tap their own resources, friends and family can be a welcome source of capital for new ventures having difficulty securing loans or venture capital funds. Startups can often raise $50,000 to $500,000 and more through this type of financing. However, friends and family financing is not without its pitfalls, including the failure to formalize the arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Online Lending:</h3>
</td>
<td>Online lending is set to outpace more traditional financing methods. In 2015, 80 percent of small-business owners went online first to search for a loan, according to the latest statistics. While the Internet can help connect companies with lenders, as with more traditional loans, it is still imperative for small businesses to do their research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Regulation A+:</h3>
</td>
<td>Regulation A+, which took effect on June 29, 2015, is intended to provide small businesses with greater access to capital by expanding a little used exemption to SEC registration. Under the new regulations, businesses will be able to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities in a 12-month period, so long as they meet certain eligibility, disclosure and reporting requirements.</td>

17500,"Year in Review: Federal Employment Law Developments","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">In this past year (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court issued a number of important employment law decisions. Federal employment law agencies such as the Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) published rules and guidance that significantly impact employer compliance in a number of key areas.</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-17517 aligncenter"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/federal-employment-law.png"" alt=""In this past year (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court issued a number of important employment law decisions.

In many instances, these positions go way beyond “cutting edge” and transcend into unprecedented interpretation of the “law.” Circuit Courts have begun to sharply criticize such interpretations of federal employment lawand to overrule administrative positions, at times awarding significant attorneys’ fees to employers that were vindicated on the appellate level.

To avoid unintended legal exposure and liability, employers should be sure to stay updated on all of the legal changes that took place in 2015. Below is a brief review on the issues we covered on our blog:
<table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Sexual Orientation Discrimination:</h3>
</td>
<td>In a novel ruling, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sexual orientation employment discrimination in the workplace. Even though the courts have not yet sanctioned the EEOC’s position, the agency is likely to aggressively enforce its new interpretation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Overtime Rules:</h3>
</td>
<td>In July, the Department of Labor (DOL) published its highly anticipated proposals for updated overtime rules. The proposed rule would set the standard salary level at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings for full-time salaried workers ($921 per week, or $47,892 annually); increase the total annual compensation requirement needed to exempt highly compensated employees to the annualized value of the 90th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers ($122,148 annually); and establish a mechanism for automatically updating the salary and compensation levels going forward to ensure that they will continue to provide a useful and effective test for exemption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Worker Misclassification:</h3>
</td>
<td>This summer, the Department of Labor (DOL) also published guidance on worker misclassification in which the agency suggested that “most” independent contractors should be legally classified as employees. The DOL’s broad interpretation of “employee” under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) suggests that worker misclassification will continue to be a top compliance concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Religious Discrimination:</h3>
</td>
<td>In Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that an employer can be held liable for failing to accommodate a religious practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 even through the employee has not made an express request. Specifically, an applicant need only show that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer’s decision. The decision made it easier for employees to prove religious discrimination in the workplace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Pregnancy Discrimination:</h3>
</td>
<td>In Young v. UPS, the U.S. Supreme Court held that employees could establish a prima facie discrimination case under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act case by providing sufficient evidence that the employer’s policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers. Plaintiffs must also show that an employer’s ‘legitimate, nondiscriminatory’ reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify the burden, but rather—when considered along with the burden imposed—give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination. In the wake of the decision, the EEOC published revised guidance.</td>

17535,"What Is Business Triage? And Can It Help Your Start-Up?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Many business owners are familiar with the term “triage” in the medical setting, but do you know how the process of a business triage could help your company perform better?</h2>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17538"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/business-triage.jpg"" alt=""Many business owners are familiar with the term “triage” in the medical setting, but do you know how the process of a business triage could help your company perform better?"" width=""467"" height=""218"" /></p>
The word “triage” is derived from the French word “trier,” which means to separate or select. When hospitals triage patients, they rank and treat them in order of the severity of their conditions. In the business setting, a business triage involves the allocation of resources in the most effective way possible.

Triage is especially useful for small and growing businesses that have finite resources, particularly when it comes to both money and manpower. Triage also helps ensure that <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">business decisions are guided by critical thinking</a> rather than emotion. When small business owners are overwhelmed, it can be easy to make a knee-jerk decision rather than a logical one.

By way of example, consider a small business that suddenly discovers that sales have plummeted over the past several months. In order to cover expenses, the owners clearly must take steps to increase profits. But where to start? The easiest choice may be to secure a loan and worry about how to pay it back later. But that solution ignores the big picture and fails to address the underlying problem. In the medical setting, the decision would be akin to giving a patient heart medication, without determining what may be causing the symptoms.

The better solution is to triage the problem. Analyze all the aspects of the sales process to determine the potential issues that could be contributing to the sudden drop and then rank the potential solutions in terms of feasibility, cost, effect and time requirements. Often,  there is a short-term fix that can be implemented while the business focuses on large-scale projects. For instance, if poor online sales are part of the problem, decreasing high shipping costs for the customer may boost sales while the company works to improve the overall online shopping experience.

The concept of business triage is also effective when a start-up or other small company receives a sudden influx of cash. It forces businesses owners to analyze the big picture and critically consider where resources can do the most good in terms of <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/start-up-ready-to-hire-employees/"">hiring more employees</a>, launching a marketing campaign, working to develop a new product, etc. Of course, in order to make the most effective use of the triage process, you also need to collect data on key aspects of the company. Just like in the medical setting, it is much easier to make a logical and well-reasoned decision once you have all of the facts.

17542,"FDA Seeking to Define “Natural” for Food Labeling","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">As store shelves become crowded with products that feature food labeling purporting to be “natural,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is asking the public to weigh in on what the term means.</h2>
Consumer petitions asking that the FDA define the term “natural” for use in food labeling prompted the agency to take formal action. A <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm456090.htm"" target=""_blank"">press statement announcing the request for public comment</a> also noted that federal courts have requested administrative determinations from the FDA regarding whether food products containing ingredients produced using genetic engineering or foods containing high fructose corn syrup may be labeled as “natural.”
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17546"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/food-labeling.jpg"" alt=""As store shelves become crowded with products that feature food labeling purporting to be “natural,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is asking the public to weigh in on what the term means."" width=""523"" height=""244"" /></p>
In a 2014 letter to several federal court judges, the FDA stated that its existing policy defined “natural” label on food products as meaning “nothing artificial or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food that would not normally be expected to be in the food.” The FDA now acknowledges that its policy is in serious need of an update.

“[T]his policy was not intended to address food production methods, such as the use of pesticides, nor did it explicitly address food processing or manufacturing methods, such as thermal technologies, pasteurization, or irradiation. The FDA also did not consider whether the term “natural” should describe any nutritional or other health benefit,” the FDA stated.

The FDA has not committed to sanctioning a specific definition of “natural” to be applied in food product labeling. Rather, the agency is specifically seeking information and public comment on questions such as:
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle;margin-left:50px;"">
	<li>Whether it is appropriate to define the term “natural,”</li>
	<li>If so, how the agency should define “natural,” and</li>
	<li>How the agency should determine appropriate use of the term on food labels.</li>
</ul>
The FDA is accepting public comments through February 10, 2016. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s actions on this issue and will provide updates as they become available.

17549,"Monkey Denied Copyright In A “Selfie”","A federal judge in California recently delivered some bad news to a macaque named Naruto. Hon. William H. Orrick of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California tentatively ruled that the animal is not entitled to a copyright in a “selfie” photograph she took after absconding with the camera of British photographer David Slater.<strong> </strong>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17551"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/monkey-selfie.jpg"" alt=""Monkey Denied Copyright to Selfie"" width=""429"" height=""200"" /></p>
<strong>The Legal Background</strong><strong> </strong>

As previously detailed on the Scarinci Hollenbeck Business Law News Blog, Slater traveled to Indonesia to capture the crested black macaque. While he was shooting, one of primates <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/monkey-selfie-at-center-of-copyright-dispute/"">hijacked his camera and took over 100 selfies</a>. Not surprisingly, one of the photos she took of herself went viral after Slater posted it online.

Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, posted the “selfie” in its online database of public domain images. Upon discovering the image, Slater demanded that the company remove it. He argued that the copyright should vest in him because he owns the camera that captured the image and expended significant resources to capture the shot. Wikipedia refused to take down the photo, maintaining that the selfie is in the public domain because “non-human authors” are not granted an automatic copyright of photographs that they take.

The selfie saga took another strange legal twist when the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/23/world/monkey-selfie-peta-lawsuit/"">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed suit against Slater and his publisher</a>. The animal rights group maintained that the macaque was the rightful copyright owner. The copyright infringement suit argued:

<em>Naruto has the right to own and benefit from the copyright in the Monkey Selfies in the same manner and to the same extent as any other author. Had the Monkey Selfies been made by a human using Slater’s unattended camera, that human would be declared the photographs’ author and copyright owner. While the claim of authorship by species other than homo sapiens may be novel, “authorship” under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., is sufficiently broad so as to permit the protections of the law to extend to any original work, including those created by Naruto.</em><em> </em>

<strong>The Applicable Copyright Laws</strong><strong> </strong>

Under U.S. copyright law, ownership rights vest immediately. However, <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">works must satisfy three criteria in order to obtain copyright protectio</a>n. They must be in tangible medium, be original, and have author. In this case, the third requirement is causing the most debate.

In response to the initial dispute between Slater and Wikimedia, the U.S. Copyright Office issued guidance expressly stating that works created by non-humans are not subject to copyright protection. In its list of examples of non-copyrightable work, the Office included a ""photograph taken by a monkey""<strong> </strong>

<strong>The Court’s Decision</strong><strong> </strong>

The California federal court agreed that animals may not considered authors under federal copyright law. It also held that they do not have standing to sue under the Copyright Act. Its tentative order dismissing PETA’s lawsuit stated:

<em>In line with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Cetacean Community v. Bush, that while Congress and the President can extend the protection of law to animals as well as humans, there is no indication that they did so in the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office’s Compendium is consistent with the Court’s understanding.</em>

<em> </em>Of course, this is likely not the final chapter of the strange copyright tale. PETA is expected to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

These systems, like those used in our electrical grid, usually are not regularly updated.</h2><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""> </p><p>Their failure would cause significant social disruption. They are the soft underbelly of our modern world. For example, Stuxnet exploited a Siemens industrial controller not designed to withstand cyber attack.

At least three regional substations were disconnected from the grid. While not in the U.S., the Ukrainian methods and apparatuses for delivering electricity to the end-user are not significantly different. In all, around 700,000 homes lost power as a result of this attack.</p><p>The cyber attack happened when many Ukrainian power stations became <a href=""http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/04/blackenergy-trojan-strikes-again-attacks-ukrainian-electric-power-industry/"">infected by the malware package “BlackEnergy.”</a> The package’s original purpose was to spy on various business groups, such as media organizations, power companies, and telecoms. However, the malware used in this attack contained several important upgrades to its functionality—most notably: making the infected machine unbootable, wiping all data on the infected machine, and backdooring a secure shell (SSH) utility, which gave the attackers permanent access to the infected machines. Researchers suspect that the attackers used the SSH to gain access to the systems and shut them down. Meanwhile, the program wiped all the data on the systems, making their recovery much more lengthy and difficult. Finally, the attackers waged denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) on the target’s internet and phones systems to prevent power company personnel from learning about the outages.</p><p><strong>The group behind BlackEnergy is known as the “Sandworm Gang.” </strong></p><p>In the past, <a href=""http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/cve-2014-4114/"">this group has spied on NATO, Eastern European agencies, and European commercial and industrial group</a>s. Research suggests that the group operates from Russia, although confirmation has been slippery, and even if they did operate from Russia, it is not clear who is directing them. Whoever this group is though, they possess enough sophistication to run a three pronged attack: shutting down electric service, wiping data on the system computers, and coordinating a DDoS attack on internet and phone systems. No one of these three prongs is necessarily a difficult attack. However, the coordination of all three indicates that, without hyper-sophisticated malware, attackers can use a variety of low-sophistication attacks in tandem to produce a high-level result.</p><p>The infection most likely, although not confirmed, occurred through Microsoft Word macros. These sorts of attacks are considered “social engineering” attacks, which rely on duping an end-user into installing malware or taking an action they otherwise would not and should not take. This particular kind is simple and insidious. For example, the end-user receives an email from his boss saying to review the attached document ASAP. The email looks legitimate, and not wanting to disappoint the boss, the user opens the attachment. As the Word document opens, it runs a macro that installs the malicious software, unbeknownst to the end-user.</p><p>Despite experts’ warnings, attacks on these sorts of systems have been rare and usually done only for specific discrete reasons. However, with the now real threat that these attacks could become more widespread and more frequent, we will have to acknowledge that any device with a computer connected to a system, must be secured and monitored for cyber-attack.</p><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</a> Oddly enough, this is currently a pretty secure way to operate these missiles as the technology is so old that it is impervious to the advancements in cyber attack software.

17573,"Amendments Made To NYC Human Rights Law","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">In December, the New York City Council amended the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) to include “caregiver status” as a protected class. The amendment is scheduled to take effect in April.</h2>
Under the <a href=""http://src.bna.com/bR4"" target=""_blank"">amendment to the NYCHRL adopted by the City Council</a>, New York City employers will be prohibited from taking an adverse employment action against an employee or job applicant because of his/her status (or perceived status) as a caregiver.

The law broadly defines the terms “minor child” and “care recipient” to ensure protections for a broad range of familial dynamics. “Minor child” includes any child under the age of 18 who is: the caregiver’s biological, adopted or foster child; the caregiver’s legal ward; or a child for whom the caregiver stands in <em>loco parentis</em>.

The term “care recipient” means a person with a disability who: (i) is a covered relative or a person who resides in the caregiver’s household; and (ii) relies on the caregiver for medical care or to meet the needs of daily living. “Covered relative” includes a caregiver’s child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, sibling, grandchild or grandparent, and the child or parent of the caregiver’s spouse or domestic partner.

Employers covered by the NYCHRL should review their policies and procedures. In addition, it is also advisable to train managers and human resources staff regarding their new compliance obligations with regard to accommodating “caregivers.”

As a reminder, New York State also adopted a new law banning “familial status” discrimination. Under amendments to New York Labor Law (NYLL), employment agencies, licensing agencies, and labor organizations are prohibited from discriminating against workers based on their familial status, including parent caregivers.",,20160125,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/general-practice/amendments-made-to-nyc-human-rights-law/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Human-Rights.jpg,"Human Rights",,"In December, the New York City Council amended the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) to include “caregiver status” as a protected class.

<td>
<h3><strong>Failing to execute a written agreement among founders:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>When starting a new venture, it is imperative to plan for both the best and the worst. A founding shareholders or partnership agreement is the best way to avoid disagreements down the road. Some of the key issues to decide and reduce to writing include: the percentage of ownership assigned to each founder, the roles, titles and responsibilities of all founders, any special plans for funding or uses of proceeds or apportioning of profits, the procedures for making day-to-day business decisions, and the methods required to resolve disagreements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Selecting the wrong business entity:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>There are a number of legal structures available to entrepreneurs, all of which have distinct advantages and disadvantages. While a partnership may involve less paperwork, it does not shield the owners from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the business. While it may be more costly and complex, a limited liability corporation (LLC) or corporation is generally a safer choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Leaving your Intellectual property unprotected:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>When it comes to <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">protecting valuable intellectual property</a>, being proactive pays off. Even at its earliest stages, nearly every start-up has intangible assets worthy of protection, such as the company name, logo, and key products. If you fail to obtain the proper trademarks, patents, and copyrights, you may have no legal recourse should a competitor try to use them. In addition, without the proper non-disclosure agreements in place, your business partners or employees could walk out the door with your million-dollar idea. For particularly valuable intellectual property, it may be advisable to establish a separate entity for the ownership of the “crown jewels” for protecting them against future claims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Mismanaging employees:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>Hiring employees can be an exciting step for a new company. However, it is imperative that you understand your legal obligations as an employer. From tax filings to hiring agreements, there is a lot of paperwork involved. Also, while hiring independent contractors may seem like a great way to avoid many state and federal employment laws, misclassification can lead to significant penalties. So, it’s important to understand the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Thinking you can do it on your own:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>In order to cut costs, many entrepreneurs try to take everything on themselves. This is a <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/jessica-bruder/psychological-price-of-entrepreneurship.html"" target=""_blank"">bad idea for many reasons. First, you likely already have too much on your plate.</a> Second, when it comes to accounting and legal issues, mistakes can be disastrous, costing your start-up both time and money in the long run. The best course of action is to hire.</td>

17621,"Should You Set Up a Personal Financial Dashboard?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">If one of your goals for 2016 is to manage your money more effectively, you may want to consider setting up a financial dashboard.</h2>
For busy business professionals, it can be easy to lose sight of the big picture without a financial dashboard amidst the flurry of paperwork, i.e. bank statements, tax records, investment and retirement account statements, loan documents, and other financial records. Even with the proliferation of e-statements, tracking and organizing emails isn’t much easier.
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17626"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/financial-dashboard.jpg"" alt=""If one of your goals for 2016 is to manage your money more effectively, you may want to consider setting up a financial dashboard."" width=""420"" height=""196"" /></p>
In essence, a financial dashboard tracks several key metrics, such as savings, debt and goals, in order to provide an overall look at your financial health. The greatest benefit is that the tool readily shows where you are financially, including how things are going over time.  That is important in planning for spending, saving, investing and retirement.

You can create a basic financial dashboard using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The process involves creating different columns for each major aspect of your financial life and entering the relevant information. For many people, the process of creating the dashboard can be just as enlightening as the finished product. Below are several key “buckets” to address:
<table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Professional and/or life-stage milestones:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>Life changes can be disruptive to the best laid financial plans. Getting married, having a child, starting a business, and retiring are the most significant milestones, but family health changes and changing jobs, can have a financial impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Savings:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>Long-term cash/liquid savings should have its own column. Unlike investments, these funds can be accessed quickly and should not fluctuate with market conditions. Since the dashboard is for future planning purposes, most financial advisers recommend leaving out short-term savings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Investments: </strong></h3>
</td>
<td>For many, this part of the dashboard will be the most labor intensive. Investments should ideally be sub-divided into how much you are contributing and how much the portfolio is growing. You can also f<a href=""http://www.finra.org/investors"">urther divide the category by type of investment</a>, i.e. 401(k), mutual funds, brokerage accounts, alternative investments, in order to see how each is performing and make adjustments as needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3><strong>Debt:</strong></h3>
</td>
<td>For those approaching retirement or otherwise seeking to pay down debt, it is imperative to track mortgage payments, student loan debt, credit card bills, business loans. List current balances as well as expected pay off dates. Knowing when certain debts will be eliminated can help determine how the funds can be allocated in the future.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
If a DIY dashboard sounds daunting, templates are available online. In addition, there is always “an app for that.” There are several applications, such as Mint, <a href=""https://www.mint.com/"">that promise to keep track of financial statements</a> without having to visit each website to track down the information. In addition to being constantly updated, online financial dashboards also offer a number of useful extras, such as fancy charts and graphs, that show how your money comes in and goes out.

17646,"Government To Collect Pay Data To Combat Wage Discrimination","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently announced a proposal to collect pay data from employers. The agency plans to use the information it collects to combat wage discrimination.</h2>
As a way to combat wage discrimination, the EEOC is specifically <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/"">proposing to revise the Employer Information Report (EEO-1) </a>to include collecting pay data from employers, including federal contractors, with more than 100 employees. President Barak Obama announced the proposal on January 29, 2016 in conjunction with the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly"">White House commemoration of the seventh anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.</a>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17649"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Combat-Wage-Discrimination.jpg"" alt=""The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently announced a proposal to collect pay data from employers. The agency plans to use the information it collects to combat wage discrimination."" width=""439"" height=""205"" /></p>
Currently, the federal government uses EEO-1 reports to collect race, ethnicity, sex, and job category data from private employers. This proposal would add aggregate data on pay ranges and hours worked to the information collected. According to the EEOC, the new pay data would provide the agency with insight into pay disparities across industries and occupations. It could then use the information to evaluate employment discrimination complaints, identify investigation targets, and detect pay disparities trends that may warrant additional study.

“More than 50 years after pay discrimination became illegal it remains a persistent problem for too many Americans,” EEOC Chairwoman Jenny R. Yang said in a press statement. “This information will assist employers in evaluating their pay practices to prevent pay discrimination and strengthen enforcement of our federal anti-discrimination laws.”

In response to potential pushback from employers, the EEOC proposal highlights the revised report will collect salary data from employees' W-2 earnings and hours worked, which EEO-1 filers already maintain in the ordinary course of business. Of course, compiling and submitting the data will still involve some administrative burden.

The EEOC’s proposed changes have been published on the Federal Register website, and the public will have 60 days from that date April 1, 2016, to submit comments. Once finalized, the proposed changes would take effect with the September 2017 report.

Once the EEOC has the pay data in hand, enforcement actions are sure to follow. In the meantime, New York and New Jersey employers are advised to review their records to evaluate whether pay disparities arise out of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. Failure to engage in such analysis could lead to lawsuits and costly liability.

Employer should also consider submitting comments to the EEOC to express their legitimate concerns. Raw data that appears to reveal possible disparities does not, without more, provide necessary inputs for a nuanced and fair review of those numbers. In the absence of additional questions and a fair attempt to look behind the data, employers may face unfair and expensive governmental onslaughts. Based upon the EEOC’s recent enforcement actions that have, at times, been criticized by the courts, concerns over any rush to judgment by the EEOC and the unfairness of facile reviews and conclusions should be vigorously expressed.

Estate tax returns filed after July 2015 and now required to file Form 8971 <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8971/ch01.html"">with the IRS Service Center</a> in Cincinnati by February 29, 2016.  Schedule A to Form 8971 reports the e<a href=""https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f8971--dft.pdf"">state tax value of property passing from an estate or decedent to that beneficiary</a>.  Each beneficiary will receive a separate Schedule A reporting the property received by him or her.  Form 8971 and Schedule A is a reporting requirement that is separate and distinct from the obligation to file an estate tax return.  Form 8971 is not filed as part of the estate tax return.
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17655"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Form-8971.jpg"" alt=""Form 8971 Must Be Filed By February 29, 2016 For Certain Estates"" width=""424"" height=""198"" /></p>
Notice 2015-57 fixed February 29, 2016 as the due date for all Forms 8971 and all Schedules A, that are  required to be filed with IRS after July 31, 2015 and before February 29, 2016.  Returns filed after that date will require Form 8971 to be filed no later than the earlier 30 days after the date Form 706, Form 706-NA or Form 706-A is filed (including extensions) or, if the first Form 706, Form 706-NA or Form 706-A is filed after the due date and after July 2015, 30 days after filing.

<a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"">Penalties for failure to timely file Form 8971 with Schedule(s) A are $50 per day with a maximum penalty </a>of $532,000 per year ($186,000 if taxpayer qualifies for lower penalties).  The penalty is $260 per day if filed after 30 days after the due date up to $3,193,000 per year ($1,064,000 if taxpayer qualifies for lower penalties).

In most estates, the distribution has not occurred at the time of filing of the estate tax return so the executor must list all items that could be used, in whole or in part, the fund a beneficiary’s distribution. Many Schedule A will contain duplicate information.

The executor is required to maintain proof of delivery of each beneficiary’s Schedule A in his or her file.  Proof of delivery is not to be confused with proof of mailing. Where the value is adjusted in an audit or in Tax Court, a supplemental Form 8971 and Schedule A, reporting only the changed information, must be filed within 30 days of the adjustment.  The standard due going forward is Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A are due 30 days after the estate tax return.

We know that a beneficiary may sell or depreciate inherited property and the basis of that property is essential for the beneficiary’s income tax treatment.  We suspect IRS is also closing the door on taxpayers who have taken liberties with the basis of inherited property in order to avoid income tax.  What is certain is that penalties will be assessed because estates that must file Form 706 receive little sympathy and the preparers will receive even less.

By comparison, established economies, such as the United States, saw only a slight rise in registrations."" width=""426"" height=""199"" /></p>
According to a <a href=""http://trademarks.thomsonreuters.com/industry-resources/industry-research/special-reports?id=node%2F10669"">new report by Thomson CompuMark</a>, China registered 1.7 million new trademarks in 2014, which represents a 71 percent increase over 2013 figures. Overall, China published more trademarks in 2014 than all the other top 10 trademark registrars combined. The top ten list for 2014 trademark volume included the United States, France, Turkey, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Canada and the Russian Federation.<strong> </strong>

As the report notes, trademark filings and economic activity often go hand in hand. “Trademark filings continue to be a strong indicator of global economic trends,” said Mark Frost, general manager of Thomson CompuMark, in a statement. “Trademark activity surfaces important trends, such as where businesses are placing emphasis in their international growth strategies, what industries are building out brand portfolios, and the overall health of the global economy.”

Other studies have reached similar conclusions regarding trademarks <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">and other intellectual property filings</a> in China. In its annual report, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) also found that China was driving the growth in IP filings. According to WIPO’s <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/wipi/"">2015 edition of the World Intellectual Property Indicators</a>, China had highest trademark filing activity the world for 2014, experiencing growth of 18.2 percent. By comparison, the United States saw filings increase 6.7 percent.

<strong>Trademark Challenges in China</strong>

For companies that are <a href=""http://www.saic.gov.cn/sbjEnglish/flfg1_1/"">considering Chinese trademark registration</a>, it is important to understand that China’s intellectual property laws are very different from those in the United States. Under the country’s “first to file” system, trademark rights are generally bestowed on the first entity to file an application. By comparison, U.S. trademark registrants must show that they have used, or planned to use, the mark in commerce.

Under the Chinese first-to-file system, there is incentive for brand counterfeiters and hijackers to pursue trademark rights ahead of U.S. companies. Many international corporations, including Tesla, Pfizer and Apple, have expanded into China only to discover that so-called trademark “squatters” had already secured trademark registrations for their brands. As a result, they have been forced to enter protracted legal battles or pay significant sums to buy back their trademarks.

In 2014, China enacted trademark reforms intended to curb such predatory practices. Key changes included increasing the potential penalties for trademark infringement to six times the previous limit; making it easier for owners of “renowned” trademarks to prohibit others from registering their trademarks or using similar one; and expressly imposing principles of good faith in trademark registration and use.

The Chinese trademark reforms are a good start. However, the bottom-line is that if you plan to enter the Chinese market, it is advisable to act quickly to protect your brand. To start, an informal search of China's online trademark database can alert you to any potential squatters. The next step is to consult with an experienced IP lawyer that also has experience in the Chinese market.",,20160209,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/business-at-risk-from-international-trademark-squatters/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/international-trademark-squatters.jpg,international-trademark-squatters,,,"China saw a rapid rise in trademark filings in 2015, suggesting that multinational brands are continuing to expand their operations there.

Investors have poured more than two trillion dollars into ETFs since they were first introduced in the United States in 1993. As ETFs gain increasing popularity among everyday investors, regulators are boosting their oversight. Most notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently announced that it plans to examine the operations of ETFs in the coming year. The current market volatility, for now on the downside, is enhanced by leverage and in-and-out strategies used by an Exchange Trade Fund.
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-17670"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Exchange-Trade-Fund.jpg"" alt=""Investment 101: What Is an Exchange Trade Fund?"" width=""424"" height=""198"" /></p>
<strong>What Is an Exchange Trade Fund?</strong>

Despite their rapidly growing popularity, many investors are unfamiliar with how ETFs work. To start, an Exchange Trade Fund is an ""exchange-traded fund."" The <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/investment-banking/"">investment funds must register with the SEC under the 1940 Act</a> as either an open-end investment company or a unit investment trust.

As described by the SEC, <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf"">ETFs are similar to mutual funds</a> in that they allow investors to pool into an investment vehicle that purchases stocks, bonds, or other assets. In return, investors receive an interest in the pool of underlying assets. However, unlike a mutual fund, an Exchange Trade Fund trades on a public stock exchange. In addition, the net asset value (NAV) of an Exchange Trade Fund is not calculated at the end of each day.

ETFs are popular because they are generally more transparent, liquid and cost-effective than similar investments, such as mutual funds. As noted above, they can be bought and sold like stocks with transaction costs that are much lower than mutual funds. In addition, because capital gains from sales within the Exchange Trade Fund are not passed on to shareholders, they have certain tax advantages.

Before jumping into the Exchange Trade Fund market, investors should also understand that there are a number of different types of ETFs, which can vary in both complexity and volatility. The most basic ETFs, known as Spiders, invests in all of the stocks included in the S&amp;P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. On the other end of the spectrum, the goal of a leveraged or inverse ETFs is to achieve a daily return that is a multiple or an inverse multiple of the daily return of a securities index.

<strong>Increased Regulatory Oversight</strong><strong> </strong>

In December, the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-276.html"">SEC proposed a new rule designed to further regulate the use of derivatives by ETFs</a> and other investment vehicles. The proposed rule would limit funds’ use of derivatives and mandate the use of certain risk management measures intended to protect investors.

“The current regulatory framework no longer effectively achieves the statutory objectives of the Investment Company Act, which seeks to protect investors from the risks of excessive leverage,” SEC Chair Mary Jo White stated.

Notably, the SEC’s rule proposal limits aggregate exposure to derivatives an Exchange Trade Fund can have to 150 percent of a fund’s net assets. A fund would be permitted to obtain exposure up to 300 percent of the fund’s net assets, provided that the fund satisfies a risk-based test is designed to determine whether the fund’s derivatives transactions, in aggregate, result in a fund portfolio that is subject to less market risk than if the fund did not use derivatives. Critics of the rule argue that it would effectively force some leveraged ETFs out of business.

17743,"Federal Government Looks To Strengthen Data Security","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">President Obama Proposes to Strengthen Data Security For The Federal Government – What would that really mean?</h2><p>After a series of high-profile breaches of federal government systems, President Barak Obama’s recently proposed federal budget for fiscal 2017 includes $19 billion allocation for a broad cybersecurity initiative to strengthen data security. The budget proposal for cybersecurity-related activities represents a more than 35 percent increase from last year’s funding request.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-17760"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthen-Data-Security.jpg"" alt=""President Obama Proposes to Strengthen Data Security For The Federal Government – What would that really mean?"" width=""366"" height=""171"" /></p><h3>High-Profile Federal Data Breaches</h3><p>Federal government databases hold a treasure trove of information for hackers, whether they seek to conduct cyberwarfare or simply commit identity fraud. Earlier this month, the names, titles, phone numbers and email addresses of approximately 30,000 employees of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Protection were posted online. According to the hackers, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/politics/hackers-fbi-employee-info/index.html"">they obtained the data by breaking into a Department of Justice database</a>. Other high-profile cyberattacks on the federal government include a data intrusion at the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the information of 20 million current and federal employees and contractors.</p><h3>Proposed Cybersecurity Initiative</h3><p>As a means to deter future data breaches, the Obama Administration is seeking to modernize the federal government’s aging technical infrastructure. In addition to devoting $3.1 billion to the IT overhaul, the President’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan also calls for a new Federal Chief Information Security Officer who will coordinate the retirement and replacement of legacy IT across the government. Federal agencies will also be required to “identify and prioritize their highest value and most at-risk IT assets” and then implement additional security measures.</p><p>""This is not ideological issue. It doesn't matter if there's a Democratic president or a Republican president. If you've got broken, old systems — computers, mainframes, software — that doesn't work anymore, then you can keep on putting a bunch of patch on it but it's not going to make it safe,"" President Obama said.</p><p>Pursuant to the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan"">President’s Executive Order on cybersecurity</a>, the federal government also plans to speed up the adoption of multi-factor authentication and identity proofing for digital services offered to the public. It will also launch public service campaigns regarding the importance of using multi-factor authentication when logging into other online accounts, such as social media and email accounts.</p><p>The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP) also includes <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">cybersecurity proposals related to businesses and the private sector</a>. Most notably, the President plans to establish the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, which would be comprised of “top strategic, business, and technical thinkers from outside of Government.” The Commission would be tasked with recommending “actions that can be taken over the next decade to enhance cybersecurity awareness and protections throughout the private sector and at all levels of Government, to protect privacy, to maintain public safety and economic and national security, and to empower Americans to take better control of their digital security.”</p><p>Of course, many of the proposed cybersecurity measures will require Congress to sign off. While President Obama has had difficulty pushing many budget proposals through the House of Representatives, the White House stated that President Obama has already had positive discussions with the newly elected Speaker of the House, Rep. Paul Ryan.</p><p>Time will tell if this budget will confront opposition, but time is certainly of the essence when it comes to confronting cyber security.</p>",,20160216,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/litigation/cyber-security/federal-government-looks-to-strengthen-data-security/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthen-Data-Security.jpg,"Apple Terrorist Investigation with the DOJ",,,"Apple Terrorist Investigation Case - Does Data Security Matter",,"Firm Insights>Litigation>Cyber Security","Cyber Lawyer|Cyber Security|Fernando M.

According to JLL's report, New Jersey's landlord-favorable office space has many commercial real estate industry experts projecting an extremely bright future for the state.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-17770"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-Jersey-Commercial-Office-Space.jpg"" alt=""New Jersey Commercial Office Space is hot right now!New Jersey Commercial Office Space is hot right now!"" width=""411"" height=""192"" /></p><p><strong>New Jersey's strong job market attracting companies to office spaces</strong><br /> The report found that with the exception of June and July, the state added job gains each month in 2015 for a total of more than 55,000 for the year. This represented a 15-year high in new job creation. With these rapidly increasing job gains, the outlook for the office market is bright for this year.</p><p><strong>New Jersey is the more attractive option to Manhattan</strong><br /> The most significant reason for this shift toward office space, particularly in the northern and central New Jersey areas, is proximity to Midtown Manhattan. According to Real Estate Weekly, Michael Stoler, president of New York Real Estate TV and moderator of the NYC Real Estate Expo panel, noted that office locations in New Jersey have become popular due to <a href=""http://rew-online.com/2015/11/18/new-york-city-helping-out-its-neighbors/"">proximity, safety and transportation</a>.<br /> <br /> ""(The industry) thinks of Hoboken, not Newark, it's not the topic of interest. But we've lost some tenants to New Jersey,"" Stoler explained. ""Why?""<br /> <br /> The answer to the question Stoler posed is simple: cheaper land prices and the same basic amenities are contributing to a positive future for companies moving to New Jersey office spaces. In fact, these northern and central New Jersey locations such as Jersey City, Red Bank, Monmouth County and Bergen County are positioned to have strong futures in the long- term because they are located within 30 minutes of Manhattan. This enables them to offer the same attractive factors of New York City, with the added bonus of more industrial and office spaces, affordable housing and commercial entities.<br /> <br /> <strong>New Jersey gains support of commercial real estate experts</strong><br /> At the NAIOP Annual Meeting and Commercial Real Estate Outlook in New Jersey, more than 300 commercial real estate leaders cited New Jersey as a location with limitless potential. According to an NJ.com report, Benjamin Breslau, international director of Americas research with Jones Lang LaSalle, stated at the conference that the state <a href=""http://blog.nj.com/new_jersey_businesses_whats_happening/2016/02/reinventing_the_suburbs_re-energizing_mature_facilities_are_keys_to_growth_in_2016.html"">fits all the criteria</a> of the national push toward urbanization.</p><p>""Transit-oriented, dense, urban environments are doing well, and suburban markets are slow,"" Breslau argued. ""One of the greatest opportunities for developers and investors over the next decade may very well be reinventing the suburbs.""</p><p>With the demand for mixed-use office locations on the rise, New Jersey's abundant land will continue to attract big business. One prime example cited at the conference by Mitchell Rudin, CEO of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, was his company's Harborside complex on the Jersey City Waterfront.</p><p>""There are 135,000 workers and residents within walking distance of the property who are prospective patrons of retail and dining establishments,"" Rudin said.<br /> <br /> Ed Russo, CEO of Russo Development, agreed that projects like Mack-Cali's Harborside complex have the potential to be game-changers in the area due to the close proximity of New Jersey's suburbs to Manhattan.<br /> <br /> ""The demographics in the Northeast Corridor are particularly ripe for development,"" said Russo, whose firm is currently focused on multifamily and data center projects. ""In addition, this year's Supreme Court ruling relieving the Council on Affordable Housing of responsibility for affordable housing rules and putting it in the hands of municipalities is opening an enormous opportunity we haven't seen in years.""<br /> <br /> Russo also added that there are numerous projects his company is planning in the northern and central New Jersey areas due to a lack of inventory in New York City locations.<br /> <br /> ""With the shortage of available space and increased competition, we are finally starting to see some meaningful appreciation in rents, which is long overdue,"" Russo commented. ""We expect this trend to continue in 2016.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,20160223,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/new-jersey-is-becoming-a-popular-hub-for-office-space/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-Jersey-Commercial-Office-Space.jpg,New-Jersey-Commercial-Office-Space,,"New Jersey Commercial Office Space is hot right now!","New Jersey Commercial Office Space is hot right now!New Jersey Commercial Office Space is hot right now!",,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate","New Jersey|new jersey business|New Jersey Lawyer|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,46,new-jersey-is-becoming-a-popular-hub-for-office-space,,,0,0,closed,open

With its close proximity to Manhattan, the area has become a haven for underutilized office buildings that can be remodeled and renovated at discounted prices.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-17777"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bergen-County-Commercial-Real-Estate.jpg"" alt=""Bergen County Commercial Real Estate Is hot right now and only getting hotter! "" width=""405"" height=""189"" /></p><p><strong>Potential boom in premier office property due to vacancy rates</strong></p><p>This investment trend has already begun, but the expectation is that northern Bergen County will continue to fill up its high quality commercial office buildings. According to an interview with NorthJersey.com, Andrew J. Merin, vice chairman and head of the investment sales group at Cushman &amp; Wakefield in the East Rutherford area, explained that these office buildings have great potential for investment because of their <a href=""http://www.northjersey.com/news/business/north-jersey-s-office-market-seen-attracting-investors-1.1484301"">high quality and location</a>.</p><p>""When someone buys an older building, they do several things to increase value,"" Merin stated. ""They will renovate the main lobby and look at the amenities package - a cafeteria, exercise room, shared conference rooms."" Merin's comments are somewhat counterintuitive given the recent trend in northern Bergen County as major corporations have left the area, which resulted in the high vacancy rates. However, as Jeff Hipschman, senior managing director for New Jersey at the real estate firm CBRE, argued in a separate interview with NorthJersey.com, the same basic tenets of real estate still apply: location, location, location. ""Owners are picking their assets to invest in,"" Hipschman commented. ""They see opportunities for rent growth in 2016 for top assets.""</p><p><strong>Bergen County's advantages</strong><br /> With vacancy rates in Midtown Manhattan increasing for premier commercial office space, investors see more opportunities in northern New Jersey's location, population density and proximity to highway systems. This makes office buildings in Bergen County more attractive for all types of manufacturing and warehousing companies because of its access to all points in the tri-state region. A prime example of this type of repurposing recently was Montvale's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which took over a commercial office space. In the same interview with NorthJersey.com, Merin explained that many potential investors are eyeing office locations in the area to repurpose them into medical and industrial spaces. ""When I started out in the 1970s, the Meadowlands was emerging and people were buying old industrial buildings and tearing them down and putting up office buildings,"" Merin noted. ""Now people are looking at buying office buildings, tearing them down and putting up industrial.""</p><p>Vacancy rates for industrial buildings in Bergen County hit 6.4 percent in 2015, which marked the lowest level in eight years. Merin expects this trend in occupancy rates for industrial properties to increase this year as more office buildings become repurposed.</p>",,20160219,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/bergen-county-beginning-to-attract-investors-to-commercial-office-space/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bergen-County-Commercial-Real-Estate.jpg,Bergen-County-Commercial-Real-Estate,,"Bergen County Commercial Real Estate Is hot right now and  potentially getting hotter!

The first, of course, is Apple vs. FBI. A push in Congress is now under way to end the seeming logjam of priorities. Permitting exceptions to a cyber-security defense inherently weakens it. On the other hand, digital data is just papers and personal effects—searchable with a warrant. Both the Senate and the House are preparing rare bipartisan bills to address the dilemma. The Senate bill, which would effectively codify the court ruling, is not broadly supported. More promising at the moment is the bill in the House. Its stated purpose is to bring both sides to the table to discuss if they can agree on common rules.

A string of data breaches have been rattling federal agencies and the time has come to address the concern. Particularly, the Office of Personnel Management disgorged the data of 22 million people last summer. A fresh round of hearings, modestly called “OPM data breach: Part III,” resulted in the resignation of OPM’s CIO and a general scramble at the top. The House Oversight Chair, Jason Chaffetz, announced, ""On her watch, whether through negligence or incompetence, millions of Americans lost their privacy and personal data."" As OPM’s public beating continues, one wonders what the Apple brass think when they see what happens to those whose cyber-security is breached.

Although the phone in question does not have the same encryption standards as the one in California, the Court still found that Apple’s assistance was needed. Considering Apple’s refusal to comply with the All Writs Act, the Court requested that Apple provide it with additional details regarding other All Writs requests it had received while Apple’s case was before the Eastern District, and how Apple had handled them.</p><p>The Court specifically asked whether Apple “opposed the request or otherwise sought or obtained an opportunity to be heard on it before it was resolved.” Apple responded, offering a list of orders to which it had objected. However, Apple’s strategy of moving this argument from the courts to the public at large becomes apparent in these correspondences. The U.S. Attorney points out in a response letter, that Apple’s “objections” to these orders have been in the form of ignoring them. That is, Apple never sought legal relief from these orders, but simply did not comply—something unquestionably unlawful.</p><p>Now that the San Bernardino case has brought Apple’s legitimate concerns to the fore, Apple seems to be painting a picture that it has always vigorously defended itself against the All Writs Act. It seems more likely that the company has been waiting for the publicity to attach to these cases before Apple truly made its case. Or, simply waiting to be significantly challenged.  Whether that is ultimately a good or bad strategy remains to be seen, but it is certainly a peculiar kind of defense as courts tend to disfavor those who disobey their orders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</span>  February, 26, 2016 - <strong>Microsoft Joins the Fray in Support of Apple</strong></h2><p>Microsoft, one of the more “government-friendly” technology companies, announced that it would be filing a legal brief next week in support of Apple. Pointing out that the specific language used for the Judicial Order from the All Writs Act came from 1911, a time when the adding machine was the most advanced computing device, Microsoft’s president joined the clarion call for definitive legislation.</p><p>Although no longer with the company, this comes in contrast to a recent statement by Bill Gates. While not a full-throated supporter of the government’s position, he made comments recently that Apple had been, in effect, exaggerating the proportions of the order. Particularly, he noted that the FBI was not asking for a backdoor, but that it was merely asking for access to one iPhone and that Apple is obligated to comply.</p><p>Notable about Microsoft’s position now is that it does not address the immediate issue of the San Bernardino iPhone. This most likely points to Microsoft’s highly calibrated Public Relations stance in the ongoing Public Opinion debate. Were it to agree with Mr. Gate’s point of view in any sense, Microsoft would most likely lose legitimacy in the market and have to fight accusations that it is the government’s technology lackey. However, were it to embrace the Apple point of view, as many other technology companies (<em>e.g.</em>, Google and Facebook) have, then Microsoft could damage its presumably good relations with government officials while risking getting dragged into the specifics of the case.</p><p>Lastly, such posturing could work out quite well for Microsoft. If an All Writs Act equivalent is passed with even mild support, it would give Microsoft a shield to defend itself against complicity with the government and the goodwill associated with developing an agreement, however strong it turns out to be, between Apple and the government. We will have more information on this aspect when Microsoft files its legal brief. For more insight into this new development, visit: <a href=""http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/270747-microsoft-plans-to-back-apple-in-court"" target=""_blank"">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/270747-microsoft-plans-to-back-apple-in-court</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</span>  March, 4, 2016 - <strong>Federal Judge in NY Rules For Apple</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Finally, given the government’s boundless interpretation of the All Writs Act, it is hard to conceive of any limits on the orders the government could obtain in the future.”</p></blockquote><p>Following-up on our February 25<sup>th</sup> post, the federal Magistrate Judge in the Eastern District of New York ruled yesterday that the All Writs Act was an inappropriate legal tool for the government to compel Apple’s assistance in accessing one of its products.</p><p>The case here is different from the San Bernardino case in a number of respects, including that the defendant already had pled guilty to drug related charges, and the iPhone was never encrypted. However, after the guilty plea, the government still claimed that access to the phone was essential to the investigation<strong>, </strong>and that Apple’s assistance would be required. Because the defendant had already plead guilty, the case seemed to take on a more academic tone as the two sides grappled with the scope of the All Writs Act.</p><p>The case took on a heighted scrutiny after Apple splashed the world news, opposing the San Bernardino order. Not wasting the opportunity as the first ruling on the All Writs Act since then, Judge James Orenstein ruled that the Government’s interpretation went too far.</p><p>The judge used this opportunity to set out the legal nuances of the pro-privacy argument. He addressed one of the government lynchpins, that Apple licenses (and does not sell) its software, saying, “In a world in which so many devices, not just smartphones, will be connected to the Internet of Things, the government's theory that a licensing agreement allows it to compel the manufacturers of such products to help it surveil the products' users will result in a virtually limitless expansion of the government's legal authority to surreptitiously intrude on personal privacy.”</p><p>The judge’s argument is a reflection of Apple own arguments in the San Bernardino case—particularly, when he stated: “Finally, given the government’s boundless interpretation of the All Writs Act, it is hard to conceive of any limits on the orders the government could obtain in the future.”</p><p>So, while this case is noteworthy and useful for laying out the legal principals of the pro-privacy argument, it does not work much in resolving the bigger questions in the privacy vs. security debate. The ruling, effectively, merely picked a winning side in the unique circumstances before the court. Thus, while meaningful and persuasive, the ruling does not resolve the debate. </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</span> March 11, 2016 -  <strong>Fault Line Appears in Government Stance</strong></h2><p>Federal prosecutors filed an unsurprising reply to support their position on Thursday. Coming off the heels of the minor Apple victory in the Eastern District of New York (discussed above), the reply sought to firmly state the government’s unwavering commitment to make Apple unlock a terrorist’s iPhone. The brief, notably more hostile than other court filings, did its best to castigate Apple for making a marketing mission out of an important federal case.</p><p>Although the most salacious allegation is that Apple is complicit with China, the most persuasive one is that Apple is perfectly capable of keeping the cat in the bag. The DOJ correctly points out that Apple protects its source code and its electronic signatures so that no one can access them. To date, Apple has successfully protected the crown jewels.</p><p> The forcefulness of the reply is somewhat undercut by a now open fissure in the government’s position. Reportedly, on Tuesday a Federal Trade Commissioner, Julie Brill, expressed deep concern that those in law enforcement think that technology can either be hacked in a good way or a bad way and that such thinking was “magical.” She added, “Just to be clear, I’m not against law enforcement. I am law enforcement.”</p><p>Another Commissioner, Terrell McSweeny, went on to support Ms. Brill in her frank assessment of the situation. McSweeny said, “If we’re ever going to have effective telemedicine, connected cars or secure financial payment systems, we cannot legislate vulnerabilities into our devices.”</p><p>While Apple probably possesses the capability to break into one iPhone one time, is it reasonable to expect that all similarly situated technology companies should do the same, especially when the government is likely to keep coming back with more phones to decrypt?</p><p><em>Sources: Ars Technica and Law 360</em></p><p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ADDITIONAL ARTICLES:</span><br /> </strong>""<strong>Is Forcing Apple to Bypass Its Own Security Technology “Unreasonably Burdensome”?"" </strong><a href=""http://www.bna.com/forcing-apple-bypass-n57982067672/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bna.com/forcing-apple-bypass-n57982067672/</a> - Bloomberg BNA, February 24, 2016</p><p class=""article-headline article-page-headline inc_editable_area"" data-area-class=""Archetype""><strong>""The FBI vs Apple: What Does the Law Actually Say?"" </strong><a href=""http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/the-fbi-vs-apple-what-does-the-law-actually-say.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/the-fbi-vs-apple-what-does-the-law-actually-say.html</a> - INC.com - February 26, 2016</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>VIDEOS:</strong></span></p><p style=""height: 300px; width: 531px; float: left;""><script src=""http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=71fea79861d14fce867bc2d59a66edd8&amp;ec=9jd3kxMTE6ScBoyxF9-pmU9RNsYVED06""></script><strong>Will California’s ruling impact Apple’s legendary brand if they work with feds?</strong></p><p style=""height: 300px; width: 531px; float: right;""><script src=""http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=71fea79861d14fce867bc2d59a66edd8&amp;ec=ZsY3QxMTE6u4whUm8tUuWTJuCjTNfMaG""></script><strong>Feds v.

17817,"Filmmakers Need To Consider Shoot location tax incentives","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Shoot location tax incentives are an important for film makers to consider when trying to create a film.</h2><p>Depending on the state a production team chooses to film in, there may be shoot location tax incentives involved.</p><p>Tax breaks are important to actors, directors, producers, studios and everyone else involved in the development of a film. These incentives often have a part in determining the location of a set. Matthew McConaughey, for example, <a href=""http://gardenandgun.com/article/gg-interview-matthew-mcconaughey"">named film credits as a reason he can be found in New Orleans so often</a>. McConaughey, a Texas native, most recently returned to the Pelican State to film his upcoming movie ""Free State of Jones."" He also starred in the first season of the critically acclaimed ""True Detective,"" which was set in Louisiana.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-17825"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Shoot-location-tax-incentives.png"" alt=""Shoot location tax incentives are an important for film makers to consider when trying to create a film."" width=""454"" height=""212"" /></p><p>""There's a great tax break to make films here,"" he told Joe Bargmann, who asked him why he repeatedly returns to New Orleans in an interview for a Garden &amp; Gun article.</p><p>Actor Matthew McConaughey said in an interview that he loves New Orleans because of the tax breaks.</p><p><strong>State-by-state tax breaks can draw film makers, or push them away</strong><br /> Tax breaks such as those McConaughey takes advantage of in Louisiana often factor into decisions about where to film. They differ by state, and depending on location can offer huge savings. Essentially these incentives come in the form of a refund or rebate offered to the production team. The money is a portion of the total qualified amount spent in the state. When filming is finished in a given location, the production team will provide an account of spending to the state. That account will then be reviewed, and the proper return eventually will make its way back to the film team.</p><p>State regulations regarding tax incentives factor heavily into a studio and production team's decision were to film. For example, Las Vegas Weekly noted that despite the city's recent successes as a result of incentives in 2014 and 2015, more recent and less <a href=""http://lasvegasweekly.com/as-we-see-it/2016/jan/27/will-meager-tax-credits-stunt-moviemaking-in-las-v/"">appealing credit packages could drive filmmakers to competing states, such as New Mexico.</a></p><p>Will <a href=""https://t.co/6hzDFqBywk pic.twitter.com/u24U18qyXN"">meager tax credits stunt moviemakin</a>g in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/LasVegas?src=hash"">#LasVegas</a>? </p><p>— Las Vegas Weekly (<a href=""https://twitter.com/lasvegasweekly/status/693148612973309952"">@lasvegasweekly</a>) January 29, 2016</p><p>JR Reid, the founder of JR Lighting, told the publication that Las Vegas could lose business as a result of the decision to remove certain incentives. He explained that his hope that production teams are offered attractive tax packages again shortly.</p><p>""We're not the only people looking at this"" he explained. ""It's national, even international. Investors and big companies and financiers - and back to the people on the ground - look at these decisions and wonder if they should plant a flag here. Once we renege on [tax incentives] they don't think we're serious.""</p><p><strong>Choosing a location is just a part of budgeting </strong><br /> Nevada and New Mexico are just two states out of 50, though. While, according to Reid, ""meager incentives"" may drive film makers away from Las Vegas, other states and cities feature attractive tax packages that regularly appeal to studios and producers. Movie studios are the beneficiaries of a huge collection of tax breaks. The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/us/when-hollywood-comes-to-town.html"">industry as a whole collects around $1.5 billion in state and local tax credits annually</a>, according to The New York Times. To get a relatively large chunk of that total, though, takes research into where production companies and studios stand to gain the most.</p><p>Like in real estate, in film production the motto is ""location, location, location.""

Myriad states offer some sort of film credits, though some packages are significantly better than others. Here are a few of the states to consider when choosing a set location:</p><h3>1.California</h3><p>Let's get the obvious options out of the way first before we move on to that twist ending. One of the most obvious is the home of Hollywood and some of its biggest stars. Here are a few of the benefits filmmakers who shoot in California enjoy:</p><table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;""><tbody><tr><td>A 20 percent tax credit for feature films budgeted at at least $1 million, movies of the week or miniseries with a budget of at least $500,000 and new basic cable television series with a minimum budget of $1 million.</td></tr><tr><td>A 25 percent credit for both basic cable television series that previously filmed outside of the state and independent films with minimum budgets of $1 million. The latter must not be owned by a publicly traded company.</td></tr><tr><td>5 percent additional credits for original production expenditures outside of the 30-mile Los Angeles studio zone and for visual effects, musical scoring and track recording.</td></tr><tr><td>There is a $100 million annual cap for credits - $10 million is reserved for independent films chosen through a wage-based ranking system.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>2.New York</h3><p>While California has Hollywood, New York has similarly attractive options and the city that never sleeps. The film ""How to Be Single"" is an example of a recent movie shot in New York, though some publications lamented its portrayal of the city. People keep coming back for its famous landmarks and tax breaks such as:</p><table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;""><tbody><tr><td>A 30 percent refundable state tax credit with a 10 percent bonus for expenditures in certain upstate counties.</td></tr><tr><td>A 35 percent credit for post production expenditures under a stand-alone post program in some upstate counties.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The state splits qualification requirements, depending on whether films are Level 1 or Level 2. The former category requirements are:</p><table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;""><tbody><tr><td>A budget of less than $15 million, with less than 5 percent public ownership.</td></tr><tr><td>Shoot at least one day on a set built specifically for a production at a New York State Qualified Production Facility.</td></tr><tr><td>least 75 percent of all work-related expenses must be connected to work completed at the aforementioned QPF.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For Level 2 films the qualifications are:</p><table style=""width: 90%; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 10px; font-size: 14px;""><tbody><tr><td>Shoot on a set built specifically for the film at a QPF.</td></tr><tr><td>At least 75 percent of all work-related expenses must be connected to work completed at the aforementioned QPF.</td></tr><tr><td>At least 75 percent of shots outside the QPF must be within New York State or...</td></tr><tr><td>...The production should spend at least $3 million on work at the QPF.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The characters in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HowToBeSingle?src=hash"">#HowToBeSingle</a> manage not to take the subway even once. <a href=""https://t.co/P2TFNpd3kX"">https://t.co/P2TFNpd3kX</a></p><p>— L.A.

17896,"Key Terms to Negotiate in a Monmouth County Retail Lease","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Monmouth Mall is slated to undergo a $500 million facelift. According to owner Kushner Companies, the goal is to create a ""24/7 live, work and play environment,"" which will include high-end apartment units, a hotel, and revamped retail space.</h2><p>The redevelopment of the Eatontown mall reflects a changing landscape with regard to Monmouth County retail space. Traditional malls are struggling, with <a href=""http://www.greenstreetadvisors.com/"">two dozen malls having closed since 2010</a>. In addition, 60 others are on the cusp of shuttering, according to Green Street Advisors. </p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-17904"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Monmouth-County-Retail.jpg"" alt=""Key Terms to Negotiate in a Monmouth County Retail Lease"" width=""418"" height=""195"" /></p><p>So what does that mean for Monmouth County retail businesses? First, before signing a lease, it is important to do your homework. If the retail rental market is flooded with inventory and the shopping center has numerous vacancies, you can probably negotiate several landlord concessions. However, if the market is strong and/or you are pursuing a unique move-in ready space, you’ll have significantly less leverage.</p><p>In any case, Monmouth County retail tenants should never accept the landlord’s lease “as is.” Rather, it is advisable to work with <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/"">an experienced New Jersey commercial real estate lawyer who can negotiate a lease</a> and has your best interest in mind. Below are several key terms to address:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of lease:</strong></td><td>The type of lease will dictate how rent and other costs are calculated. In a triple net lease (the most common retail lease), the tenant is generally responsible for rent, property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance, and utilities. By comparison, under a percentage lease, the tenant is required to pay a set rent as well as a specified percentage of its income based on a formula which allows the tenant to recover the base rental income paid prior to sharing the excess with the Landlord.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build-out period:</strong></td><td>While the lease agreement provided by the landlord may not include it, the contract should allow time, typically 30-90 days, for the tenant to remodel the space, install fixtures, and move in inventory. The lease should also allow for the nonpayment of rent or at least a discounted rent equal to expenses for this time period.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Permitted use:</strong></td><td>Most retail leases contain a clause that specifies the allowable uses of the rental space. To allow for the greatest flexibility, it is wise to negotiate a broad provision that includes any related products and services.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Co-tenancy:</strong></td><td>This clause is essential if the premises features an “anchor” business, i.e. big box retailer that drives traffic to the shopping center. It provides that the tenant’s rent will be reduced if key tenants or a certain number of tenants leave the premises or close their operations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Non-competition:</strong></td><td>A non-compete or exclusivity clause helps ensure that your competition will not become your next-door neighbor. It specifically prohibits the landlord from renting any other retail spaces on the premises to a direct competitor.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Early termination:</strong></td><td>Retail businesses, particularly new ventures, should pay particular attention to the lease’s termination clauses and seek to limit the penalty for early termination should the business fail. It is also favorable to negotiate a sublease clause that authorizes the tenant to sublet the premises to another business.</td></tr></tbody></table>",,20160307,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/?p=17896,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Monmouth-County-Retail.jpg,Monmouth-County-Retail,,,"Key Terms to Negotiate in a Monmouth County Retail Lease",,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate","Monmouth County|Monmouth County Commercial Real Estate|Scarinci Hollenbeck",draft,46,negotiate-in-a-monmouth-county-retail-lease,,,0,0,closed,open

While apps can generate significant revenue for businesses, they also come with unique legal concerns.

Here are some of the top legal cerns that New Jersey Mobile app developers should know about it."" width=""544"" height=""254"" /></p><p>While the target audience and app content can dictate a number of specific compliance concerns, there are several issues that all app developers should address, including:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Business structure:</strong></td><td>For start-ups, it is essential to have a <a href=""/practices/partnerships/"">partnership agreement or other written agreement in place</a> that sets forth the ownership rights, responsibilities, and revenue share of the shareholders or partners. To limit liability, and, in some instances, to simplify fund raising to finance the expansion into this new business, existing businesses may form a separate subsidiary as a new entity that is dedicated to app development and sales. Having an existing traditional business demonstrates to potential investors that management has skills and experience needed to develop and grow a business.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vendor agreements: </strong></td><td>In many start-ups, the business owners and the app programmers are one and the same. However, if employees or outside developers are used, it is important to execute an assignment or a vendor agreement. Among other key terms, the contract should specify that all intellectual property and use rights will vest in the company paying the employee or outside developer. In addition, the contract should also include non-disclosure provisions that protect the confidentiality of the app being developed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intellectual property rights:</strong></td><td>App developers must also secure the <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">required licenses for any trademarked or copyrighted content used in the app or risk facing an infringement lawsuit.</a> Companies should also be mindful that the use of open source software still requires specific licensing procedures.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>End User License Agreement (EULA):</strong></td><td>Consumers who purchase mobile apps are technically receiving a license. The terms of use are typically set forth in an End User Licensing Agreement or EULA. While Apple provides a standard agreement for apps sold on the iOS platform, developers should consider drafting a custom EULA that addresses risks or needs specific to the particular app.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data collection and privacy:</strong></td><td>Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the data practices of mobile app developers. Therefore, it is important to have a detailed <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">data privacy policy that specifies what information is collected;</a> how is it stored; how the company uses the data; and whether it is shared with third parties.</td></tr></tbody></table>",,20160309,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/legal-concerns-facing-new-jersey-mobile-app-developers/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/New-Jersey-Mobile-App-Developers.jpg,New-Jersey-Mobile-App-Developers,,,"Designing a successful mobile application has become one of the fastest ways for a technology start-up to make it big.

Mr. Young will address the need for owners and operators to conduct self-audits to insure that they are in full compliance with Equal Pay requirements under both federal and state laws. The event, hosted annually by the <a href=""http://njra.com/"">New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association</a> (NJRHA), is the leading New Jersey restaurant conference each year.</p><p>Mr. Young, as well as other speakers, will share their expertise on a range of topics pertinent to restaurant owners and operators including liquor licensing, workplace safety, food inspection, public relations and social media.

The municipality is looking to balance the competing interests of attracting new businesses and protecting the character of the historic borough.</h2><p>Most New Jersey municipalities have sign ordinances that dictate the type, location, and size of signage. The goals of local regulations generally include protecting the character of the community and preventing visual “clutter” in downtown and other commercial districts. For instance, Red bank currently prohibits all billboards and blinking signs. In order to comply with the First Amendment, <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/municipal-sign-ordinance-violates-the-first-amendment-in-reed-v-town-of-gilbert/"" target=""_blank"">sign restrictions must be content-neutral</a>.

However, in order to avoid <a href=""/practices/public-law/"">running afoul of local ordinances</a>, companies must be sure to obtain the proper permits and verify that all proposed signage complies with the code. Failing to do so prior to ordering and installing signs can be a costly mistake. </p><h3>Amending Red Bank’s Sign Ordinance</h3><p>In Red Bank, government officials have been working for several years to streamline the municipality’s sign ordinance. The current debate is whether the proposal to amend the code goes far enough.</p><p>James Scavone, executive director of Red Bank River Center, has been a vocal critic. River Center, a non-profit organization, manages Red Bank’s Special Improvement District. “We feel the current draft is injurious to business development in Red Bank and I urge [the council] to reconsider its introduction,” <a href=""http://hub.gmnews.com/news/2016-03-03/Front_Page/The_signs_of_the_time_are_clearer_in_Red_Bank.html"">Scavone told The Hub</a>.</p><p>According to Scavone, the scaled-down version of the sign ordinance is still too burdensome on businesses and could hinder development. He notes that the sign code is still 14 pages long, which is twice the length of the sign regulations in towns like Princeton, Montclair and Cape May.</p><p>The proposed ordinance is scheduled for a public hearing on March 23, 2016. We will be closely following its progress and will post updates as they become available.</p>",,20160314,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/red-banks-sign-ordinance-stifling-business-growth/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Red-Bank-Sign-Ordinance.png,Red-Bank-Sign-Ordinance,,,"Red Bank Sign Ordinance Stifling Business Growth?",,"Firm Insights>Business Law","New Jersey|new jersey business|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,15,red-banks-sign-ordinance-stifling-business-growth,,,0,0,closed,open

Craft brewers can now sell beer for consumption on the premises in connection with a brewery tour, where they were previously limited to providing free four once samples. Patrons can also purchase 15.5 gallons or less (roughly a keg) for off premises consumption, which is a significantly increase over the two six-packs allowed under the prior law.</p><p>The license application fees for the Limited Brewery License range from $1,250 to $7,500 and are dependent upon production capacity.

By comparison, there were eight breweries in the state prior to the law change. Despite the growth, the Brewers Association still ranks New Jersey 48th among the 50 states and District of Columbia in breweries per capita.</p><p>Legislation is also currently pending that would allow further expansion of New Jersey breweries. One bill (<a href=""http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A2000/1951_I1.HTM"">Assembly Bill 1951</a>) would allow brew pubs to annually sell and distribute up to 1,000 barrels of malt alcoholic beverages to State-licensed retailers and retailers licensed in other states. Under current law, a restricted brewery is required to be operated in conjunction with an adjoining restaurant. In addition, any beer that its brewed may only be delivered to that restaurant premises and to licensed wholesalers.</p><p>Other measures under consideration would create new ways for breweries to market and sell their products. One bill allows the holder of a limited or restricted brewery license to sell beer at a community farm market. Additional legislation would require the Division of Travel and Tourism to advertise and promote tours of breweries in the state.</p>",,20160317,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/new-laws-fostering-brewery-startups-monmouth-county/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Brewery-Startups-in-Monmouth-County.jpg,Brewery-Startups-in-Monmouth-County,,,"Brewery Startups in Monmouth County are growing, largely due to relaxed regulations that New Jersey adopted a few years ago.

However, not all contract breaches are created equal. A “material” breach is so significant that it reaches the core of the agreement and negatively impacts its entire outcome. In contrast, a “non-material” breach often involves less important details.</h2><p>The distinction between a material and non-material contract breach impacts the <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">legal recourse available to a Monmouth County business</a>.

If so, it will generally find a material breach.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>What was the intent of the parties?</strong> If the court finds that the breaching party acted unfairly or in bad faith, it is more likely to characterize the breach as material.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>How easy is it to rectify the breach?</strong> If the problem could be remedied using reasonable effort and expense, the court is more likely to find a minor breach.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>How will the breaching party be impacted if the other party is not obligated to perform?</strong> Even though the breaching party may be responsible for the problem, the court will still evaluate the severity of the impact (e.g., forfeiture) if the non-breaching party’s performance is excused.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Does the contract address breaches?</strong>In some case, the terms of the contract specify what constitutes a material breach.

To identify violations, the EPA will likely rely on discharge monitoring reports (DMRs) as well as the CWA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program.</p><p>The EPA also plans to increase scrutiny over facilities that make, use and store extremely hazardous substances. As highlighted by the agency, catastrophic accidents at these facilities—historically about 150 each year—result in fatalities and serious injuries, evacuations, and risk of harm to health and the environment. The EPA plans to reduce the risks of accidents through “innovative accident prevention measures, and improving response capabilities.” According to the agency, it has already designed 2,000 facilities as ‘‘high-risk’’ due to their proximity to densely populated areas, the quantity and number of extremely hazardous substances they use, or their history of significant accidents.</p><p>The EPA will continue to target leaks, flares, and excess emissions from refineries, chemical plants and other industries that emit hazardous air pollutants. The EPA also plans to expand its hazardous air pollutants initiative to include air toxics violations at facilities that generate, treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The Message for New Jersey Businesses</strong></p><p>Owners and operators of facilities in industries that are the subject of NEIs should be prepared for increased scrutiny from the EPA. In addition, should the agency identify violations, there is an increased risk of both civil and criminal liability with regard to NEIs. </p><p>Also of note, <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/compliance/next-generation-compliance"" target=""_blank"">EPA intends to employ Next Generation Compliance strategies</a> with regard to the NEIs identified for FY 2017-2019. This enforcement approach consists of five interconnected components: designing regulations and permits that are easier to implement, using advanced emissions/pollutant detection technology, implementing electronic reporting, expanding transparency by making information public, and adopting innovative enforcement approaches (e.g., data analytics and targeting).</p><p>The EPA has already started to incorporate Next Gen compliance tools into its civil judicial and administrative settlements. Examples include requiring: advanced monitoring, such as point source emission/discharge monitoring and ambient monitoring, independent third party verification of compliance with settlement obligations, and public accountability through increased transparency of compliance data.</p>",,20160323,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/epa-announces-national-enforcement-initiatives/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/National-Enforcement-Initiatives.jpg,National-Enforcement-Initiatives,,,"The U.S. Department of Environmental Protection recently announced its national enforcement initiatives for the next three years.

This legal principle is commonly referred to as “first in time, first in right.”</p><p>Despite this seemingly harsh rule, most tenants should have certain protections pursuant to their lease documents. Specifically, you will need to look at your lease documents to see if you have signed <em>a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement.</em></p><p>The landlord, tenant, and lender all generally sign the SDNA agreement. It outlines how a foreclosure, refinance, or sale of the leased property will impact each party’s respective rights and liabilities. In particular, it will stipulate whether the lender or other new landlord must agree not to disturb the occupancy of the tenant (as long as it has complied with all of the other lease terms) and provided the tenant attorns to the new landlord.</p><p>In the event that your lease does not contain these protections, the new landlord can ask you to sign a new lease, which may contain less favorable terms. In the worst-case scenario, the new landlord could seek an eviction. However, in the current economy, most landlords are happy to keep good tenants who pay their rent on time.</p><p>Finally, SDNA agreements are generally legal complex documents. Therefore, if you are concerned about the potential impact of a foreclosure on your business operations, it is best to consult with an <a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/Practices/Business%20Law.htm"">experienced business attorney</a>.</p>",,20120223,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/real-estate-environmental/happens-tenants-commercial-foreclosure/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Commercial-Foreclosure.jpg,Commercial-Foreclosure,,,,,"Firm Insights>Commercial Real Estate","New Jersey|new jersey business|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,46,happens-tenants-commercial-foreclosure,,,0,0,closed,open

However, courts are still determining how best to apply traditional contract law to emails, text messages, and other types of electronic communication.</p><p>In any case, the basic principles of contract law still apply. In order for a <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business"" target=""_blank"">business contract to be enforceable</a>, there must be a valid offer and acceptance, supported by consideration. If one party sends a text message or email proposing different terms, the offer is considered rejected, and the contract formation process starts fresh. In addition, the parties must also intend to be contractually bound. While intent need not be expressly conveyed in the electronic communication, it must be clear that the parties intended that the agreement be legally binding.</p><h2>Tips for text message contract negotiations</h2><p>To avoid a costly breach of contract lawsuit, below are five <a href=""/year-in-review-top-contract-tips-for-new-york-and-new-jersey-businesses/"" target=""_blank"">tips for text message contract negotiations</a>, email or other form of electronic communication:</p><ul><li><strong>Expressly convey your intentions</strong>. The court will analyze what you said during text message contract negotiations, not your subjective intentions, when evaluating whether a valid contract has been formed. Therefore, it is imperative to memorialize everything in writing.  In New York, recent decisions indicate that the court is likely to view whether or not you put your name at the end of your message as an indicator of intent to form an agreement.</li><li><strong>Put the other party on notice</strong>. If you do not want to be bound by the terms discussed via text or email, make it clear to the other party that your electronic correspondence should be considered non-binding, and that any agreement is contingent upon the execution of a physically executed, formal written contract.</li><li><strong>Clear up any confusion</strong>. If you suspect that the other party may be interpreting your email exchange as the basis for a binding contract, it is imperative to take swift action, in writing, to correct any misconceptions.</li><li><strong>Be mindful of accidental contract amendment</strong>. Texts and emails can also amend the terms of an existing agreement. Therefore, it is important to be equally mindful that you do not unknowingly waive or modify an important contract term via electronic correspondence.</li><li><strong>Train your employees</strong>. Make sure your employees understand the risks of negotiating via electronic correspondence, including the unintentional formation of a binding agreement.</li></ul><p>As a business owner do you find yourself making text message contract negotiations?

Board of Review</a></em>,</span> was receiving $600 in unemployment compensation when she traveled to Jamaica to serve as the maid of honor in her sister’s wedding. After the wedding, she flew to the United States Virgin Islands to visit her husband's parents, who were unwell. In total, she was out of the country for roughly two weeks.</p><p>The Department of Labor and Workforce Development Board of Review found Vialet was ineligible to receive unemployment compensation for the time she was overseas. The Board relied on N.J.S.A. 43:21-4(c)(1), which provides that an unemployed individual may receive benefits for any week in which ""[t]he individual is able to work, and is available for work, and has demonstrated to be actively seeking work.""</p><p>On appeal, Vialet argued that the Board interpreted the ""availability"" requirement under the statute too strictly by requiring her physical presence in the country. She further maintained that the interpretation ignores the availability of the Internet to search for work and communicate with prospective employers from virtually any location.</p><p>Conversely, the Board of Review contended that under the ""availability to work"" test articulated in <em>Krauss v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc</em>., 13 N.J. 447, 457-58 (1953) still applied. It required Vialet to show that while she was overseas, she was willing, able, and ready to accept suitable work that she would not have had ""good cause to refuse,"" and that she was still ""genuinely attached to the labor market.""</p><p>The Appellate Division ultimately confirmed that Vialet was ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits during the time period in question, despite her ability to search for jobs online. “Although the modern marketplace and the environment in which employment opportunities arise may have dramatically changed since <em>Krauss</em> and <em>Vazquez</em> were decided, the principles, articulated in those decisions, defining ‘availability’ under N.J.S.A. 43:21-4(c)(1) remain legally viable and are readily applicable to this case,” the court concluded.</p><p>The court further noted that even if Vialet was able to conduct her employment search from outside the country, she was still not available to immediately start a job, if hired. As the court explained, “Her efforts to remain electronically linked to the marketplace did not overcome her physical absence because, by her own admission, she would not have been able to start any prospective job until January 2011.”</p><p><em>If you have any questions about this case or other unemployment compensation related issues, please contact me, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/associates/christina-m-michelson/"">Christina Michelson</a></span>, or the </em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/""><em>Scarinci Hollenbeck</em></a></span><em> attorney with whom you work. </em></p>",,20121114,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/new-jersey-court-finds-overseas-job-search-not-sufficient-collect-unemployment-compensation/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unemployment.jpg,unemployment,,,,,"Firm Insights>Labor &amp; Employment",,publish,25,new-jersey-court-finds-overseas-job-search-not-sufficient-collect-unemployment-compensation,,,0,0,closed,open
18082,"Are Performance Reviews Becoming Passé? Five Tips for Re-tooling Your Policy","<h2>For supervisors and their reports, the requirement for conducting performance reviews has been an annual rite that both sides have endured at sufferance. The quality of the process and its purpose is rarely evaluated or questioned.  However, this is increasingly not true as businesses are beginning to cast aside formal employee reviews in favor of less structured, more flexible evaluations.</h2><p>Accenture, one of the world’s largest employers, recently announced that it would no longer require its 330,000 employees to undergo annual performance reviews. In addition, the company is also abandoning its forced ranking system in favor of a system in which workers receive regular feedback from their supervisors.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18083"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Performance-Reviews.gif"" alt=""Performance Reviews"" width=""414"" height=""193"" /></p><p>""All this terminology of rankings -- forcing rankings along some distribution curve or whatever -- we're done with that,"" <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2015/07/21/in-big-move-accenture-will-get-rid-of-annual-performance-reviews-and-rankings/"" target=""_blank"">Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme told <em>The Washington Post</em>.</a> ""We're going to evaluate you in your role, not vis-a-vis someone else who might work in Washington, who might work in Bangalore. It's irrelevant. It should be about you.""</p><p>This decision <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"" target=""_blank"">reflects a growing employment law trend</a>. Six percent of Fortune 500 companies have eliminated rankings, according to the management research firm CEB. Other notable companies that have made similar changes to their performance evaluation procedures include Deloitte, Gap, Adobe, and Medtronic.</p><p>Understandably, many New York and New Jersey businesses are beginning to question if they should follow this example. Is there a happy medium between forced rankings and random performance conversations?</p><h2>Why you should re-vamp your performance reviews</h2><p>In lieu of total abandonment, it makes sense for employers to at least re-tool their performance review process. This is because reviews are almost always performed by supervisors with no training for the job and with no attempt at obtaining quality control over the results. The supervisors charged with the task typically judge the job performance assignment to be an unwanted, thankless task that gets in the way of the mission of making money.</p><p>The reviews are often slapped together with little or no careful or structured thought.  This then results, at times, with an employee being terminated for alleged lack of performance or incompetence but whose formal reviews provide glowing (and glaring) contradictions undermining the stated reason(s) for the negative employment action. Furthermore, there are often gross discrepancies and disparate assessments among the persons conducting the reviews.  For one reviewer, a 5 (out of 10) is a failing grade while the next reviewer regards this as a high mark</p><h2>Things to keep in mind for performance reviews</h2><p>If employee reviews are to be performed, it is very important that the employer:</p><ul><li>Take the process seriously and devote sufficient resources to do the job “right;”</li><li>Choose the criteria that are to be the measures of performance carefully; question whether such criteria are really relevant to performance;</li><li>Train the reviewers to help them understand their role and the expectation to include attempting to achieve a more uniform application of the stated criteria;</li><li>Review the results on a preliminary basis to spot negative trends and anomalies in the scoring;</li><li>Curve the scores so that there is some consistency of the results from one reviewer to another; and</li><li>Define the purposes and consequences for the reviews, and appropriately apply the approved use(s) for the results (retention, promotion, raises).</li></ul><p>Generally, most employers have been unwilling to devote the time and resources to these efforts.  The consequence can be the assertion of an employment or discrimination claim that will be difficult to defend. Rather than being unduly exposed to such claims, the defendant-employer would be better off with no review than one that has been poorly executed.</p>",,20150730,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/performance-reviews-becoming-passe/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Performance-Reviews.gif,"Performance Reviews",,,"Performance Reviews",,"Firm Insights>Labor &amp; Employment","Labor &amp; Employment|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,31,performance-reviews-becoming-passe,,,0,0,closed,open

As a result, Monmouth County employers may have concerns about the legality of March Madness office pools as well as their effect on office productivity.</h2><p>State law largely governs unlicensed gambling, such as March madness office pools.

If a company wants to prohibit office pools for business reasons, it should create a clear written policy.

If so, you could be hurting your employees’ productivity with these after hours emails and maybe even exposing your company to legal liability.</h2><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18106"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/After-Hours-Emails.jpg"" alt=""Are After Hours Emails Hurting Your Business?"" width=""409"" height=""191"" /></p><p>In today’s world, employees frequently receive after hours emails on their personal mobile devices. While it can be convenient when working away from the physical office, it can also make workers feel that like they are chained to the metaphysical office 24/7. As highlighted in a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/03/your-late-night-emails-are-hurting-your-team"" target=""_blank""><u>maintaining </u>distance from the workplace is actually critical to maintaining productivity.</a></p><p>When their bosses send after-hours emails, workers feel compelled to respond. However, constantly checking mobile devices on the weekends and after work can interfere with valuable down time. “Time away produces new ideas and fresh insights,” Maura Thomas writes. “But your employees can never disconnect when they’re always reaching for their devices to see if you’ve emailed. Creativity, inspiration, and motivation are your competitive advantage, but they are also depletable resources that need to be recharged.”</p><p>To discourage off-hour communications, some businesses have implemented email policies that include specific “quiet times.” For instance, companies may specify that business emails should not be sent between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekdays and at any time on the weekend. Of course, there are exceptions for emergency situations. In addition, employees are still free to work during the quiet times and even compose draft emails to be sent later. The point is that their subordinates and/or colleagues should not feel compelled to follow suit.</p><p><strong>After-Hours Email and the FLSA</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>Off-the-clock communications can also lead to <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">wage and hour employment lawsuits under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)</a>. For nonexempt employees, responding to emails and text messages could very well be considered compensable time as a matter of law.  Being outside the office has never limited what is work time, and this is especially true in the age of working remotely and electronically.</p><p>As a matter of law, all time that a non-exempt employee spends on work-related activities is “<strong>work time</strong>,” whether on premises and/or whether ""<strong>required</strong>"" or not.  ""Voluntary"" work is still work and must be compensated. Similarly, even work that is “unauthorized"" or ""unapproved"" is compensable provided the employer knew <strong>or should have known</strong> it was being done. This is because the employer has the right and the legal responsibility to control the work of its employees. The law provides that an employer may not accept the theoretical benefit of work without paying for it.</p><p>Given the proliferation of smartphones, it is not surprising that overtime suits involving electronic communications are on the rise. However, the Department of Labor has yet to provide guidance, and the case law is still evolving in this area.</p><p>In many cases, liability depends on whether responding to email after hours is considered de minimis work and, therefore, non-compensable under the FLSA. The factors a court will consider include (1) the practical administrative difficulty of recording the additional time; (2) the aggregate amount of compensable time; and (3) the regularity of the additional work. So while the five minutes it may take to respond to an occasional email is unlikely to result in liability, a regular practice of requiring (or permitting) hourly workers to respond to after-hours messages could trigger a wage lawsuit.</p><p>Given the risks, today’s businesses should have policies in place regarding how employees should address emails and text messages sent or received outside of working hours. If workers are given the ability to remotely access communications on smartphones and other devices, companies should provide a means for nonexempt employees to record their time and obtain legally required compensation. </p>",,-00011130,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/?p=18102,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/After-Hours-Emails.jpg,After-Hours-Emails,,,"Are After Hours Emails Hurting Your Business?",,"Firm Insights>Labor &amp; Employment","Labor &amp; Employment|Labor and Employment Law|Scarinci Hollenbeck",draft,31,hours-emails-hurting-monmouth-county-business,,,0,0,closed,open

18156,"Do Your Human Resources Records Need a Spring Cleaning?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">As the weather begins to turn warmer, many of us get the itch for a little “spring cleaning.” For small businesses, your efforts should not stop at home. It is also good idea to channel this energy into reviewing, organizing, and purging your human resources records.</h2><p>Properly maintaining human resources records has several distinct advantages for employers. First, thorough and accurate recordkeeping allows you to quickly find information about your employees, saving both time and money. In addition, it may even assist in <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/"">shielding you from liability in the event of an employee lawsuit</a> or government audit.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18159"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/human-resources-records.jpg"" alt=""Properly maintaining human resources records has several distinct advantages for employers."" width=""405"" height=""189"" /></p><p><strong>Reviewing</strong>: During any HR records audit, it is important to review a cross-section of personnel files to ensure that they comply with applicable state and federal employment laws. While personnel files should include resumes, applications, performance evaluations, and employment contracts and other records, there are also some records that must be retained. Employers are required to keep certain information about employees’ wages and hours, including hours worked, total wages, and deductions.</p><p><strong>Updating</strong>: It is also important to verify that all of your Human Resources records are up to date. For instance, you should make sure that the file contains documents reflecting any recent promotions, disciplinary actions, raises, performance reviews, etc. In addition, records management procedures should also be updated to comply with any employment law changes. For instance, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes a number of new record keeping obligations on employers.</p><p><strong>Organizing</strong>: Keeping detailed records is not helpful unless you can easily access them. If you do not have <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/is-poor-contract-management-hurting-your-bottom-line/"">standardized record management policies and procedures</a>, this is a good time to start. For employers, it is important to make sure that documents make it into the correct files. For instance, I-9 forms, investigative documents, and medical records (including Family and Medical Leave Act forms, Leaves of Absence forms, and the Americans with Disabilities Act information) should be maintained separately and not placed in employees’ general personnel files.</p><p><strong>Purging</strong>: Upon reviewing your personnel files, you may find documents that are outdated or reference employees that are no longer with the company. However, before throwing away any documents, be sure to check any applicable state or federal document retention requirements. For instance, employers are required to preserve at least <em>three </em>years of payroll records, while records on which wage computations are based should be retained for <em>two</em> years.  Please keep in mind that, once you are aware of threatened, anticipated or served litigation, the requirement to preserve evidence (“Litigation Hold”) supersedes standard document destruction practices.</p>",,20160405,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/human-resources-records-spring-cleaning/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/human-resources-records.jpg,human-resources-records,,,"Properly maintaining human resources records has several distinct advantages for employers.",,"Firm Insights>Labor &amp; Employment","Labor &amp; Employment|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,31,human-resources-records-spring-cleaning,,,0,0,closed,open

<p><strong>Lyndhurst, NJ – April 6, 2016</strong> – The Township of Mahwah and a group of fourteen New Jersey municipalities plan to call upon Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner John Scagnelli, Chair of the firm’s Environmental and Land Use Group, for legal assistance relating to the proposed Pilgrim Oil Pipeline. This includes drawing up a “model ordinance” against the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline, according to a recent article in the Bergen Record. Mr. Scagnelli, who is Environmental Counsel to the New Jersey League of Municipalities, is an acknowledged expert on issues relating to several New Jersey pipeline projects which are either already approved or proposed in the State. Mahwah Township Council President John Roth stated that he will be also calling upon Scagnelli to develop an opinion about the role and authority of the New Jersey Highlands Council, the agency overseeing the region, in approving an interstate oil pipeline and he will represent the group before the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
<p>By way of background, the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline consists of two parallel pipelines that would run from the Port of Albany to Linden, NJ, along the New York State Thruway for 170 miles just to the west of the Hudson River.</p>
<p>Advocates for the pipeline contend that it will result in reduced heat and electrical costs, spur job creation, reduce traffic, and result in less pollution.  Pipeline opponents contend that the pipelines will cross preserved open space and farmland and infringe on local land use decisions and property rights.</p>
<p>In a number of communities along the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline’s projected route from Mahwah to Linden, discussions have focused on whether municipal governments will be able to fill a possible regulatory vacuum. The federal and state governments apparently do not regulate the routes of such pipelines, and as a result, officials in many municipalities, who fear catastrophic oil spills, are in the process of determining whether local bans on pipelines such as this one would stand up to potentially costly legal challenges.</p>

18189,"Does using drones in filmmaking fly with the government?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Drones in filmmaking may be changing the way films are being made, but they're also raising plenty of legal questions.</h2>
<p>Filmmakers can offer audiences a new perspective when they use drones, but these flying machines are the subject of plenty of legal scrutiny. Though certainly helpful in many ways, drones in filmmaking can  however be considered a threat to privacy rights as well as a safety hazard. The federal government has asserted its right to regulate the use of drones through the Federal Aviation Administration, but in some instances has also conceded that filmmakers have the right to use them for shooting.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18195"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/drones-in-filmmaking.jpg"" alt=""Drones in filmmaking may be changing the way films are being made, but they're also raising plenty of legal questions."" width=""403"" height=""188"" /></p>
<p><strong>Basic drone in filmmaking regulations </strong><br />
 Any filmmaker who hopes to use a drone to capture their scenes from a unique angle must first consider basic laws regulating the devices. Luckily, AllDigital Inc. compiled most of the rules <a href=""http://nofilmschool.com/2016/03/drone-shooting-laws"" target=""_blank"">regulating drone use</a> and squeezed them into one infographic. Here are the relevant legal tips for filmmakers who plan to use drones:</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle; padding: 1%;"">
	<li>Drone owners are required to register with the FAA before they fly.</li>
	<li>Drones should display unique registration numbers.</li>
	<li>The registration process differs for drones that weigh more than 55 pounds.</li>
	<li>It is illegal to fly over national parks, military bases, sporting events and stadiums, emergency response sites, within 5 miles of airports, over 400 feet or within 25 feet of another person.</li>
	<li>Videographers are required to file for a Section 333 exemption.</li>
	<li>Filmmakers must file for the Section 333 exemption 120 days before shooting.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are several state-specific regulations that filmmakers have to follow. Some of these states also serve as popular filming locations.</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle; padding: 1%;"">
	<li>In California it is illegal to fly a drone over private property without permission from the owner.</li>
	<li>In New York City drone owners could soon need licensure and insurance.</li>
	<li>In Texas only certain professionals can use drones to capture images, and individuals in the film or photos cannot be identifiable.</li>
	<li>In Chicago it is illegal to fly drones between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. It is also against the law to fly over someone else's property.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Video shot using drones protected by the First Amendment </strong><br />
 Other states and localities have or are working on their own drone regulations. Wherever filmmakers are shooting, it is important to first determine what local regulations regarding drone use are. However, the FAA has conceded that filmmakers do have certain rights when it comes to using drones, as robotics and drone expert Ryan Calo tweeted about at the time of the announcement.</p>
<p>[tweet https://twitter.com/rcalo/status/587798358607077377 width='100' align='center']</p>
<p>The FAA acknowledged that drone users have a First Amendment right to post and share footage <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Notice/N_8900.292.pdf"" target=""_blank"">shot with the machines</a>. This is a significant victory for filmmakers who feared the government might take action against them for posting video they shot online. Drones are an undeniably useful tool when it comes to making movies and television shows. But the machines are also undeniably tough to regulate. They will only become more popular in the coming years, both for filmmakers and other commercial purposes.</p>
<p>""Whenever you have a tool at your disposal that allows you to tell the story more efficiently and more poignantly, <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/drones-invade-hollywood-1427410534"" target=""_blank"">you use it</a>,"" Pieter Jan Brugge, executive producer of Amazon's series Bosch, told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Filmmakers will continue to use drones to enhance their projects, its just the question of how that will always need answering, especially in these formative years for regulation. These devices can be dangerous and are a threat to privacy in the wrong hands. To capitalize on the creative potential drones hold, filmmakers have to be careful to understand the law regulating them.</p>

18197,"Traps to avoid when Buying or Selling A Business?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Small businesses are exchanging hands at a rapid rate throughout the country. The current economic conditions are favorable for both buying and selling a business.</h2><p>Whether you are interested in buying or selling a business, preparation is the key to success. Once you decide to sell your business, <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/selling-your-business-tips-for-surviving-due-diligence/"" target=""_blank"">it is time to begin preparing for due diligence</a>. In fact, most experts recommend that business owners begin the process of preparing to sell a small business well before it is actually ready for sale, so that you can maximize the value and the price you will receive.  You do not want to first be learning about blemishes and problems at the time you are negotiating the sale with the potential buyer.  The buyer will be looking for the problems, and may try to exaggerate their importance, as part of both the due diligence and the price negotiation processes.  </p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18199"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Monmouth-County-Business.jpg"" alt=""Traps to avoid when Buying or Selling A Monmouth County Business?"" width=""405"" height=""189"" /></p><p>Prospective purchasers will want to review your financial records, such as a current balance sheet, profit and loss statements, tax returns, and accounts payable and receivable. Therefore, it is advisable to solidify your company’s financial health and banking relationship and get all of your corporate paperwork in order. Potential buyers will also want information about key business contracts, employees, and intellectual property, so owners should be sure to protect the confidentiality of key business data via a nondisclosure and non-circumvention agreement. Consider how to incentivize any key employee to remain with the business in the event of a sale; all employees who access confidential information should sign an acknowledgment and confidentiality agreement. You should do what you have been putting off doing: throw out old and un-needed files, clean and paint as you would do if selling your house. Promote the business instead of just relying on repeat customers (it will show that the business can be readily expanded) as evidence justifying the price multiple you are seeking.  And don’t forget to do the personal research on the buyer that the buyer is probably doing about you.</p><p>For entrepreneurs who are <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/thinking-of-buying-a-new-york-or-new-jersey-business-make-sure-to-do-your-homework/"" target=""_blank"">interested in buying a business</a>, due diligence is also a key part of the process. While buying an existing New Jersey business can be less risky than starting from scratch, this only applies if you do your research. Don’t just look at the present physical plant, employees and ownership; research the history of the business and its ownership, including, of course any past, current or potential litigation.  Look into past problems and future plans for the area the business serves. How long do employees stay with the company, and how difficult is it to find capable, trained replacements. Who are the suppliers, and what is the history regarding rising cost of goods? Most important: find out why the business is for sale. I mean the <em>real </em>reason.  </p><p>Most importantly, it is important to know what you will be getting — from the financial condition of the company to the existing employees to the building lease. In many cases, it is advisable to hold back a percentage of the purchase price for a certain amount of time, i.e. six months, to account for any unexpected costs or liabilities. With regard to getting a fair price, it is advisable to retain an experienced advisor, or for larger transactions, an appraiser who can provide a detailed valuation of all of the company’s assets, including inventory, equipment, and intellectual property.  You should be a customer of the business (or have someone you trust act in that capacity), so you can get a feel of how the business you will be taking over treats its customers, or how the business might be improved to enhance its after-purchase value.</p><p>As detailed by Score.org, the <a href=""https://www.score.org/blog/2016/bridget-weston-pollack/thinking-about-buying-or-selling-small-business"" target=""_blank"">sales of small businesses have grown significantly</a> over the past several years. In 2012, 4,730 businesses were sold; by comparison, 7,222 businesses exchanged hands in 2015. Last year, the restaurant industry saw the most sales, accounting for 22 percent of all transactions.</p><p>Prices of other small businesses are also on the rise, according to data gathered by Score.org. In 2012, the median asking price was $187,000 with a sales price of $164,000. Prices have steadily increased, with the average asking price climbing to $225,000 and the average sales price rising to $199,000 in 2015. </p><p>Whether the business being sold is small or large, the same rules apply: if you are the seller, make sure the buyer who is not paying cash properly securitizes any post-closing payments; and, if you are the buyer –<em>caveat emptor</em>.</p>",,20160411,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/traps-to-avoid-when-buying-or-selling-a-business/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Monmouth-County-Business.jpg,Monmouth-County-Business,,,"Traps to avoid when Buying or Selling A Monmouth County Business?",,"Firm Insights>Business Law","business law|New Jersey|new jersey business|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,26,traps-to-avoid-when-buying-or-selling-a-business,,,0,0,closed,open

While the agreement may seem like a formality, the real estate contract is often the most essential part of the transaction. "" width=""407"" height=""190"" /></p><p>Contract law largely governs real estate agreements. Under New Jersey’s Statute of Frauds, real estate contracts must be signed and in writing to be enforceable. This includes purchase and sale agreements and property leases. The law does not specify the contents of the agreement, but an enforceable contract must generally identify the parties, describe the subject property and establish the essential terms of the agreement (e.g., price). The rest is up to the parties.</p><p>As a result, parties often memorialize purchase agreements or leases using pre-printed forms that include the basic elements required to formalize an agreement. While these agreements may save time and money, they are not tailored to reflect the specific circumstances of the parties or the property. Therefore, they may not adequately protect the parties’ legal rights.  While a pre-printed form is often used by brokers in connection with residential sales such forms lack the detail and sophistication generally necessary in a commercial setting.  In addition, commercial sales require attention to a variety of tax, transfer and cancellation rights and options that vary substantially from the basic pre-printed forms.</p><p>Common contract provisions not found in most standard agreements include contingencies and inspections. For instance, residential buyers may want to include a contingency relieving performance if they are unable to secure financing. In commercial transactions, buyers may want to <a href=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/environmental-and-land-use/"">investigate the zoning of the property or potential environmental liabilities</a> prior to closing the deal.<strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><strong>Negotiating a real estate agreement</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>The terms of a real estate agreement can always be negotiated, even if you are presented with a “standard” contract form.

A “house” stock or fund is one in which the brokerage firm maintains a position or has sponsored and recommends frequently to its customers because it makes a greater profit on such sales than on other securities. The firm motivates its brokers for such house stock transactions by offering them a greater share of the mark-up or commission involved than the broker would receive for other transactions that are not “house” stocks or funds. Even one such switching transaction can be the basis for a claim of churning.  Your broker’s sales of energy industry stocks that resulted in purchases of other energy industry stocks with the proceeds of the sales would have led to substantial losses in your account when the energy industry recently suffered a meltdown.  Those losses may be recoverable in FINRA arbitration proceedings you can bring against your brokerage firm.</p><p>Claims for proceeds trading, as with other claims against stock brokers and brokerage firms, are almost invariably resolved in arbitration or mediation through FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  This is because when you opened your brokerage account you were required to sign an opening account agreement that contains a mandatory arbitration clause. It is in bold print on the form you signed.  The arbitration clause is routinely enforced by the courts.</p><p>Customers need to look at their statements each month and, if a sale is immediately followed by a purchase of a similar security or a different security in a related industry, the broker should be asked to justify the rationale for the transactions. This should be done in writing, although brokers are supposed to make written note of any customer complaint, written or oral. Brokers rely on the passage of time to show that their customers ratified the transactions, arguing that the customer only complained later when losses were suffered.  Customers should monitor the confirmations and monthly statements they receive for any signs of suspicious activities. We have often been able to amicably resolve customer issues with their brokers through correspondence, conferences and mediation, so that is almost always worth considering. </p><p><em>If you have any questions about proceeds trading or would like to discuss any other broker negligence or investment fraud concerns, please contact me at <a href=""mailto:dbrecher@sh-law.com"">dbrecher@sh-law.com</a></em></p>",,20160415,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/wary-proceeds-trading-brokerage-account/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Proceeds-Trading.png,Proceeds-Trading,,,"Be Wary of Proceeds Trading in Your Brokerage Account",,"Firm Insights>Business Law","business law|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,26,wary-proceeds-trading-brokerage-account,,,0,0,closed,open

18237,"Financing your business in Red Bank","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Are you interested in starting a business in Red Bank?</h2><p>It is no secret that Red Bank has become one of the hottest commercial real estate sectors in the tri-state area. In one of the firm’s recent press releases, Kenneth Hollenbeck, our firm Managing Partner, explained that Red Bank, and Monmouth County in general, is an area that has boomed in recent years</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18274"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/business-ins-red-bank.jpg"" alt=""business-in-red-bank"" width=""409"" height=""191"" /></p><p>""We are excited about the continued growth prospects from our Monmouth County presence, and look forward to serving both local and national clients from our new Red Bank location,"" according to Hollenbeck.</p><p>With close to 400 businesses, Red Bank has become a vibrant business sector. It now offers the same amenities as Midtown Manhattan and nearby Jersey City and Hoboken with everything from schools, industry and tech to retail, dining and entertainment. There is also the attraction of beaches and desirable destinations that draw a large number of residents and visitors from the tri-state area. Based on all of these factors, combined with convenience and value, Red Bank recorded more than <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/small-business/best-places-start-business-new-jersey-2015/"">$6.75 million in average annual revenue</a> per business in 2015, the second best in the top 10 cities in New Jersey, according to a NerdWallet report.</p><p>With this increased demand for commercial space in the historic area, many entrepreneurs are seeking to set up shop there. But they are not sure how to go about doing it. Aside from filing the necessary paperwork with the borough for a certificate of occupancy, or even winning approval from the borough planning board, many small entrepreneurs are wondering how to finance their business in many of the town's upscale locations.</p><p>There are several options for entrepreneurs and start-up companies to secure funding for their businesses in the area. Many entrepreneurs opt for private lending channels, but the state of New Jersey has several lending and grant options available in which many may not be aware.<br /> <br /> These business accelerator programs are intended to boost the local economies of certain regions. It is one of the state's latest efforts to support small companies in the early stages of development and start-ups.<br /> <br /> These options can be instrumental in<a href=""/practices/commercial-real-estate/""> securing commercial space in Red Bank</a> because it is premier real estate, and purchasing and leasing commercial space in the area will not come cheap. But listed below are some potential options to explore:<br /> <i></i><br /> Many of these lending programs from private banking and third-party institutions are ideal for start-ups and small businesses. This may seem an obvious point, but depending on the financier, private loans may be most beneficial to entrepreneurs because of the flexible repayment options with 6-18 month loan terms or fixed and variable payment schedules. Several types of these loans are also tax deductible, require no collateral with creditworthiness and may be renewable upon completion of the original terms.</p><p><strong><i>New Jersey's small to mid-size business assistance programs</i></strong><br /> There are several lending programs for small to mid-size businesses offered by the state. Among the most popular offered include the Grow NJ Assistance Program, HMO Assistance Fund Tax Credit and New Jersey's Small Business Set-Aside Program.<br /> <br /> The state has numerous subsidiary agencies for entrepreneurs such as the New Jersey Business Incubation Network, Export-Import Bank of the United States Export Financing Assistance, Union County Economic Development Corporation's Small Business Services, U.S. Small Business Administration Export Financing Assistance and the U.S. Small Business Administration's New Jersey District Office. These providers offer loans and bond financing options for a variety of legal sector as well as industrial and retail business sectors.<br /> <br /> Among the more feasible options offered by the Economic Development Authority is the Premier Lending Program. This program develops opportunities for small businesses and start-ups with low-cost borrowing opportunities and a faster turnaround than most lending programs.<br /> <br /> <strong><i>Direct loans</i></strong><br /> The Economic Development Authority also offers direct loans. This agreement from the state offers entrepreneurs loans when financing is not available under any other Economic Development Authority programs. These direct loans are intended as a stimulus package for job creation and retention.<br /> <br /> <strong><i>Small Business Fund</i></strong><br /> The Small Business Fund is a grant program designed specifically for creditworthy small businesses that are minority- or women-owned. This financing option is ideal for an entrepreneur like an attorney in Red Bank because of its small but elite downtown locations. With this type of loan, minority and female entrepreneurs have access to financing that they would not otherwise have access to from a banking institution.<br /> <br /> <strong><i>New Jersey Business Growth Fund</i></strong><br /> This program is a joint venture between the Economic Development Authority and PNC Bank as part of an initiative to create more jobs. Many small to mid-size businesses may be eligible to financing that would not otherwise be available to them through this fund.<br /> <br /> <strong><i>New Jersey Advantage Program</i></strong><br /> This job creation stimulus package is another program designed to provide start-ups and small businesses with access to seed funding. As a joint venture between the Economic Development Authority and TD Bank, entrepreneurs may want to look into this financing program if they are interested in launching a business in the Red Bank area.</p><p><strong><i>Bottom line</i></strong><br /> Regardless of the type of financing, there are several options available. And time is of the essence. As Lewis Zlotnick, president of Woodmont Properties, explained recently in an interview with Real Estate Weekly, Red Bank is the next great location for development projects as his firm is developing the West Side Lofts in the Arts District.</p><p>""We've received a number of applications from residents who are interested in our West Side Lofts property that have come from New York City."" Zlotnick explained. ""In addition to the rising prices in Manhattan, there are various perks that are drawing more and more people to New Jersey. At West Side Lofts, we find that walkability and convenience are equally as important as affordability. Our residents have access to nightlife, restaurants, the beach, theaters and entertainment at their door step at half the price it would cost to live in Manhattan but they also appreciate the convenience of a short walk to the train to NYC.""</p>",,20160418,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/financing-your-business-in-red-bank/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/business-ins-red-bank.jpg,business-in-red-bank,,,business-in-red-bank,,"Firm Insights>Business Law","business law|New Jersey|new jersey business|Scarinci Hollenbeck",publish,11,financing-your-business-in-red-bank,,,0,0,closed,open

<p> <strong>Lyndhurst, New Jersey</strong> – April 21, 2016 - Congratulations to Scarinci Hollenbeck Partner Donald M. Pepe, who, in the span of one week, succeeded in obtaining several significant real estate approvals, one of which will allow for the construction of a Wawa convenience store and gas station on a formerly blighted site in North Bergen, New Jersey. Pepe also obtained four separate projects approved by two boards with a total of over 1,400 residential units in burgeoning Jersey City. </p>
[caption id=""attachment_7189"" align=""alignright"" width=""231""]<a href=""/attorneys/donald-m-pepe/""><img class=""wp-image-7189"" style=""margin-top: -20px; margin-left: 10px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pepe.jpg"" alt=""Donald M.

Don Pepe also works closely with the firm's cyber security and data protection law practice."" width=""231"" height=""253"" /></a> Donald M. Pepe, Esq.[/caption]
<p>Despite opposition from several neighbors, Pepe prevailed on the North Bergen Wawa application with a unanimous vote from the planning board. “The construction of the new Wawa will result in the clean-up of a site that has been environmentally contaminated for a long time,” Pepe explained. “We are proud to be part of Wawa’s North Jersey expansion,” he added. “Wawa is a store which offers high-quality products and is well known in South Jersey, and bringing additional locations to North Jersey will improve the neighborhoods in which they are constructed.”</p>
<p>In addition to his North Bergen win, Pepe obtained unanimous approval from the Jersey City Planning Board concerning two significant Jersey City redevelopment projects and, despite substantial and well-organized opposition from a neighborhood group chronicled in a number of articles in the Jersey Journal, approval for a third project from the Jersey City Zoning Board of Adjustment.  </p>
<p>The first Jersey City project is a proposed mixed-use development owned by Coles Street Development Company. It involves the construction of 1,181 residential units, 89,900 square feet of retail and parking spaces and the creation of a sizeable public park in keeping with the City’s Jersey Avenue Park Redevelopment Plan.  Located at the Lackawanna section of the City, this project will result in an entirely new, mixed-use neighborhood in a formerly industrialized corridor.  </p>
<p>The second and third projects, which both f<a href=""http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/uploadedFiles/City_Government/Department_of_Housing,_Economic_Development_and_Commerce/JOURNAL%20SQUARE%202060%20RDP%20-%20Ord%2010-103.pdf"" target=""_blank"">all under the Journal Square 2060 Redevelopment Plan</a>, involve the construction of a new 14-story mixed use building with 128 dwelling units, ground floor retail and two floors of commercial space and an 8-story mixed use building with ground floor commercial and 69 housing units.  The former is significant as it is the first project in Jersey City to take advantage of a recent amendment to the Journal Square 2060 Redevelopment Plan that allows for the addition of up to two residential floors in exchange for including two floors of commercial or office space in the same building.  </p>
<p>The fourth project, <a href=""http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2016/04/board_oks_five_story_building_for_fifth_street_res.html#incart_email"" target=""_blank"">which involves plans for a 12-unit building at 375 Fifth Street, met with the most opposition. </a> After nearly two years of resistance from neighbors and neighborhood organizations and following nearly three hours of plan presentations and testimonies from neighbors voicing strong objections to the project, the city's zoning board unanimously approved the five-story building.</p>
<p>In an article published in the Jersey Journal, Pepe, who devotes his practice to all aspects of complex real estate development and real estate transactional work with an emphasis on retail and residential development, explained that it has been a ""long journey with a lot of twists and turns.""</p>
<p>""It's very hard to find a consensus that makes everyone happy; we struggled to do that,"" Pepe said. ""We actually left more of a setback than the law would require, and we're very grateful for the board for seeing our efforts and rewarding them with the approval.""</p>

Covered entities that use the Internet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or services must be prepared to offer those communications through accessible means as well.</em><em> </em></p><p>The federal courts, however, have reached differing conclusions regarding the extent to which the ADA applies to websites as well as the standards for determining compliance. To provide greater clarity, the DOJ is currently working on <a href=""http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201504&amp;RIN=1190-AA61"" target=""_blank"">proposed revisions to its regulations implementing the ADA</a>.

18373,"Cybersecurity: 5 Ways Businesses Can Protect Data","<h2>The Internet has become the lifeline of business. It is as crucial for communications and R&amp;D functions as it is for tracking transactions and data management.</h2><p>This is particularly true now that more and more devices are able to access a company's network, which has pushed Cybersecurity to the forefront of priorities for a business. In fact, according to IBM Corp. Chairman, President and CEO Ginni Rometty at the IBM Security Summit last year, the problem is even bigger than many companies think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignright wp-image-18378 "" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/protect-data.jpg"" alt=""protect data"" width=""401"" height=""187"" /></p><p>""We believe that data is the phenomenon of our time,"" Rometti argued. ""It is the world's new natural resource. It is the new basis of competitive advantage, and it is transforming every profession and industry. If all of this is true - even inevitable - then cybercrime, by definition, is the greatest threat to every profession, every industry, every company in the world.""</p><h2>Cybercrime: The impact it can have on your business</h2><p>Last year, Lloyd's, the British insurance giant, released a report cited by Cyber Insurance magazine that cyberattacks cost businesses up to $400 billion per year. According to Forbes contributor Steve Morgan, many <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2016/01/17/cyber-crime-costs-projected-to-reach-2-trillion-by-2019/#277c3f6e3bb0"" target=""_blank"">media outlets project that number to hit as high as $500 billion annually</a>.</p><p>A Juniper report supported these findings by illustrating that cyber crimes quadrupled from 2013 to 2015. This is a trend that is expected to continue because by 2019 there will be four times as many cyberattacks expected to hit companies globally. As a result of rapid digitization of enterprise records and consumer data, Juniper research projects more than $2 trillion worth of damage to businesses worldwide.</p><p>What is clear is that as technology continues to evolve and be adopted by the business world, the potential cost of cyber crimes will grow with it. To prevent and mitigate the damage caused by cyberattacks, the State of New Jersey and the federal government have passed legislation to come down harder on cyber crimes.</p><p>However, that is only half the battle businesses face in preventing theft of data and online IDs, unlawful access and data harvesting, illegal account entry and hijacking, fraud, cyberterrorism, illegal downloading and file sharing, email account intrusions and various cyber crimes. All affected parties - to include consumers, financial institutions, regulators and the government - need to prioritize cybersecurity in order to create a safer environment.</p><p>That's why listed below are some ways that small and mid-size businesses can ramp up their cybersecurity efforts.</p><h2>Becoming familiar with evolving cybersecurity risks</h2><p>Cybersecurity preparedness starts with collective accountability. This involves understanding the vulnerabilities - internal and external - that may adversely affect a business. It also means that <a href=""http://www.mydigitalshield.com/5-ways-hackers-gain-access-data/"" target=""_blank"">businesses need to know how hackers can potentially gain entry into their systems</a> and what types of threats they face. That can include everything from phishing, spoofing, social engineering, malware, systems hacking, pharming and an endless number of other threats. Most importantly, though, it is crucial that businesses keep their technology, software and antivirus security applications up to date.</p><h2>Cybersecurity policies that are a significant part of company culture</h2><p>Defining and implementing cybersecurity protocols is one thing, but employees must adhere to the policies. Furthermore, every process and decision needs to be affected by these policies so that it is as much of a priority as business development, R&amp;D and customer service. These cybersecurity policies are a value-add for small to mid-size businesses because it is a selling point of their strategies and operations.</p><p>As such, it is necessary for employers to provide everything from education on safe practices and responses, to using unique passwords and encryption codes to protect their proprietary data.</p><h2>Use phone contact to verify transaction information</h2><p>Any type of transaction should be completed and verified over the phone, according to Forbes contributor Frank Sorrentino. The verification of financial requests is necessary to confirm exact details involved in a customer, vendor employee or bank transaction. This process simply adds a layer of protection onto data governance practices.</p><h2>Implement incident response plans with periodic practicing and testing</h2><p>These plans should be treated as emergency response plans like a fire drill. Response is as important as detection with cybersecurity protocols. All employees need to be well-versed in executing these plans down to the most minute details after a cyberbreach.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p><a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">As cyber crimes continue to evolve, protection and preparedness are paramount.</a> Businesses, especially smaller companies, need to ensure that their cybersecurity protocols will improve their abilities to combat mounting threats.</p>",,20160505,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/litigation/cyber-security/5-ways-businesses-can-protect-data/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/protect-data.jpg,"protect data",,"The Internet has become the lifeline of business.

18395,"A Better Way to Sell Your Business: Part 1","<h2>A better way to sell your business: how to buy a company with no money down</h2>
<p>The story is familiar - a business owner is getting older. He would like to sell the business to which he has devoted so much of his life and retire to a sunny climate while he can still enjoy it.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignright wp-image-18396 "" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business.jpg"" alt=""sell your business 1"" width=""402"" height=""188"" /></p>
<p>Although the business is profitable, running it requires a great deal of experience and hands-on attention. He has had offers from time to time, but the bids have been too low to warrant consideration. One way for a buyer to offer a price more acceptable to the owner is a variation on the leveraged buyout that was once so popular for bigger businesses. In this first part of a two part discussion, the purchase proposal is viewed from the needs and point of view of the buyer. The upcoming second part of the discussion, A Better Way to Sell Your Business, focuses on the seller’s needs and perspective.</p>
<h2>Common practice</h2>
<p>In a typical situation, the buyer (often one or more or key employees or a younger relative) has little or no money of his own to put into the business. What the buyer does have is the ability and determination to learn to manage the business as quickly as possible and to keep the enterprise profitable and growing. Typically, where the buyers are current minority owners or key employees, the learning curve will be dramatically shorter.</p>
<p>The seller and the buyer both seek an arrangement in which:</p>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li>The business eventually gets transferred to the new generation of leaders;</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li>The seller is fairly compensated for the business that he or she has nurtured since its inception; and</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li>The buyer is able to keep the business running profitably in order to generate sufficient profits to pay the founding seller and build additional capital for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Make Ownership Transition Work for All Concerned</h2>
<p><img class=""wp-image-18423 aligncenter"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business-4.jpg"" alt=""sell your business 4"" width=""400"" height=""187"" />With the cooperation of the owner and proposed buyer, a full set of financials for the business is prepared. The financial statements for the business should include a current balance sheet, sales and earnings statements for <em>at least</em> the last two years, revenue and cost projections, and a detailed list of “bankable” assets (including inventory, receivables, real estate and similar hard assets). Work in process should be included as part of the package.</p>
<p>The purchaser and seller work out an agreement, subject only to the receipt of financing, in which the buyer will acquire the business, using a portion of the profits of the business to pay the purchase price and, where a down payment is required, bank financing is used to make a down payment to the extent of which the buyer lacks personal finances and family resources are insufficient. If necessary, the seller is a guarantor for all or part of the bank loan or other outside financing source.</p>
<h2>The transition</h2>
<p>To ensure the business continues to be successful, so that there will be enough future profits to pay off the full selling price, the original owner agrees to stay with the business long enough to fully train the new management and pass on existing customers to the new owners. Founders are generally not motivated to cut corners. It works to their benefit to assist the new owners, if for no other reason than financial self-interest. New management benefits from the reputation, professional good will and experience of the original owner.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""wp-image-18421 alignleft"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business-3.jpg"" alt=""sell your business 3"" width=""402"" height=""188"" /></p>
<p>If the buyer is not able to fully convince the seller that the buyer will be able to pay the full purchase price over time, the parties may agree to test whether this type of transaction will work. The seller may give his new “partners” a contract that calls first for a trial or transitional period to develop the new relationship. That way, if the arrangement does not work out, the contract allows the owner to rescind the agreement, but can allow for some payment to the buyer for the time and expense, using a short term buyout “call” that the seller can be given on the equity being purchased by the buyer: a six month option to pay the buyer back and opt out, for example. If the arrangement does work out, the opt-out period expires, and the buyer is secure in the knowledge that the transaction has fully closed. The equity transition can also be structured in several different ways, so as to consider tax and other considerations of the seller, further discussed in <a href=""/better-way-sell-business-part-2"">Part 2 of this article</a>.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this sharing of responsibility is that the best people can be attracted to stay with the business, they're motivated to remain with the business, and the newly enfranchised management talent has added incentive to take a more proprietary and aggressive role in the growth of the business.</p>
<h2>Another Way</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is also now the new possibility of funding the transfer through crowdfunding.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A variation on the above arrangement is where all or a substantial part of the initial funds for the purchase come from the new owners or through third parties, other than a bank. A candidate owner may be able to avoid bank financing by raising some or all of the initial purchase payment from other qualified investors in return for both interest on the loan and an equity “kicker.” Generally, the funds are provided by business partners, family members or friends. Securing the funds could also be arranged through brokers, who usually charge between 5 and 10 percent commissions. There is also now the new possibility of funding the transfer through crowdfunding. In any event, the buyer will still need to gather the detailed information, financial statements and business description and projections that any experienced investor or lender would require.</p>
<p>However such arrangements must always be highly sensitive to state blue sky laws and federal securities law.</p>
<h2>Traps to Avoid</h2>
<p>It is important that the key employment, stock purchase and option agreements be drafted carefully and not contain errors or loopholes. In order to avoid or anticipate possible disagreements that could develop between the parties, the legal documents should be drafted by experienced counsel with input, where needed, from experienced accountants.</p>

Here, we will further consider the transaction, but from the perspective of the seller who is looking to retire from the business, yet wishes to maximize the sales price and is willing to accept a down payment secured from a third party other than the buyer and a secured payout over time.</p><h2>What happens next</h2><p>The seller may give the buyer, his new “partner,” a contract that calls first for a trial or transitional period to develop the new relationship. That way, if the arrangement does not work out, the contract allows the owner to rescind the agreement. If it does work out, the arrangement then can provide for the company to issue equity participation, <em>i.e.,</em> a partnership interest or shares via direct sale or an option agreement, vesting and exercisable over a period of time. Thus, the <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">equity ownership of the business can be structured</a> to pass either immediately on the closing, if the seller feels secure about receiving the full payment for the business, or the equity could remain subject to being collateral for the payment of the full purchase price.</p><p>Alternatively, if the seller was not sure about the buyer’s ability to fulfill the payment obligations over time, the closing could provide for transfer of only partial equity, subject to forfeiture on non-payment of any portion of the purchase price. Another variation would have the equity in the business be made subject to an earn-in by performance of the business over time. The measurements for the earn-in could be set by establishing performance milestones such as maintaining 85% of revenues or profits, growing the business annually or simply by the buyer successfully making annual payments.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-18428"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business-5.jpg"" alt=""sell your business 5"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Structuring the transaction</h2><p>The seller may also structure the transaction so as to <a href=""/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"">realize tax and other benefits</a> through the use of a further alternative, options exercisable for equity on future payments, with the options to provide that they vest and are exercisable only if the prospective owners remain on the job and with the business performing in accordance with expectations. If the buyer left, or if the seller became unhappy with the arrangement, for good cause, the seller would have the right to buy back the options or stock already transferred to the buyer at a prearranged price. From the seller’s point of view, this arrangement is desirable. He can time the payments for himself to fit his needs – <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">for both tax and spending considerations</a>; and, he is protected against a buyer’s failure to perform in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>The payments can be structured to be a mix of ordinary income, short term and long term capital gains, thus having the tax advantages of a regular installment sale. There are even ways to structure such an agreement so that payments can go into a trust, a retirement plan or an estate - oriented vehicle. These tax-advantaged structures require the input of sophisticated professional advisers who can provide projected results from which the seller can select the path most suited to his post-sale plans and needs.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><blockquote><p><em>The format described has proven to be a way for owners to retire and realize the greatest value for their efforts.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, the only way the owner of a business can retire without liquidating it is to find others to continue the business, and to arrange a secured time payout through outside financing sources, such as a bank or investment fund. The format described above has proven to be a way for owners to retire and realize the greatest value for their efforts.</p><p>Moreover, for the seller not yet ready to fully retire, he can realize the fruits of his labors even before retirement by selling the business to a person with whom he already has experience and familiarity, and use this type of sale transaction to immediately lessen his involvement in administrative matters. This would allow the seller, if he so desired, to return to a more active role in aspects of the business that he once enjoyed, such as sales development, research and development of new or improved products, or just plain socializing on the golf course with prospective customers.</p><p>To refer to Part 1 of our <em>A</em> <em>Better Way to Sell Your Business</em> piece, <a href=""/a-better-way-to-sell-your-business-part-1"">click here</a>.</p>",,20160510,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/better-way-sell-business-part-2/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sell-your-business-5.jpg,"sell your business 2|sell your business 5",,"In Part 1 of this two part article, we looked at a transaction in which a seller of a going business was retiring, and a young relative or key employee, who lacked sufficient initial funding for a down payment, was a proposed buyer.|Alternatively, if the seller was not sure about the buyer’s ability to fulfill the payment obligations over time, the closing could provide for transfer of only partial equity, subject to forfeiture on non-payment of any portion of the purchase price.

18438,"What Employee Benefits Must New Jersey Businesses Provide?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What Employee Benefits Must New Jersey Businesses Provide?</h2>
<p>As most entrepreneurs quickly learn, launching a new business can be both an exciting and daunting adventure. Many new business owners are overwhelmed by the numerous legal obligations that come with running a business, particularly when it comes to employment laws. One of the most common areas of concern is employee wages and benefits.</p>
<h2>Employee Wages</h2>
<p>Federal and state laws establish the minimum wage every worker is entitled to receive. They also identify which workers are entitled to receive overtime pay for working longer hours. Those who must be paid overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek are referred to as being “non-exempt.” The U.S. Department of Labor has advised that workers are presumed to be employees and entitled to minimum wage and overtime. There are limited exceptions where overtime is not required (the “white collar” exemptions, for example), but the rules for exemptions must be studied carefully and properly applied.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""wp-image-18441 aligncenter"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Employee-Benefits.jpg"" alt=""Employee Benefits"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p>
<p>At the federal level, the <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)</a> prescribes the standards for wages and overtime pay that affect most private employers. Employers need to comply with federal AND state wage laws, it is imperative that new businesses also receive guidance on the requirements under their state law. For instance, New York employers must be aware of recent changes to the state’s minimum wage. Further, there is no such thing as an exemption for being “salaried” without meeting the “duties tests” that must be satisfied for the exemption.</p>
<p>Employers must establish the seven day “work week” during which all time worked must be measured and recorded and set the “rate of pay” for the first 40 hours and the “time and one-half” overtime rate. If an employer does not keep proper time and pay records, the law will credit whatever the employee claims.</p>
<h2>Employee wage law mistakes to avoid</h2>
<p>Common wage law mistakes that can lead to liability include:</p>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li>Failing to pay the correct minimum wage</li>
	<li>Not compensating for overtime hours and/or requiring employees work ""off-the-clock"" without compensation</li>
	<li>Misclassifying employees as exempt salaried employees or independent contractors</li>
	<li>Miscalculating tip deductions</li>
	<li>Failing to properly record hours worked</li>
	<li>Incorrectly paying supplemental time (break time, travel time, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employee Benefits</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>While the decision to offer benefits is voluntary, employers should note that many of these benefits are subject to state and federal laws.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than worker’s compensation, unemployment compensation and disability under New Jersey law, the law does not generally require an employer to offer fringe benefits. Federal law mandates some employee benefits such as leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (New Jersey has a paid Family Leave benefit). Otherwise, it is the employer that determines whether to offer most other benefits, such as health insurance, dental insurance, retirement plans, etc. Paid time off such as holiday and vacation are also employee benefits determined by the employer.</p>
<p>While the decision to offer benefits is voluntary, employers should note that many of these benefits are subject to state and federal laws. For instance, <a href=""/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-law/"">the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires employers</a> to provide plan participants with written notification of the most important facts they need to know about their retirement and health benefit plans including plan rules, financial information, and documents on the operation and management of the plan.</p>
<h2>Tip for Employers</h2>
<p>Mistakes made with respect to wages and benefit plans can lead to costly lawsuits. Therefore, it is important to <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">consult with an experienced employment law attorney</a> to ensure your new business is in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>",,20160516,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/what-employee-benefits-must-new-jersey-businesses-provide/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Employee-Benefits.jpg,"Employee Benefits",,"As most entrepreneurs quickly learn, launching a new business can be both an exciting and daunting adventure.

Most notably, the report confirms that the FTC is increasingly concerned about how emerging technologies are impacting consumers, as well as <a href=""/practices/mergers-and-acquisitions/"">how business mergers are impacting competition</a>.</p><p>“2015 was another busy year for the FTC fighting fraud and deception, as well as promoting competition and consumer choice,” Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a press statement. “In our law enforcement and policy work, we placed special emphasis on sectors of the economy that have the biggest impact on consumers, such as health care and the digital economy.”</p><h2>FTC Enforcement Highlights</h2><p>In total, the FTC imposed $21.8 million in civil penalties in 2015. While the agency was active in a variety of industries, the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries saw the most enforcement actions. As evidence of its efforts to prevent anticompetitive healthcare provider consolidation, <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/12/ftc-challenges-proposed-merger-two-chicago-area-hospital-systems"" target=""_blank"">the FTC filed suit to block three proposed hospital mergers in 2015</a>.</p><p>Overall, the FTC filed 27 merger challenges in 2015, along with a number of anticompetitive conduct cases. The agency specifically noted that <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2015/06/23/amit-mehta-ftc-block-sysco-us-foods-merger-antitrust/#2eb98e497ee4"" target=""_blank"">it successfully prevented Sysco from buying its rival, US Foods</a>, thereby preserving competition in the $231 billion foodservice industry.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-18455"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/annual-highlights-report-2.jpg"" alt=""annual highlights report"" width=""400"" height=""187"" />In the area of consumer protection, the Annual Highlights report also emphasized that the FTC had many victories in 2015 at both the district court and appellate levels on key issues of concern, including the common carrier exemption (AT&amp;T Mobility), data security (Wyndham), and deceptive advertising (POM Wonderful). As we discussed on this blog, in <em>FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corporation</em>, the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/ftc-cybersecurity-authority-is-affirmed/"" target=""_blank"">Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the FTC’s cybersecurity authority</a> to hold businesses liable for data breaches under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p><p>Finally, the FTC also had a record year of debt collection enforcement.

Most notably, in <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy/amicus-briefs/2015/06/american-sales-co-et-al-plaintiffs-appellants-v-warner"" target=""_blank""><em>American Sales v. Warner-Chilcott</em></a>, the FTC argued that reverse-payment patent litigation settlements, also referred to as “pay-for-delay” settlements, can still violate antitrust laws even when <em>non-cash</em> payments are made.</p><p>The majority of the FTC staff’s advocacy comments also focused on the healthcare industry. The agency issued comments to legislators in four states, including New York, that raised concerns over efforts to provide antitrust immunity for mergers and other collaborations among health care providers. The FTC also noted that its staff conducted several workshops focused on new and rapidly changing markets or technologies, such as the sharing economy, cross-device tracking, and new developments in healthcare provider organization and payment models.</p><h2>FTC Outreach Highlights</h2><blockquote><p><em>Whenever the FTC issues new guidance, enforcement actions are likely to follow.</em></p></blockquote><p>With regard to education, the FTC report highlights its work to alert businesses to the agency’s compliance standards. For those who don’t already follow the agency’s business blog, it is a great way to keep up with data regarding FTC guidance and enforcement initiatives.</p><p>In 2015, the FTC launched its multimedia Start with Security initiative, revised its FAQs about the endorsement guides, and issued a <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections-building-security-internet-things"" target=""_blank"">new brochure for companies entering the Internet of Things marketplace.</a> In December of 2015, the agency issued guidance on “native advertising,” reminding businesses that an advertisement or promotional message shouldn’t suggest or imply to consumers that it’s anything other than an advertisement, particularly on social media.</p><p><img class=""alignleft  wp-image-18458"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/annual-highlights-report.jpg"" alt=""annual highlights report 3"" width=""400"" height=""187"" />Whenever the FTC issues new guidance, enforcement actions are likely to follow.

18461,"Resurgence of Mergers and Acquisitions in New Jersey","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Mergers and Acquisitions Expected to Grow in New Jersey<strong> </strong></h2>
<p>As economic confidence grows, merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity is expected to grow in Monmouth County and throughout New Jersey. Nonetheless, joining two companies is not an easy task. Mergers and acquisitions are among the most complex corporate transactions.</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18465"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mergers-Acquisitions-Expected-to-Grow-in-New-Jersey-.jpg"" alt=""Mergers &amp; Acquisitions"" width=""504"" height=""235"" /></p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of negotiating the terms of an agreement, including the determination of the most tax-efficient structure for the transaction, M&amp;A transactions are also subject to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Mergers and acquisitions involve unique business activities</h3>
<p>To help navigate these sophisticated transactions, New Jersey companies should <a href=""/practices/mergers-and-acquisitions/"">seek the assistance of business lawyers experienced in mergers and acquisitions</a>. They can often structure a deal to minimize regulatory scrutiny while still meeting the needs of the parties.</p>
<p>While M&amp;A are often lumped together, they involve distinct business activities. In a merger, two companies join to form a single company. Although there are many possible combinations, the most common types include the following:</p>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li><strong>Vertical: </strong>Two companies from different levels of the supply chain combine to improve efficiency and cut costs. Examples include America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc.</li>
	<li><strong>Horizontal: </strong>Direct competitors that operate in the same industry and often offer the same goods and services merge to obtain a larger market share. Examples include Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.</li>
	<li><strong>Conglomerate: </strong>Companies with no common business activities unite to spread the reach of the newly formed entity. Examples include Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Gillette Co.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote style=""margin-left: 220px;margin-right: 218px;"">
<p style=""text-align: center;"">While M&amp;A are often lumped together, they involve distinct business activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an acquisition, one company acquires the assets or stock (or other equity interests) of another company. In a transaction involving the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a target company, the target company thereafter will cease to exist as an operating company and will often be dissolved and liquidated.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary acquisitions</h3>
<p>In a transaction involving the acquisition of the outstanding stock or other equity interests of the target company from its equity owners, the target company will become a subsidiary of the acquiring company. These acquisitions largely fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;"">
	<li><strong>Friendly: </strong>The management and board of directors of the target company approve the terms of the buyout, which may involve the payment of stock and/or cash. While management may sign off, the target company’s shareholders and regulators must also generally approve the deal.</li>
	<li><strong>Hostile: </strong>The target company’s management resists the acquisition. To effect the transaction, the acquirer must directly gain the approval of the shareholders or replace the existing board of directors. These battles can be protracted and costly for both sides.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mergers and acquisitions face regulatory hurdles</h3>
<p>Because M&amp;A can directly impact competition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and <a href=""/businesses-can-learn-ftcs-2015-annual-highlights-report"">the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regularly review proposed or consummated transactions.</a> The agencies can prohibit anticompetitive transactions under a number of antitrust laws, including the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Anti-Trust Act.</p>
<p>Because horizontal M&amp;A involve direct competitors, they often receive the most intense scrutiny. In <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/merger-enforcement.html"" target=""_blank"">accordance with their Horizontal Merger Guidelines</a>, the DOJ and FTC will specifically look for evidence of anticompetitive effects, including post-acquisition price increases, market share concentration or other changes adverse to customers.</p>",,20160525,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/mergers-acquisitions-expected-to-grow-in-new-jersey/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mergers-Acquisitions-Expected-to-Grow-in-New-Jersey-.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mergers-and-acquisitions-2.jpg,"Mergers & Acquisitions Expected to Grow in New Jersey|mergers and acquisitions 2",,"As economic confidence grows, merger and acquisition (M&A) activity is expected to grow in Monmouth County and throughout New Jersey.

In its annual report, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently flagged several U.S. trading partners that are failing to adequately protect or even acknowledge IP rights of owners.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignright  wp-image-18512"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IP-Protection-2.jpg"" alt=""IP Protection 2"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><p>According to the report, intellectual property right (IPR) protection, enforcement, and market access for persons relying on IPR is declining in several countries. The “Priority Watch List” includes Algeria, Argentina, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Russia. Thailand, Ukraine, and Venezuela.</p><h2>Who was Reviewed?</h2><p>In total, the <a href=""https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/USTR-2016-Special-301-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Trade Office reviewed 72 trading partners in its 2016 Special 301 Report</a>. The lower-level watch list includes 23 countries: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Romania, Switzerland, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.</p><p>China and India are frequently on the USTR’s watch list, with China earning a spot in each of the 27 years the report has been issued. While the Section 301 Report notes that China has implemented a series of IP reforms, it also states:</p><p><em>[P]rogress toward effective protection and enforcement of IPR in China is undermined by unchecked trade secret theft, market access obstacles to ICT [information and communications technology] products raised in the name of security, measures favoring domestically owned intellectual property in the name of promoting innovation in China, rampant piracy and counterfeiting in China’s massive online and physical markets, extensive use of unlicensed software, and the supply of counterfeit goods to foreign markets. </em></p><h2>More from Section 301</h2><p>The Section 301 Report also acknowledges that India has worked to strengthen its IP laws. However, it also raised a number of new concerns, including India’s proposed Patent Rule Amendments. According to the USTR, the proposed patent law changes would “introduce concerning new incentives to pressure patent applicants to localize manufacturing in India and require the submission of sensitive business information to India’s Patent Office.”</p><p><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-18513"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IP-Protection.jpg"" alt=""IP Protection"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><p>The Section 301 Report also highlights several other issues of particular concern to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. They include:</p><ul style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: circle;""><li>irregularities in the application of Section 3(d) of India’s Patents Act;</li><li>the lack of an effective system for protecting against unfair commercial use, as well as the unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products;</li><li>the lack of an effective system for notifying interested parties of marketing approvals for generic pharmaceuticals in a manner that would allow for the early resolution of potential patent disputes.</li></ul><p>Finally, the most surprising addition to the IP watch list is Switzerland. According to the report, the country earned a spot of the list due to U.S. concerns regarding Switzerland’s <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">system of online copyright protection and enforcement</a>.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><blockquote><p><em>...businesses and owners of creative works must take a number of factors into consideration prior to entering a new market, including intellectual property protection.</em></p></blockquote><p>As mentioned in the report, a 2010 ruling by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court prohibited an anti-piracy company from tracking copyright trolls and effectively deprived copyright holders in Switzerland of the means to enforce their rights against online infringers. Since the decision, Switzerland has become an increasingly popular host country for infringing websites.</p><p>As the report highlights, New Jersey businesses and owners of creative works must take a number of factors into consideration prior to entering a new market, <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">including intellectual property protection</a>. While the global economy provides a number of new opportunities for small businesses, future success can be impacted by the ability to secure international protection of their patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.</p><p>Do you have questions about this topic or would like to <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">discuss your intellectual property or entertainment needs</a>?

Rather, it reflects a growing trend for pop stars, entertainers, and musicians to seek to trademark lyrics as ""merchandise catch phrases.” Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville Enterprises, LLC has more than 700 pending trademark applications and registrations. The estates of Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley have also obtained trademark registrations for song lyrics and titles.</p><h2>Trademark v. Copyrights</h2><p>While <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property-technology/"">both are intended to safeguard intellectual property</a>, trademarks and copyrights offer distinct legal protections. Song lyrics are typically protected via copyright registration. Under federal law, works of authorship that have been tangibly expressed in a physical form, such as songs, books, movies, and works of art, are subject to copyright protection. Once a copyright is registered, the holder can control how the work is reproduced, distributed and presented publicly, as well as sue infringers in federal court.</p><p>In contrast, a trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design or product configuration that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. Common examples include brand names, slogans, and logos. Federal registration in some circumstances creates a legal presumption of ownership nationwide, and provides the exclusive right to use the mark on, or in connection with, the goods or services listed in the registration.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-18541"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trademark-and-Copyright-Protection-2.jpg"" alt=""Trademark and Copyright Protection 2"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><h2>Blurring the Lines</h2><p><a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment/"">Trademark law is intended to protect consumers</a> from being deceived and purchasing inferior goods, or from being confused as to the source of those goods. However, musicians are increasingly using it as a sword to prevent other businesses from exploiting the song lyrics and phrases. Even if artists like Swift never actually use the marks in commerce, they can still attempt to exclude others from commercializing their lyrics while the application is pending.</p><p>This practice is thus fraught with hazards when a trademark is sought to usurp copyright. Common phrases in songs now will be fought over, and usages both in copyright and trademark will be blurred.</p><p>Do you have questions about this topic or would like to <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">discuss your intellectual property or entertainment needs</a>?

According to the White House, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/17/email-president-obama-ive-got-news-you-overtime"" target=""_blank"">the updated overtime rule will extend overtime protections to 4.2 million white-collar workers</a> within the first year of its implementation. Accordingly, it will also have a tremendous impact on employers.</p><p>It is recommended that a top-to-bottom wage review be conducted to determine what changes to current wage practices and structures may be necessary to accommodate these new requirements. The fact that a worker goes from being classified “exempt” to “non-exempt” does not mean, necessarily, that such employee will receive more pay. What will change is the need to establish a “rate of pay” and overtime rate while also keeping careful and accurate track of all hours worked in a work week. Newly non-exempt employees must be paid overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 40.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18677"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/overtime-regulations-2.jpg"" alt=""overtime regulations"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><p>In some instances, an employer may choose to raise an exempt worker’s annual compensation to maintain such exemption if the cost of such raise is affordable.</p><p>There is no “right way” to make these adjustments.

Broken into four panels, the event seeks to c<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2016/06/start-security-chicago"" target=""_blank"">over the general concerns of any business operating in the digital space. </a></p><h3>The first panel will discuss how cyber security issues have become so pervasive that they no longer exist in the realm of specialized departments speaking in strange jargon.</h3><p>Just like corporate culture adapted to the telephone and email, it must adapt to the constraints and concerns of cyber security so that every person working for the company generally understands how to work with security in mind as, more often than not, careless or uninformed employees cause security breaches.</p><p>Therefore, the most important concept and policy for any company is establishing a corporate mindset of cyber security. To that end, businesses need to be aware that cyber security has diverged so much from regular IT work that it truly does require another dedicated group to manage.</p><h3>The next panel is about cyber security integration in software development and deployment.</h3><p>It will cost more money upfront to integrate another complication into the development process, but it could save more money in the end. Much like builders would rather construct a building right the first time rather than retrofit it, companies should develop and deploy new software with robust cyber security built in.</p><p>As a corollary to the second panel, the third focuses on working with third parties. As anyone who has worked with HIPAA knows, this represents a serious problem. Third parties with system access (such as credit companies, software companies, contractors, etc.) can also be an Achilles’ heel to those systems. Even with the best cyber security parameters, if you grant access to a third party with inadequate cyber security, then your company will be exposed. Thus, companies should perform due diligence on any third party wanting system access.</p><h3>The last panel addresses the nuts and bolts of cyber security—network security.</h3><p>The real problem with cyber security is that the more secure one makes a network the less functionality and ease-of-use that network will possess. So, fundamentally, good cyber security practices are a balancing act between ease-of-use and protection. Finding that equilibrium is unique to each company and needs to be continually assessed to adapt to the rapidly advancing arms races between network attackers and defenders.</p><p>Ultimately, the best cyber security practice is having a corporate culture well informed of attacker’s methods and your system’s defenses.</p><p><strong>About the Authors:</strong></p><p><strong>Fernando M.

<p><strong>Lyndhurst, NJ – June 7, 2016</strong> – Ronald S. “Ron” Bienstock, Scarinci Hollenbeck partner and co-chair of both the firm’s Entertainment, Media and Sports Group, and its Intellectual Property Group, will lead two roundtable discussions at the summer conference of the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). The NAMM conference, held at Nashville’s Music City Center from June 23 through 25, showcases the biggest ideas and best practices for the retail music industry, covering hot topics, such as marketing, store design, websites, music lessons, customer experience, finance, and more. Bienstock will lead two roundtable discussions: Product Configuration Trademarks (on June 23), and Copyright, Artists and Music Publishing (on June 24).</p>
<p>At the Product Configuration Trademarks session, Bienstock will discuss the trademark process for protecting intellectual property, such as guitars. “Trademarks and product configurations are definitely a hot topic,” said Bienstock. “Guitar headstocks, body shapes, and generally the ‘shape of things’ in the music industry has changed so much in the past five years that it’s essential to stay on top of what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Bienstock gained prominence in this area after his unprecedented <a href=""/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ron-Bienstock-Defeats-Fender-Musical-Instruments.pdf"" target=""_blank"">trademark opposition victory</a> against Fender Musical Instruments. In that matter, Bienstock represented 17 guitar manufacturers in a trademark opposition proceeding against Fender, successfully arguing that Fender should not be allowed trademark registrations for three guitar and bass body shapes.</p>
<p>At the roundtable discussion for Copyright, Artists and Music Publishing, participants will learn the basics of the music publishing industry. Bienstock will lead a discussion on pressing copyright issues, including licensing and royalty agreements, facing musicians today. As Bienstock explained, “Copyright, artists, and music publishing have always been hot topics, and this has evolved even further with so many artists putting out their own products across the country. So many NAMM members are musicians themselves, along with their customers, and they really crave the right information.”</p>

The federal statute requires consumer reporting agencies to “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of” consumer reports, and imposes liability on “[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement [of the Act] with respect to any” individual.</p><h3>What is Spokeo?</h3><p>Spokeo operates a “people search engine,” which searches numerous databases to gather and provide personal information about individuals to a variety of users, including employers seeking to evaluate prospective employees. After Robins discovered that his Spokeo-generated profile contained inaccurate information, he <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">filed a federal class-action lawsuit</a> against Spokeo, alleging that the company willfully failed to comply with the FCRA’s requirements.</p><p>The District Court dismissed Robins’ complaint, holding that he had not properly pleaded injury in fact as required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Based on Robins’ allegation that “Spokeo violated <em>his </em>statutory rights” and the fact that Robins’ “personal interests in the handling of his credit information are <em>individualized</em>,” the court held that Robins had adequately alleged an injury in fact.</p><p>The question presented before the Supreme Court was whether <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/the-united-states-constitution/#TCArticleIII"" target=""_blank"">Congress may confer Article III</a> standing upon a plaintiff who suffers no concrete harm, and who therefore could not otherwise invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, by authorizing a private right of action based on a bare violation of a federal statute.</p><h3>The Court’s Decision</h3><p><img class=""alignleft wp-image-18793"" style=""margin-top: -10px;"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spokeo-3.jpg"" alt=""the spokeo decision"" width=""400"" height=""187"" />By a vote of 6-2, the <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/13-1339_f2q3.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Court ordered the Ninth Circuit to examine the standing question again</a>. “Because the Ninth Circuit failed to consider both aspects of the injury-in-fact requirement, its Article III standing analysis was incomplete,” the Court held.</p><p>Under existing Court precedent, the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing consists of three elements. The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. As Justice Samuel Alito further highlighted in the majority opinion, the plaintiff’s injury must be both “concrete and particularized.” </p><p>According to the Court, the Ninth Circuit “elided” the two requirements of the test. As Justice Alito explained, concreteness is quite different from particularization. However, he was also quick to point out that “concrete” is not necessarily synonymous with tangible. While the Court stated that Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, it also noted:</p><p><em>Congress’ role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right. Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation. </em></p><h3>The take-away</h3><p>Nonetheless, the majority did acknowledge that the violation of a statutory right “can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact.” With regard to the case before the Court, Justice Alito wrote:</p><p><em>[T]hese general principles tell us two things: On the one hand, Congress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk. On the other hand, Robins cannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation. </em></p><p>Going forward, the Court provided some guidance to the Ninth Circuit. It noted that ""even if a consumer reporting agency fails to provide the required notice to a user of the agency's consumer information, that information regardless may be entirely accurate"" and accordingly would result in no concrete harm sufficient to create Article III standing. ""In addition,"" the Court added, ""not all inaccuracies cause harm or present any material risk of harm. An example that comes readily to mind is an incorrect zip code. It is difficult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm.""</p><h2> </h2><blockquote style=""margin: 0px 125px 20px 150px;""><p><em>The decision is also expected the impact data privacy lawsuits based on “technical” violations.</em></p></blockquote><h3>The Impact on NJ Businesses</h3><p>The<em> Spokeo</em> decision did not create the bright-line rule that many litigators would have liked. However, it should make it more difficult for plaintiffs to bring lawsuits where the only injury alleged is a statutory violation. For instance, the Supreme Court’s decision may also help Monmouth County businesses defend lawsuits under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/sending-unsolicited-facsimiles/"" target=""_blank"">TCPA is frequently the subject of class-action suits</a> because it authorizes statutory damages of $500-$1,500 per violation, regardless of the actual damages suffered by the recipient.</p><p>The decision is also expected the impact <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">data privacy lawsuits based on “technical” violations</a>. In fact, a Maryland district court judge specifically cited <em>Spokeo</em> in remanding a data breach class action to a Maryland state court for failure to meet federal standing requirements. “Although ‘Congress may ‘elevate to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law,’ a ‘bare procedural harm’ under a federal statute, ‘divorced from any concrete harm,’ would not ‘satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement,'” the judge wrote.</p>",,20160610,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/litigation/spokeo-decision-affect-nj-businesses/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spokeo-3.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spokeo-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spokeo-1.jpg,"spokeo 3|spokeo 2|spokeo 1",,"By a vote of 6-2, the Court ordered the Ninth Circuit to examine the standing question again. “Because the Ninth Circuit failed to consider both aspects of the injury-in-fact requirement, its Article III standing analysis was incomplete,” the Court held.|The U.S. Supreme Court recently sent Spokeo v.

18803,"Stairway to Heaven Lawsuit Breakdown","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Intellectual Property Attorney Brent “Giles” Davis Breaks Down What the Jury Will have to Consider in the Stairway to Heaven Lawsuit.</h2>
<p> The upcoming copyright infringement trial involving Led Zeppelin’s hit, <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>, has recently received a great deal of media attention. In the case<em><strong> <u>Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin</u>,</strong> </em>plaintiff, the estate of Randy Wolfe, guitarist and songwriter for the band Spirit, alleges that Led Zeppelin front men Jimmy Page and Robert Plant copied the Spirit song <em>Taurus </em>when they wrote <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>. The jury trial for the Stairway to Heaven lawsuit is set to begin in the Central District of California later this month.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1O97tIBFY</p>
<h3>What the Plaintiff Needs to Prove</h3>
<p>To prevail on the copyright infringement claim in the Skidmore case, the Estate of Randy Wolfe must prove two things: (1) that Wolfe owned a valid copyright in <em>Taurus</em>; and (2) that Page and Plant copied “protected elements” of <em>Taurus.</em></p>
<h3>Ownership of Valid Copyright</h3>
<p>Ownership is not typically a contested issue in copyright infringement cases. In the Skidmore case, however, it is an issue that could put this dispute to rest, since Wolfe possibly created <em>Taurus</em> as what is known as a “work for hire.”</p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-18845"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stairway-to-heaven-lawsuit.jpg"" alt=""Intellectual Property Attorney Brent “Giles” Davis Breaks Down What the Jury Will have to Consider in the Stairway to Heaven Lawsuit."" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p>
<p>Ordinarily, when a work is created, the ownership in the copyright vests with the author of the work. There is an exception, however, when the work is created as a “work for hire.” As <em>Taurus</em> was written before 1976, the 1909 Copyright Act will control on this issue. Under the 1909 copyright act, the Supreme Court has defined a ""work for hire"" as a work “made by employees in the regular course of their employment.” The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the controlling law of the case, evaluates a work for hire under the 1909 Act by asking whether it was created at the “instance and expense” of the engaging party.</p>
<p>“Work for hire” will be a key issue in the Skidmore case, because in 1967, Wolfe entered into an exclusive songwriter agreement with a publishing company, Hollenbeck Music. This agreement deemed Wolfe to be a “writer for hire” with “full rights of copyright renewal vested in Hollenbeck.” The jury will need to determine exactly when Wolfe wrote <em>Taurus</em>, a date that is currently in dispute by the parties. If the jury finds that <em>Taurus</em> was created <em>after</em> Wolfe entered the agreement, the case would end there, leaving Page and Plant victorious.</p>
<h3>Copying of Protected Elements</h3>
<p>If Wolfe establishes that he owns the copyright in <em>Taurus</em>, he then must prove that Page and Plant copied protectable elements of <em>Taurus</em>. A plaintiff can prove this in two ways: 1) by direct evidence of copying, or 2) the defendant had access to plaintiff's work when creating its own work, and that the two works are “substantially similar.” Alternatively, in the absence of any proof of access, a plaintiff can still make out a case of infringement by showing that the works were “strikingly similar.”</p>
<p>In this case, the Court has already ruled in favor of Plant and Page, deciding that no evidence of direct copying or striking similarity exists. As such, the jury will only be able to find infringement if they determine Plant and Page had access and the two songs are substantially similar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""...in the absence of any proof of access, a plaintiff can still make out a case of infringement by showing that the works were “strikingly similar.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another blow to Wolfe is the Court’s ruling that access cannot be presumed, because <em>Taurus</em> was not “widely disseminated.” Wolfe will need to prove that Page and Plant had actually heard <em>Taurus</em> before they wrote <em>Stairway</em>. To that end, the jury will hear testimony of Led Zeppelin and Spirit playing at the same festival, on the same day, on three separate occasions between 1968 and the release of <em>Stairway to Heaven</em> in 1971.</p>
<p>However, there is conflicting testimony concerning whether Spirit played <em>Taurus </em>at any of those shows, or whether Zeppelin even saw Spirit perform. If the jury concludes that Page and Plant never heard <em>Taurus</em>, Wolfe’s case will essentially be over. If the jury determines that Page and Plant <em>did</em> have access, Wolfe will then need to prove substantial similarity in order to prevail.</p>
<h3>Proving ""Substantial Similarity""</h3>
<p>Simply stated, “substantial similarity” means there is a strong resemblance between a copyrighted work and an allegedly infringing work. The standard for substantial similarity is whether an ordinary person would conclude that the alleged infringement has appropriated “nontrivial amounts” of the copyrighted work’s protectable elements.</p>
<p>The issue of substantial similarity is one to which social media has done a great disservice in this case. Although many people have come across comparisons of the <em>recordings</em> of two songs, it is the <em>compositions</em> as opposed to the sound recordings that are at issue in this case. As the Court noted in its ruling on the summary judgment motions, “[s]ound recordings and their underlying musical compositions are separate works with their own distinct copyrights.... Accordingly, the court must first determine what elements of Plaintiff's work are protected by his copyright in the musical composition, as opposed to those protected by the copyright in the sound recording, and 'filter out' the latter.”<em> </em></p>
<h3>What Elements can be Copyright Protected?</h3>
<p>Thus, Wolfe’s only valid copyright claim lies in the musical composition of <em>Taurus</em>, not the sound recording, since Congress did not extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings until the Sound Recording Act of 1971, and then only to sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. To make his case, Wolfe will need to rely on the sheet music for <em>Taurus</em> that was originally filed with the Copyright Office. Most importantly, the Court has ruled that the jury will not hear the recording of <em>Taurus</em>.</p>
<p>What is left for the jury to decide is if any elements of the sheet music are protectable, and whether or not <em>Stairway</em>, when viewed by an ordinary observer, is substantially similar to those protectable elements. In terms of music, elements like chord changes and harmony are not considered to be “protectable elements,” as they are so commonly used that giving them protection would rob other composers of building blocks to create new compositions. For example, a “blues” song typically follows a twelve-bar, three chord progression, known as a “I-IV-V.” If this chord progression was a protectable element, then there would only be one “blues” song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""In terms of music, elements like chord changes and harmony are not considered to be “protectable elements...""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jury will hear testimony that the descending chord changes in both <em>Taurus</em> and <em>Stairway</em> have been used in Western music for centuries, and that any similarity between the two are solely non-protectable elements. Wolfe will, of course, more than likely present an expert that will say the opposite. While it is tempting to go into a prolonged analysis, the reality is that this determination is extremely subjective, and it is “coin toss” as to what a jury will decide.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Wolfe can prove that: (1) he, and not his publishing company, owns a valid copyright in <em>Taurus</em>; and (2) that Page and Plant had actual access to <em>Taurus</em> when writing <em>Stairway</em>, and the two are substantially similar, then he will have proven copyright infringement. Does this mean that the estate will then be entitled to a substantial monetary award? Not yet; if Wolfe’s estate successfully prevails on these issues, there will still be additional hurdles to clear before the case is over.</p>
<h3>The Affirmative Defenses of Abandonment and Waiver</h3>
<p>An affirmative defense is a justification that, if proven, would eliminate liability even if the plaintiff proves all its allegations. In other words, the defendant is saying that “even if I did everything of which the plaintiff accuses me, I cannot be held liable because of this mitigating affirmative defense.” If an affirmative defense is asserted, the defendant is not admitting liability; he is allowed to offer the affirmative defense while still denying liability outright.</p>
<p>In the <em>Stairway</em> case, Page and Plant have asserted the affirmative defenses of abandonment and waiver. In copyright law, waiver or abandonment occurs only if there is an intent by the copyright owner to surrender rights in his work. Unlike the copyright infringement claim where Wolfe had the burden of proof, here the burden of proving the affirmative defenses falls on Page and Plant. That means that even if the jury decides that copyright infringement exists, if the jury finds that Page and Plant offer evidence proving that Wolfe intentionally surrendered his rights in <em>Taurus</em>, Page and Plant are will not be liable for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>During the trial, the jury will hear an audio recording on an interview in which Wolfe said “I'll let [Led Zeppelin] have the beginning of <em>Taurus</em> for their song without a lawsuit.” Wolfe will present evidence of the tenor of the interview, which indicates that he felt cheated by Led Zeppelin, and was merely trying to “save face” and make light of a bad situation. Several pieces of evidence seem to demonstrate that Wolfe acted in a manner inconsistent with an intent to abandon his rights. If, and only if, the jury determines that Wolfe did not abandon or waive his rights will Wolfe prevail on his claim and, at that point, the jury will award damages. Even then, however, the Court has made several rulings that could severely limit the amount of damages Wolfe would receive.</p>
<h3>Damages</h3>
<p>The Court has already ruled that if Wolfe owns any part of <em>Taurus</em>, it is only 50%. Therefore, if he prevails, Wolfe will only be entitled to half of any damages the jury awards. Further, in the summary judgment decision, the Court stated that it was “sympathetic” to Plant and Page regarding the four decade delay in Wolfe bringing the lawsuit. While the Court declined to completely bar any damages, it stated that Page and Plant can ask the Court to reduce the damages “in an amount commensurate with the delay, and the Court will consider the issue again at that time.” Finally, the Court has limited damages to those profits earned by <em>Stairway</em> only in the United States.</p>
<p>The Court has also ruled that the jury will not hear any evidence of other Zeppelin songs that were found to have infringed on other compositions, nor will it hear evidence of Zeppelin’s drug and alcohol use. Moreover, the Court has also excluded evidence of Page and Plant’s wealth, and has also limited the length of the trial, giving each side only ten hours to present their cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Even if it proves infringement and Page and Plant fail to prove their affirmative defenses, the Court’s rulings on damages could severely limit the recovery in court.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For all of these reasons, (pardon the pun), the Wolfe Estate has a very steep <em>stairway</em> to climb to prevail in this lawsuit. Even if it proves infringement and Page and Plant fail to prove their affirmative defenses, the Court’s rulings on damages could severely limit the recovery in court. However, it is important to note that that a small damages award would not be the only economic benefit the estate would receive if it prevails. Going forward, the Estate would be entitled to a share of the income earned by the composition of <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>, which, needless to say, is hardly insignificant. <em>Stairway </em>earns income through radio and television plays, sales of recordings of the song, use in films and by public performances. Despite a potentially small (in relative terms) monetary judgement, the true economic benefit could be reaped through the money <em>Stairway</em> is to earn going forward.</p>
<p>Despite what may have been seen on social media, this case is far more complicated than what has generally been presented as “the two recordings sound alike.” As discussed, the jury could determine that <em>Taurus</em> was created as a “work for hire” or that Wolfe intentionally surrendered his rights. In either of those scenarios, Page and Plant would prevail and any similarities between <em>Taurus</em> and <em>Stairway to Heaven</em> would not even be relevant to the verdict.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since these songs were written. The jury will not come from the land of the ice and snow, nor from the midnight sun where the hot springs blow, but from in and around Los Angeles area. What the jury will have to decide is not as hard, hard, hard as it seems. They will not be dazed and confused. They will listen to the evidence, make the determinations discussed above and render their verdict. But whichever way the verdict goes, it's just a spring clean for the May Queen.</p>

Businesses typically form corporations when transitioning from a sole proprietorship to a larger entity with multiple owners or employees. However, now <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/limited-liability-company-vs-corporation-whats-best-for-your-business/"" target=""_blank"">businesses are more likely to be formed as limited liability companies</a>.<img class=""wp-image-18904 aligncenter"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/S-Corp-for-my-Business-2.jpg"" alt=""S Corporation Business a popular choice"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""> </p><p>Owners of corporations eligible to elect S status either must make an affirmative election or remain a C corporation. According to Forbes contributor Robert W. Wood, C corporations are the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/04/12/irs-form-that-can-save-your-small-business-millions-s-election/#7967b801e4de"" target=""_blank"">default status of all corporations</a>. Although <a href=""https://www.incorporate.com/c_corporation.html"" target=""_blank"">C corporations are the most common type of corporation in the U.S.</a> according to Incorporate.com, the S corporation status may be more beneficial.</p><h3>Deciding between the S- and C-corp</h3><blockquote><p><em>""...the main distinction between the two is that they are taxed very differently.""</em></p></blockquote><p>Many corporations are C corporations for tax purposes because they fail to satisfy certain technical requirements rendering them ineligible to elect S status. Both S and C corporations are entitled to limited liability protection, are owned by shareholders and are governed by a Board of Directors. Each corporation is designated as a separate legal entity and these concepts are familiar to most business owners. However, the main distinction between the two is that they are taxed very differently.</p><h3>Tax implications</h3><p>With an S corporation election, businesses receive the benefits of being taxed on a pass-through basis similar to a partnership or a limited liability company taxed as a partnership. S corporations are not taxed on its income; instead, that income is taxed to the shareholders.</p><p>The income of a C  corporations is taxed twice – once at the entity level where net income is subject to corporate tax rates and a second time at the shareholder level when dividend distributions are made.  An S corporation must make distributions with respect to stock that are in proportion to each shareholder’s ownership percentage. When compared to an S corporation, a partnership or LLC offers more flexibility in structuring different economic, managerial and voting arrangements among the participants.</p><h3>Fringe benefits</h3><blockquote><p><em>""...companies converting from C to S could be subject to additional corporate taxes...""</em></p></blockquote><p>There is a difference between a  C corporation and an S corporation with respect to fringe benefits as S corporations are subject to the more restrictive and less generous partnership rules.   A company could elect to be a C corporation for a while, then switch its status to that of an S corporation. It is also important to consider that companies converting from C to S could be subject to additional corporate taxes if it sells assets within five years of making theS election. This rule is designed to prevent a switch just prior to sale of the underlying business and it has thwarted many a retirement plan.</p><p>Many accountants favor S corporations because one-half of the self-employment taxes are paid by the corporation and dividend distributions escape self-employment tax, provided a reasonable salary is being paid to a shareholder who works for the S corporation.  S corporations do not have individual capital accounts for each shareholder which simplifies matters.</p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18905"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/S-Corp-for-my-Business.jpg"" alt=""Choosing a C or S Corporation Business"" width=""400"" height=""187"" /></p><h3>S corporation eligibility</h3><p>The S corporation election may be beneficial for a small business because it allows a company to have up to 100 shareholders in a calendar year. The shareholder rules are also favorable because it allows for U.S. citizens, resident aliens and qualifying trusts, which opens up share ownership to a wide audience. Non-residents are not eligible and not all trusts are eligible to own S stock. </p><p>When an S corporation acquires stock of another S corporation (target) it must make a special election to treat the target as a division. C corporations cannot own stock of an S corporation. Provided distributions on stock remain pro rata, S corporations may offer stock with  different voting rights. This feature enables small businesses to differentiate voting influence based on share ownership, but it is not as flexible as a limited liability company.</p><h3>Bottom line</h3><blockquote><p><em>""...the S corporation may be better suited to the needs of small businesses...""</em></p></blockquote><p>Both the C corporation and S corporation are similar corporate models, and both have their advantages. However, the S corporation may be better suited to the needs of small businesses, specifically because of one level of taxation on operating income and upon sale of the business.</p><p>The tax implications cannot be overstated because in the event that the business assets are sold, C corporations are taxed on proceeds of the sale and the shareholders are taxed again on the distribution. As S corporations are only taxed once at the shareholder level on a sale of assets, it is more tax efficient. Although a sale of S or C stock results in only one level of taxation and that is at the shareholder level, buyers are reluctant to purchase stock and assume the liabilities inherent in an existing corporation.</p>",,20160617,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/s-corporation-business/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/S-Corp-for-my-Business-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/S-Corp-for-my-Business.jpg,"S-Corp for my Business 2|S-Corp for my Business",,"In recent years, changes in tax laws have affected the way small businesses elect to be taxed.

18927,"What You Need to Know About Sexual Harassment in the Workplace","<h2 class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: center;"">Are you Doing Everything You Can to Avoid Sexual Harassment in the Workplace?</h2><p>Sexual harassment in the workplace claims account for a large percentage of employer lawsuits under both federal and state law.

Both statutes define “sexual harassment” broadly. On the federal level, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines sexual harassment as:</p><p><em>Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.</em></p><p>When workers behave badly, small businesses can also be held accountable. Under the doctrine of vicarious liability, an <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">employer can be held liable</a> for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor.</p><h3>Preventing the Liability of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace </h3><blockquote><p><em>""For small businesses, the most effective tool to prevent sexual harassment liability is to have comprehensive employee policies in place.""</em></p></blockquote><p>Under both New Jersey and federal law, <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/nj-supreme-court-sexual-harassment/"" target=""_blank"">having a strong anti-harassment policy in place</a> can shield businesses from liability so long as the worker did not suffer an adverse employment action, such as being terminated in retaliation for making a claim of sexual harassment.</p><p>More specifically, in a hostile work environment case, an employer may assert the affirmative defense that: 1) it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior;” 2) “the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise:” and 3) no adverse tangible employment action was taken against the plaintiff employee.</p><h3>Tips to Avoiding Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</h3><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18929"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-2.jpg"" alt=""sexual harassment in the workplace 2"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p>Accordingly, it is not only imperative to enact a policy, but also to enforce it consistently.

18933,"What You Need to Know About Term Sheets","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Term Sheets &amp; Their Role in Business</h2>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18936"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/term-sheets-1.jpg"" alt=""term sheets"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""> </p>
<p>Whether seeking to obtain financing, negotiating the purchase of real property, or entering into a partnership, most small business owners will encounter term sheets at some point. In its most basic form, a term sheet is a non-binding document that sets forth the material terms and conditions of a business agreement. It then serves as a blueprint for drafting the final contract.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Term Sheets</h3>
<p>When negotiating a complex business deal, a term sheet ensures that everyone is literally on the same page because key terms are outlined in bullet points. It also ensures that the parties have reached an understanding of at least the key elements involved in the deal before they spend additional time and resources to reach a formal legal agreement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>""...term sheets are often an essential part of securing financing...""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the parties are generally not bound to the elements of the agreement laid out in the term sheet, there are often two aspects of the document that are specifically stated to be legally binding. For instance, <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/dont-negotiate-without-it-tips-for-drafting-non-disclosure-provisions/"" target=""_blank"">term sheets may contain non-disclosure provisions</a> that require the parties to keep the negotiations confidential. Term sheets may also contain exclusivity provisions that prevent the one or both parties from negotiating with other potential business partners for a specified period of time. The provisions are intended to prevent businesses from using the term sheet to negotiate a better deal with someone else.</p>
<h3>The Role of Terms Sheets in Start-Up Funding</h3>
<p>For new and growing businesses, term sheets are often an <a href=""/practices/financing-group/"">essential part of securing financing</a>. Even though they are intended to be stripped down versions of the final agreement, term sheets can still be overwhelming for first-time entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>While the entire document should be carefully negotiated, below are some key provisions to watch out for when meeting with venture capital (VC) firms and other potential investors:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Valuation:</strong> Determining the price per share is clearly one of the most important terms. However, entrepreneurs should remember that a higher price is not always best. In some cases, agreeing to a slightly lower price can result in more favorable investment terms. In addition, start-ups should be cognizant of the impact a high valuation can have on successive rounds of financing.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Liquidation Preference:</strong> This provision determines the division of proceeds between shareholders (common and preferred) should the company be later liquidated via a sale, merger, etc. In essence, the liquidation preference dictates which parties get paid first and how much. Prior to agreeing to any liquidation preference, it is imperative to do the math to determine how much the venture capital funders and the company founders will receive under each scenario.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Vesting Schedules: </strong>Term sheets may be used to establish a vesting schedule for stock and/or options held by company management, employees, and even those held by founders. VC's often seek to negotiate for the founders to re-vest their equity over time, it is important that all founders are on the same page in terms of stock allocation and vesting, i.e. monthly vesting over a period of years. Other issues to address include what happens if one of the founders leaves the company due to resignation, termination, or even death/incapacitation; in addition, there may be potential negative tax consequences to be considered in the event of re-vesting.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Board Structure: </strong>Board composition and structure is another key issue addressed in a term sheet with investors. While bringing in outsiders is often essential to growing a business, founders should be mindful of how this will impact the day-to-day operations of the business. Key issues to consider include the skill sets of board members, what decisions will require board approval, and voting procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>While term sheets can be headache-inducing for small business owners, experienced lawyers are well-versed in how to <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">negotiate and document complex business transactions</a>. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with experienced counsel early in the process rather than simply relying on your attorney to draft the final contract.</p>",,20160630,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/term-sheets-in-business/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/term-sheets-3.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/term-sheets-1.jpg,"term sheets 3|term sheets 1",,"For new and growing businesses, term sheets are often an essential part of securing financing.

However, before the terms are even laid out, prospective buyers need to be aware of several red flags. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These range in severity, but they could prove to become serious problems down the road:</span></p><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1. Litigation involving the current franchisee</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""/practices/litigation/"">Litigation is common</a> for most franchises. However, multiple open lawsuits are a red flag; particularly if the franchisor is involved with several suits against its own franchisees. Not only is this a potential risk for the franchisee, but it's also alarming for the franchise system itself. This is particularly concerning especially if litigation is resolved with drawn-out lawsuits, because the prospective buyer could see a substantial portion of his or her profits impacted in the future.</span></p><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2. No designations for protected territories</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Without designated territories for a franchise, the prospective owner could face new entrants in his market - even from franchisees in the same franchise system. According to a recent CNBC report, there is a tremendous window of risk that prospective owners walk through if they sign a franchise agreement without <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/11/the-7-most-important-franchise-business-terms-to-negotiate.html"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">proper designation of protected territories</span></a>.</span></p><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3. Renewal rights are not perpetual</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Perpetual <a href=""/business-franchise-distribution/"">renewal rights clauses in franchise agreements</a> are vital, specifically in the event of a future sale. With term franchise deals, let's say for 10 years, any attempt to sell the franchise without a perpetual renewal rights provision makes the business significantly less valuable. Prospective buyers will not want to buy a business that will run out after the 10th year, and your ROI will be much lower than expected after years of building the business.</span></p><p class=""p1""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18947"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/franchise-agreement-2.jpg"" alt=""franchise agreement"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p class=""image_arrange"" style=""text-align: right;""> </p><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">4. Be wary of depreciated value</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is perhaps the most complicated red flag on the list. According to CNBC, this could also prove to be the most financially devastating for franchisees. If a buyer wants to acquire the company years later, or if the franchise company wants to buy the business at the end of the ownership deal, and there is no provision included in the prospective owner's current franchise agreement against depreciated value, it could cost the franchisee dearly.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If a buyer is allowed to acquire the owner's franchise at the ""depreciated cost value of assets"", it substantially lowers the value of the owner's net profits on the sale. The way this works is that regardless of the owner's gross sales and net income, prospective buyers will only calculate the depreciated value of the initial investment. CNBC provided an example: If the owner held the franchise for 20 years with a $500,000 investment, that depreciated value could be $20,000. Needless to say, that is a potentially crippling blow.</span></p><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">5. Closings of other franchisees</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is an obvious aspect to look out for because you want to gauge how many franchises have <a href=""http://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/franchising/6-big-red-flags-avoid-buying-franchise/#sm.0001d0vrpz38rflmyna2as4571i6o"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">closed or opened recently</span></a>, according to a QuickBooks Intuit report. In the case of Pink Berry for example, this was a popular franchise with a growth spurt that sold a lot of new units. On the flip side was Chipotle, which was a once popular franchise that recently closed several stores, showed how a company's growth potential could change instantly with consumer preferences.</span></p><blockquote><p class=""p1""><em>""...the issues listed above not only expose you to risk, but also to financially devastating consequences in the event of a future sale.""</em></p></blockquote><h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bottom line for prospective franchisees in a franchise deal</span></h3><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These are just a few examples, but you should walk away from the negotiating table if any of these red flags come up. The issues listed not only expose you to risk, but also to financially devastating consequences in the event of a future sale.</span></p><p class=""p1"">If you have any questions about franchises or are considering a potential franchise deal, please contact me, <a href=""/attorneys/anthony-r-caruso-esq/"">Anthony Caruso</a>.</p>",,20160705,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/franchise-deal-411/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/franchise-agreement.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/franchise-agreement-2.jpg,"franchise agreement|franchise agreement 2",,"Negotiations over a potential franchise deal can be difficult since there are several aspects that need to be hashed out.

As a result, the District of Columbia, Guam, and more than 20 states have legalized medical marijuana use.</p><h3>Medical marijuana in NJ</h3><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18963"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Compassionate-Use-Medical-Marijuana-Act-2.jpg"" alt=""Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p><a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/will-new-jersey-legalize-marijuana/"" target=""_blank"">Medical marijuana use was legalized in the Garden State</a> in 2010 with <a href=""ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/PL09/307_.HTM"" target=""_blank"">the enactment of the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act</a> (the “Act”). The New Jersey Department of Health implemented the Act by creating the New Jersey Medical Marijuana Program (“MMP”). The MMP authorizes approved physicians to disburse up to two ounces of medical marijuana to a registered patient during any 30-day period to treat numerous “debilitating medical conditions,” particularly where conventional treatments are ineffective or exacerbate a patient’s suffering.</p><p>These conditions include seizure disorders, including epilepsy, skeletal muscular spasticity, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, cancer, muscular dystrophy, and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with terminal illness may also enter the MMP where a physician provides a prognosis of fewer than 12 months of life.</p><p>Private employers in New Jersey have had a difficult time reconciling their workplace processes and policies with the intricacies of the MMP. These difficulties have often resulted in terminations of employees based on their status as MMP patients, or because they tested positive for medical marijuana. Consequently, some MMP patients have filed wrongful termination lawsuits against their former employers.      </p><h3>Proposed amendment to ""the Act""</h3><p>A bill currently passed before the Legislature is designed to amend the Act to address this issue. The bill serves to clarify the rights and obligations of employers, employees, and job applicants regarding hiring and termination decisions in situations involving medical marijuana use.  </p><p>The bill, S2161/A2482 (the “Amendment”), proposes the following:</p><ul style=""list-style-type: square;""><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Employers would be prohibited from discriminating against a job applicant or terminating an employee based on the individual’s status as an MMP patient or based on a positive marijuana test result.</li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">In situations where an applicant or employee tests positive for marijuana, the Amendment would require requires employers to provide written notice to the individual stating that she may, within three days of the positive test result, request and pay for a confirmatory retest of the original sample or present a legitimate medical explanation for the test result.  </li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">If the lawful use of medical marijuana caused a qualified job applicant’s positive test result, then the Amendment prohibits the employer from using the result as a basis for refusing to hire the applicant.</li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">If an employee’s positive test result was caused by the lawful use of medical marijuana, then the Amendment prohibits the employer from terminating the employee unless the employer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee’s use of medical marijuana has resulted in “specific articulable symptoms while working that decrease or lessen the employee’s performance of the duties or tasks of the employee’s job position.”</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>""The Amendment provides employers with significant legal protections.""</em></p></blockquote><h3>Benefits of the Amendment</h3><p>The Amendment provides employers with significant legal protections. Notably, the Amendment would not restrict an employer’s ability to prohibit the possession or use of “intoxicating substances” during work hours or to take related adverse employment action. Also, in recognition of the illegality of marijuana use under federal law, the Amendment specifically states that it would not require employers to commit any act that would cause the employer to be in violation of federal law, or that would result in the loss of a federal contract or federal funding.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18964"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Compassionate-Use-Medical-Marijuana-Act.jpg"" alt=""Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p>The language of the Amendment gives rise to several questions, especially with respect to the amount of discretion granted to employers regarding current employees. For example, what “specific articulable symptoms” might employers successfully cite to terminate an employee based on medical marijuana use? What metrics would employers be required to use to demonstrate a decrease or lessening of an employee’s job performance? To what degree would an employee’s performance have to decrease to support termination? What recourse would be available to terminated employees?</p><h3>When will the amendment go through Legislature?</h3><p>It is highly likely that the Amendment will then be revised as it proceeds through the Legislature. New Jersey employers and MMP patients should act now to familiarize themselves with the Amendment and should closely monitor related developments this fall to stay apprised of their respective rights and obligations.</p>",,20160628,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/news/uncategorized/proposed-amendment-to-medical-marijuana-act/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Compassionate-Use-Medical-Marijuana-Act-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Compassionate-Use-Medical-Marijuana-Act.jpg,"Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act 2|Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act",,"The use, possession, sale, cultivation, and transportation of marijuana, whether for recreational or medical use, is illegal under federal law.

It specifically held that that <a href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1686064.html"" target=""_blank"">in order to sustain a conviction for insider trading</a>, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the tippee knew that an insider disclosed confidential information and that he did so in exchange for a personal benefit. With regard to establishing a personal benefit, the appeals court further ruled that the prosecution must provide “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.”<strong> </strong></p><h3>The First Circuit’s Insider Trading Decision</h3><p>The First Circuit case, <em>United States v.

18991,"Five Tips for Taking the IPO Plunge","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Considering Going Public? Here are 5 IPO Tips You Should Consider</h2><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18995"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IPO-1.jpg"" alt=""IPO"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p>The number of initial public offerings (IPO’s) is down 60 percent in the second quarter of 2016. There were only 33 IPOs as compared to 72 in the second quarter of 2015. However, while the IPO market has been relatively quiet in 2016, the firms that have made the plunge have been very successful.</p><p>According to IPOScoop.com, the <a href=""https://www.iposcoop.com/"" target=""_blank"">total return of IPOs so far this year</a> is more than 24 percent, with only eight companies seeing stocks decline. The trend highlights that in turbulent financial times, the companies that decide to become public are often candidates with the strongest support.</p><h3>Is Your Company Ready for an IPO?</h3><p>Before deciding to take your company public, it is important to understand both the risks <em>and</em> the rewards. While businesses taking the IPO route receive the “clout” associated with being a publicly traded company, they also face costly and burdensome regulatory obligations. A <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/en_us/us/transaction-services/publications/assets/pwc-cost-of-ipo.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2012 survey by accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP</a> revealed that “while initial public offerings (IPOs) provide companies an opportunity to reinvent themselves, many of them embark upon the process without a thorough understanding of the costs, time and complexity associated with both going public and being public.”</p><h3>Important Points to Consider</h3><p>To give your IPO the best chance of success, it is important to be prepared and to go into the process with an understanding of how to best take advantage of the benefits and how to avoid certain traps. Below are a few specific tips:</p><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Understand the risks and benefits</strong>: IPOs are not for everyone. That’s why the majority of companies are private. Before embarking on the process, it is imperative to fully evaluate whether an IPO is the best option. Advantages include access to capital, liquidity, and greater public exposure, while the disadvantages include increased pressure to perform financially, requirements to disclose confidential information, and additional reporting requirements. Trading in your securities may result in fluctuating pricing, volume and valuation changes (both up and down) which may have more to do with how your industry or the world economy is viewed than with the prospects for or results of your company’s business. A current example of this is evident with regard to the biotech industry, which expert analysts say is trading exactly that way for much of the industry.</li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Prepare early and often</strong>: A company can never be too prepared for an IPO. Prior to even registering an IPO, you must meet certain financial requirements. For example, the SEC requires three years of audited financial statements for larger offerings, although newer companies and smaller offerings may file pursuant to lesser requirements. All of the exchanges also have minimum income and valuation requirements for entry. Companies may also need to update their financial reporting systems to comply with filing requirements.</li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Put your best foot forward</strong>: Your prospectus and other marketing documents are your primary opportunity to attract investors and convince them that your company is a good buy. When drafting the prospectus, issuing companies seek to promote the prospects for their companies while also meeting strict disclosure requirements for risk factors. Striking the proper balance requires input from attorneys, accountants and management.</li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Call in the experts</strong>: A successful IPO requires the advice of both financial and legal experts. Whether you seek assistance from in-house staff or outside professionals, it is important to work with qualified individuals who have experience with <a href=""/practices/securities-offerings-and-corporate-disclosure/"">guiding companies through the IPO process</a>.</li></ul><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Understand your regulatory obligations</strong>: An IPO involves far more than selling your securities to the public. Often the most complex part of the process is meeting your regulatory obligations under both the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Securities Act of 1933</a> and the <a href=""http://www.soxlaw.com/"" target=""_blank"">Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002</a>. In addition to the SEC’s filing requirements, companies may also be required to record documents with the relevant stock exchanges, FINRA and State Blue Sky authorities.</li></ul><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-18996"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IPO-2.jpg"" alt=""IPO"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p><em>Is your business considering going public?

With just eight justices on the bench dealing with this Supreme Court vacancy, the Court has split 4-4 in several key cases and issued narrow rulings in several others after being unable to achieve a consensus.</p><h3>Merrick Garland nomination</h3><p>In response to the vacancy, President Barack <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/scotus"" target=""_blank"">Obama has nominated Merrick Garland</a>, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. However, Republicans have refused to act on the nomination, arguing that the task of nominating a new Supreme Court justice should be left to the next President after the November election. However, even if the new President makes a nomination upon entering office in January, the Senate confirmation process and the Court’s schedule are likely to lead to result in the Supreme Court not deciding cases with nine justices until the fall of 2018.</p><h3>Letter from general counsels</h3><p>Recently, the general counsels of 44 major U.S. companies wrote a letter urging the U.S. Senate to consider Merrick Garland's nomination. Signatories included the GCs of 3M Corp., Nike Inc., Qualcomm Inc., International Paper, Reddit, Sony Music Entertainment, and SanDisk Corporation, among other leading corporations.

Garland's ""intellect, legal experience and judicial temperament render him exceptionally well-qualified,"" they wrote.</p><p>The letter also raised concerns about the impact of a lengthy Supreme Court vacancy on the country’s highest court, stating “the business community has a great interest in avoiding the legal uncertainty that could result if the vacancy remains unfilled for an extended period of time.” The GCs further wrote:</p><p><em>These companies depend on the certainty of timely judicial decisions to help us advise our management teams and employees and to provide clarity to our shareholders and the markets.  The Supreme Court plays a vital role in this regard, frequently granting certiorari in cases involving important business issues such as intellectual property rights, labor and employment law, administrative law, securities law, and many other areas of great importance to those engaged in commercial activity.  While these types of issues can sometimes be decided by a majority from among eight sitting justices, we are concerned about the uncertainties and delays to the impartial administration of justice that could arise if the Court is left without a tie-breaking ninth vote for an extended period of time.</em></p><h3><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19007"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Supreme-Court-Vacancy-2.jpg"" alt=""Supreme Court Vacancy"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></h3><h3>In conclusion</h3><p>The letter highlights that the <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">business community is being impacted by the Supreme Court vacancy</a> and the resulting potential for a 4-4 tie, such as just occurred regarding immigration law.

In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently held that employers can’t amend that deadline by contract.</p><h3>Facts of the Employment Lawsuit</h3><p>During the hiring process to become a delivery driver for Raymour Furniture Company, Inc. (Raymour), Plaintiff Sergio Rodriguez (Rodriguez) completed a two-page application form. Rodriguez completed the application with the assistance of a friend, as he contends his ability to read or speak English is limited.</p><p>The application stated in capital letters: “I agree that any claim or lawsuit relating to my service with Raymour &amp; Flanigan must be filed no more than six (6) months after the date of the employment action that is the subject of the claim or lawsuit. I waive any statute of limitations to the contrary.” It also contained the following warning: “Read carefully before signing—if you are hired, the following becomes part of your official employment record and personnel file.”</p><p>After working for several years, Rodriguez was terminated during a company-wide reduction in force (RIF). While Raymour stated that the employment decision was performance-related, Rodriguez subsequently <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">filed a wrongful termination suit under the NJLAD</a>, alleging that he was terminated in retaliation for having filed a workers' compensation claim and was discriminated against based upon disability.</p><p>In response, Raymour cited the six-month deadline for filing suit set forth in the application as grounds for dismissal. In response, Rodriguez argued that the shortened limitation period was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the Appellate Division affirmed.</p><p>While the appeals court concluded that the employment application amounted to a contract of adhesion, it determined that it was enforceable in light of its clear, unambiguous language and the ample time plaintiff had to review it. The appeals court further held that, absent a controlling prohibitory statute, parties may modify a statute of limitations if the shortened time period is reasonable and does not violate public policy.</p><h3>New Jersey Supreme Court’s Decision</h3><p>The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed <a href=""http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A2714SvRay.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the Appellate Division’s decision in <em>Rodriguez v. Raymour Furniture Company, Inc.</em></a> It held that “a private agreement that frustrates the LAD’s public-purpose imperative by shortening the two-year limitations period for private LAD claims cannot be enforced.”</p><p>In reaching its decision, the state’s highest court focused on the public-interest purpose of the LAD, which “seeks unequivocally to eradicate discrimination against any of New Jersey’s inhabitants.” As Justice Jaynee LaVecchia further explained, ""The challenged provision cannot be viewed as a private contractual agreement by which private parties contract to limit private claims by shortening the generally applicable statute of limitations for such action.”</p><p>With regard to the importance of the NJLAD two-year time period for filing suit and the consequence of shortening it, Justice LaVecchia wrote:</p><p><em>[A] shortening of that period undermines and thwarts the legislative scheme by effectively divesting the aggrieved party of the right to pursue an administrative remedy. Additionally, since claimants may not immediately be aware of their cognizable claims, shortening of the period will effectively eliminate claims and frustrate the public policy of uniformity and certainty. Conversely, the shortened period may also compel attorneys to file premature LAD actions. Finally, the two-year period also allows an employer the opportunity to protect itself and promote the eradication of discrimination by investigating and resolving complaints before an LAD claim is filed. </em></p><p>Although the court’s decision focused on the NJLAD, it noted that it would have also invalidated the employee agreement based on the issue of unconscionability. “[B]ecause the provision at question was contained within an employment application and plaintiff could not bargain, the contract was one of adhesion, containing indicia of procedural unconscionability,” the court held.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19019"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NJLAD-Lawsuits-2.jpg"" alt=""NJLAD Lawsuits"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><h3>Message for New Jersey Employers</h3><p>The New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision makes it clear that the statute of limitations under the NJLAD is two years and that time period cannot be amended by employers through a private agreement. Therefore, if any of your employment applications, contracts, or employee policies limit workers’ time to sue, <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">they should be revised immediately</a>.</p><p>With respect to NJLAD compliance, the decision highlights that the court is committed to advancing the policy objectives behind the law. Therefore, <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">New Jersey employers should put themselves in the best position to defend a suit</a> by properly documenting performance issues, conducting regular training regarding retaliation and harassment, and thoroughly investigating and documenting any claims of discrimination.</p>",,20160715,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/no-limits-for-njlad-lawsuits/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NJLAD-Lawsuits.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NJLAD-Lawsuits-2.jpg,"NJLAD Lawsuits|NJLAD Lawsuits 2",,"Under New Jersey’s statute of limitations, workers generally have two years to file an employment lawsuit under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD).

Although policies do vary, most general liability policies share similar components. This article addresses the basic anatomy of a commercial insurance contract. In the coming weeks, we will address specific areas of concern for Monmouth County businesses.</p><h3>Key components in a commercial insurance contract</h3><p>In basic terms, a commercial insurance contract transfers the risk of loss from one party (the insured) to another party (the insurer). In return for the payment of certain premiums, the insurer promises to pay the insured, or third parties on the insured’s behalf, an amount of money for a covered loss.</p><p>General liability policies can cover common losses arising out of the conduct of a business; including products and completed operations, contractual liability, bodily and personal injury and advertising liability. Below are the key structural components:</p><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Declarations Page: </strong>The first section of the commercial insurance contract identifies the insured, the risks or property that are covered, the policy limits, and the policy period. It is imperative to verify that the name of your business is correct and that the premiums, policy limits, and policy period reflect what was discussed with your agent.</li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Insuring Agreement: </strong>This section describes the insurer’s duties under the contract. For instance, the insurance company generally promises to pay losses for covered perils, provide specified services, and agrees to defend the insured in a liability lawsuit.<strong> </strong></li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Exclusions/Limitations: </strong>This section removes certain perils, losses, and/or property from coverage under the policy. Examples of common exclusions in general liability policies include items covered under other policies such as workers compensation liability, unemployment, and disability law obligations; and <a href=""/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-law/"">liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA).<strong> </strong></li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Conditions/Warranties: </strong>This part of the insurance policy sets forth the conditions that must be met in order for coverage to apply when a loss occurs. It is important for a policyholder to read this section from time to time, and when a claim occurs, because non-compliance can be grounds for the insurer to deny coverage. Common requirements may include various notice requirements, filing a proof of loss with the company, safeguarding property after a loss, and cooperating with the insurer’s investigation or legal defense.</li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Endorsements/Riders:</strong> Insurers often amend the terms of the original insurance contracts upon renewal. Endorsements and riders are silently used to make additions, deletions, or modifications to key terms of the policy -- so it is important to notice and review them whenever they are received.</li></ul><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19047"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/commercial-insurance-contract.jpg"" alt=""commercial insurance contract"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p><em>Are you still unsure regarding the basics of a commercial insurance contract?

Yet the large majority of cases are still resolved short of going to trial - this is where commercial litigation settlements will come into play.<strong> <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19060"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/commercial-litigation-settlements.jpg"" alt=""commercial litigation settlements"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></strong>In the State of New York, a new rule recently took effect that is intended to encourage court-facilitated settlement discussions. In cases heard by the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court, the parties can now jointly request the court to appoint a judge, other than the one assigned to hear the case, to conduct a settlement conference.</p><h3>The new rule encouraging commercial litigation settlements</h3><p>The <a href=""https://www.nycourts.gov/rules/comments/orders/AO121-16.pdf"" target=""_blank"">amended Rule 22 NYCRR 202.70(g)</a> specifically states:</p><p><em>Should counsel wish to proceed with a settlement conference before a justice other than the justice assigned to the case, counsel may jointly request that the assigned justice grant a separate settlement conference. This request may be made at any time in the litigation. Such a request will be granted in the discretion of the justice assigned to the case upon finding that a separate settlement conference would be beneficial to the parties and the court and would further the interests of justice. If the request is granted, the assigned justice shall make appropriate arrangements for the designation of a ""settlement judge."" </em></p><p>As highlighted by the Commercial Division Advisory Council, the rule is intended to encourage candid settlement discussions “without telegraphing the weaknesses in a case to the presiding trial judge.” The rule also aims to assist trial judges who are often reluctant to get involved in negotiations of a matter that they may ultimately be asked to decide. In support of the rule, the Council also noted that the practice is used on the federal level, where district court judges routinely assign a magistrate judge or an independent court-appointed mediator to hear settlement conferences.</p><h3>Why the new rule is good</h3><p>As we have discussed on our <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/"" target=""_blank"">Business Law News Blog</a>, there are <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-york-and-new-jersey-business-litigation-settle-or-go-to-trial/"" target=""_blank"">several advantages of negotiating a settlement</a>.

For instance, <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">resolving business litigation out of court</a> is almost always more cost-effective and will always take less time than a trial. In addition, settlement often allows the two sides to explore more creative solutions, such as payments over time, or exchanging different assets from those in dispute.

However, she was ultimately convicted under federal law for misleading investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This is why it is important to know your rights while under federal investigation.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19073"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/federal-investigation-2.jpg"" alt=""federal investigation"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><h3>Lying to the Government Is a Crime<strong> </strong></h3><p>Most business professionals do not expect the FBI or SEC to come walking through their door. However, it can be easy to get tangled up in a federal investigation, particularly given prosecutors’ growing focus on white-collar crimes. Should the unthinkable occur, it is essential to be prepared and understand your rights.</p><blockquote><p><em>Understandably, most people panic when the FBI comes to their door.</em></p></blockquote><p>Most importantly, what you say to federal investigators, as well as how and when you say it, can have a significant effect on the future of you and your company. <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001"" target=""_blank"">Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001</a> makes it a crime to:</p><ul><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Knowingly and willfully; </li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Make any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or</li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">representation;</li><li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">In any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative or judicial branch of the United States.</li></ul><p>The <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-903-false-statements-concealment-18-usc-1001"" target=""_blank"">false statements statute applies even if your lie is oral</a> and not under oath. It also applies if the government is not actually influenced by your falsehood. During interviews, investigators often have more information than you realize and will act dumb to lull you into a false sense of security. Simply denying knowledge about illegal conduct has been determined to be a violation of the federal statute.</p><h3>Protecting Your Legal Rights</h3><p>Understandably, most people panic when the FBI comes to their door. Many believe that not talking to investigators makes them look guilty and more likely to blurt out little lies to cover up small misdeeds and protect themselves. Others will lie and say they know nothing about the alleged crimes.</p><p>Consider the following hypothetical:</p><p><em>You are the former employee of a corrupt company. You hated the place, left as soon as you could, and did your best while there not to join in the fraud you saw being committed all around you. Nevertheless, you looked the other way and, on occasion, minimally aided the owner’s criminal behavior. When investigators show up at your new place of employment and start asking questions, what is the best course of action?</em></p><p>Rather than panic and lie, the best way to handle the situation is to calmly and politely decline their request for an interview in order to obtain legal advice. First and foremost, you are not qualified to know for sure whether any of your <a href=""/practices/criminal-defense/"">past actions could constitute a criminal offense</a>. Second, you may unwittingly make factual mistakes during your interview which could constitute a violation of Section 1001.

Politely declining the request to interview is not the same as remaining completely silent, which can later be used against you. You don’t have to (and shouldn’t) provide any explanation.

First, for <a href=""/practices/mergers-and-acquisitions/"">businesses contemplating a merger or acquisition</a>, the fee hikes highlight that it is imperative to determine if the transaction will trigger pre-merger notification requirements under the HSR Act. Under the statute, companies proposing a merger or acquisition must notify regulators and satisfy a mandatory waiting period (usually 30 days) if the size of the parties involved and the value of the transaction exceeds certain filing thresholds, absent an applicable exemption.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19080"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FTC-fines-2.jpg"" alt=""FTC fines"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p><p>Second, for continuing violations, each day is a separate violation. As a result, the maximum civil penalty may be multiplied by the number of days for each violation of the applicable statute. Third, courts will apply a multi-factor test in assessing whether a maximum fee could be mitigated. These factors include the degree of culpability of the violator, prior history of the violator’s conduct, the violator’s ability to pay, and the effect on the violator’s ability to continue to do business.

Estate of Vernon G. Browne</u></a>, alleged that the Estate, as successor to Vernon G. Browne, was liable for the cost of remediating environmental contamination at a property formerly owned by <a href=""http://www.orbiscorporation.com/"" target=""_blank"">Orbis Corporation</a> at 55 Virginia Street in Newark, New Jersey. Plaintiffs’ claims were brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended by the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986), the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (“the Spill Act”), and New Jersey statutory and common law.</p>
<p>Defendant Vernon G. Browne was a financial and administrative Vice President and a Director of Orbis Corporation’s parent company Norda, Inc.  Plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Browne was personally liable for the costs of remediation at the Orbis Newark Property because he had directly participated in the management and control of Orbis during the years the alleged environmental violations had occurred at the property.</p>
<p>The Court determined that Plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence that Mr. Browne (i) had any personal knowledge of the physical conditions or operations at the Orbis Newark plant, (ii) that he actually participated in operating the plant or in activities resulting in the disposal of hazardous substances at the property, or (iii) that he actually exercised control or was involved in Orbis’ operations. The Court accordingly found that Mr. Browne was not liable under CERCLA, the New Jersey Spill Act, and New Jersey statutory and common law.</p>
<p>The Court also rejected the expert testimony of Plaintiffs’ expert Richard Greenberg relating to the cost of remediation of the environmental contamination, finding it to be speculative and lacking in foundation.  The court noted that Mr. Greenberg did not conduct any independent analysis or work at the property, that he made mistakes in his expert report regarding the location of buildings and whether they were still standing, and acknowledged that he did not know the locations on the property where the prior consultant had collected soil samples.  </p>
<p>Moreover, he was unable to confirm where on the property the prior consultant had found environmental contamination which needed to be remediated.</p>
<p>Mr. Scagnelli explained that “The decision is particularly noteworthy because the Court held that, to recover response costs under CERCLA Section 107, Plaintiffs needed to show that they had incurred necessary response costs, which the Court found Plaintiffs had also failed to do. The Court further held that to impose personal, individual liability for the clean-up costs under the New Jersey Spill Act on employees or officers of companies responsible for a discharge, evidence needed to be presented which justified piercing the corporate veil, which Plaintiffs also failed to do.”</p>

The deal would break down trade barriers that limit movement of goods in the Pacific Rim. The 12 member nations <a href=""https://ustr.gov/tpp/overview-of-the-TPP"" target=""_blank"">comprise about 40 percent</a> of the world's gross domestic product. If the free trade agreement were to pass in all participating nations, guitar manufacturers would be able to move materials and components across borders more affordably and easily. </p><p>[tweet https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/741288931027652608 width='100' align='center']</p><h3>Music industry affected by trade deals in the past </h3><p><a href=""http://www.musictrades.com/news1.html"" target=""_blank"">Music Trades Magazine name checked two trade policy changes</a> in a discussion of how agreements such as TPP or <a href=""https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta"" target=""_blank"">the North American Free Trade Agreement</a> affect guitar companies.  </p><p>First was several companies' accusation that Japanese manufacturers were dumping cheap static and dynamic random access memory chips into the U.S. market in the 1980s, the publication explained. These devices were important components in many electronic instruments. The manufacturers' strategy dragged down the cost of SRAMs and DRAMs. As a result, <a href=""https://www.usitc.gov/"" target=""_blank"">the International Trade Commission</a> levied a 50 percent punitive duty on Japanese memory chips. </p><blockquote><p><em>Trade regulation can have a substantial effect on instrument manufacturers' growth, as well as the prices of their products. </em></p></blockquote><p>Immediately, U.S.-based instrument manufacturers had to pay twice as much as their Japanese competitors did for memory chips. U.S. companies quickly found themselves at a disadvantage in the global market. </p><p>About a decade later, NAFTA proved to be a boon for some domestic guitar manufacturers. While across the industry as a whole, results varied - woodwind manufacturers, for example, suffered losses as a result of the trade deal - guitar companies were among those who benefited. From 1995 to 2015, the U.S. trade deficit in acoustic guitars shrunk from $13.7 million to $8.5 million. In the twenty years since NAFTA, string manufacturers actually experienced a trade surplus.</p><h3>TPP could keep guitars affordable<strong> </strong></h3><p><br /> Building a guitar in the U.S. can be expensive - so much so that a guitar built here would require a price of $1,000 or more to generate profit, Music Trades Magazine explained. For this reason, manufacturers need to be able to affordably move various components across borders. NAFTA certainly illustrated this, and TPP could have a similar effect. However, guitar-makers shouldn't get their hopes up just yet. <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19108"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TPP-2.jpg"" alt=""TPP"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate, is opposed to TPP and hopes to implement a blanket 45 percent tariff on Chinese, Japanese and Mexican imports, the publication noted. This would almost certainly make manufacturing guitars and buying them more expensive. Hilary Clinton, the assumed Democratic nominee, has also expressed disapproval, saying that TPP needs to be rewritten. For guitar makers hoping for a TPP boost, a sliver of hope still remains. However, opposition toward the agreement, both in the U.S. and abroad, ensures the path toward Pacific free trade will be rocky. </p><p><em>Are you an instrument manufacturer concerned about the future of TPP?

In addition, 25 percent of the companies report that they have terminated an employee for misusing email.</p><p>Nonetheless, the legal principles that govern employers who monitor employee email accounts are complex and evolving. The legal construction of employer surveillance largely depends on the computer, email, or other relevant policies that have been adopted by the employer and communicated to the affected employees. However, in <a href=""/practices/labor-employment/"">employment lawsuits involving email searches</a> by companies without policies authorizing such searches, the courts have still largely sided with employers, particularly if they had a compelling business reason to read the email.</p><h3><em>City of Ontario v.

In the unanimous decision, the Court held that the text message search did not violate the <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-04/"" target=""_blank"">Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizure</a> because it was legitimately work-related.</p><h3>What employers should do</h3><blockquote><p>""...the legal principles that govern employers who monitor employee email accounts are complex and evolving...""</p></blockquote><p>To avoid liability, employee handbooks should make it clear that employees should have no expectation of privacy when it come to their work email accounts. For instance, the policies may expressly state that the systems are owned by the company and therefore can be accessed without notification or permission. These types of limitations are strengthened to the extent that the employer insists that its email system is used exclusively for business-related communications. It is recommended that employees are officially warned that “electronic files, e-mail, data files, images, software, and voice mail may be accessed at any time by management or other authorized personnel for any business purpose.”<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19146"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/search-employee-emails-2.jpg"" alt=""search employee emails"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Even if the employers’ policies allow searches without notification, it is advised to keep employees apprised of such searches, provided it does not compromise the investigation. For instance, if conducting a sensitive sexual harassment investigation, the employer likely would not want the target employee to be given advance notification until the third party investigation has been completed. However, if management is investigating an email security breach or virus in the system, keeping all employees informed may actually help facilitate the process.</p><p>In any case, it is generally good practice to inform employees after the search has been conducted. This not only helps to maintain transparency and trust, but also reminds staff of the relevant policies regarding email monitoring.</p><p>This is an area of law that continues to evolve almost daily so it is very important to monitor all developments to insure that your policies align with current legal requirements.</p><p><em>If you have any questions regarding how to deal with your business' email security or would like to discuss this matter further, please contact me, <a href=""/attorneys/gary-s-young/"">Gary Young</a>.</em></p>",,20160720,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/labor-employment/search-employee-emails/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/search-employee-emails-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/search-employee-emails.jpg,"search employee emails 2|search employee emails",,"This question regarding whether employers reserve the right to search employee emails has become very controversial.

19157,"What are the Legal Implications of Music Sampling?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The legality of music sampling</h2><p>Music sampling is one of the most frequent — and controversial — practices in the music industry. It involves taking pre-existing sound recordings and repurposing them in a new musical composition. The extent of the music sample can range from the entire chorus of a song to just a few notes.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19163"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/music-sampling-1.jpg"" alt=""music sampling"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh's 1985 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icBflcYZhpo"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop classic ""La Di Da Di""</a> has been sampled hundreds of times by artists ranging from Notorious B.I.G to Miley Cyrus. However, samples don’t always come from chart-topping hits; with the explosion of YouTube and other websites, using a piece of another song, whether it's recorded in a basement or a major studio, can be as easy as clicking a mouse.</p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Music Copyrights</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When seeking to “borrow” part of another song, it is imperative to understand the legal rights involved.</p><p>A song typically involves two copyrights, one for the musical composition and one for the sound recording. As <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf"" target=""_blank"">described by the U.S. Copyright Office</a>, a musical composition consists of music, including any accompanying words. The author of a musical composition is generally the composer, and the lyricist, if any. A musical composition may be in the form of a notated copy (i.e., sheet music) or in the form of a phonorecord (i.e., cassette tape, LP, or CD).</p><p>A sound recording results from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds. The author of a sound recording is the performer(s) whose performance is fixed, or the record producer who processes the sounds and fixes them in the final recording, or both. In many cases, the copyrights may be registered by two different entities.</p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Grounds for Infringement</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">successful copyright infringement claim</a> requires proof of two elements: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. The first element is readily satisfied if the copyright is registered with the United States Copyright Office. With regard to the second element, courts typically examine (1) whether the alleged copier had access to the copyrighted work and (2) whether the works are substantially similar. Since most songs are widely available via the Internet, most cases revolve around whether the works are substantially similar.</p><blockquote><p><em>If you fail to obtain the proper licenses, you may not be able to release your song and may face a costly copyright infringement lawsuit.</em></p></blockquote><p>In music sampling cases, the inquiry largely focuses on how much of the song is used. In a 2006 case involving a N.W.A. rap song that sampled a Funkadelic riff (<a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2589269115679339204&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"" target=""_blank""><em>Bridgeport Music, Inc., v. Dimension Films</em></a>), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that any music sampling is too much. According to the court, ""Get a license or do not sample. We do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way.""</p><p>However, in 2016, contrary to the Sixth Circuit rule set forth in <em>Bridgeport</em>, the <em>de minimis</em> exception to copyright infringement was used in the music sampling context. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Madonna’s song “Vogue” sampled a horn hit, less than a second in length, from the 1976 song called “Love Break.” The Court held that the sampling was <em>de minimis,</em> small enough to be trivial, and was therefore not copyright infringement.</p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Legal Implications of Music Sampling</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>De minimis</em> or not, unauthorized music sampling can carry significant penalties.</p></blockquote><p>First, the Copyright Act empowers courts to award attorney’s fees and costs to successful litigants, meaning the unsuccessful litigant will have to pay for the other party’s attorney’s fees. 17 U.S. Code § 505.</p><p>Second, for each work that the defendant is found to have infringed, the plaintiff copyright owner is entitled to receive its choice of actual damages plus the infringer’s profits or statutory damages. The Copyright Act provides for statutory damages from $750 to $30,000 per act as the court considers just; and up to $150,000 if the court finds that the infringement was committed willfully. 17 U.S. Code § 504. If the copyright owner elects, it may recover the actual damages suffered as a result of the infringement, plus any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement. 17 U.S. Code § 504.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19164"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/music-sampling-2.jpg"" alt=""music sampling"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Penalties may also include payment of a publisher’s royalty to the copyright owner, meaning the infringer will have to account to the copyright owner for a determined amount of money any time that song is sold, performed, or covered.</p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Obtaining Sample Clearance<strong> </strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the risk of liability, it is advisable to seek written permission to use the sample. In most cases, you will need to obtain written clearance from the copyright owner of the musical composition (often a music publisher), as well as from the copyright owner of the sound recording (often a record company). Most record and publishing companies will want to hear how you will use the sample before granting permission. In addition, expect everything to be up for negotiation, including the amount of music that you can use <em>and</em> how much it will cost. Typical payments include both flat fee and royalty-based licenses.</p><p>Given the significant legal issues involved, it is always advisable to <a href=""/practices/sports-and-entertainment/"">consult with an experienced intellectual property lawyer</a> who can walk you through the sample clearance process and negotiate on your behalf.</p><p><em>If you are still confused about the copyright laws involved in music sampling or would like to discuss this matter further, please contact me, <a href=""/attorneys/crystal-m-prais/"">Crystal Prais</a>.</em></p>",,20160725,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/legality-behind-music-sampling/,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/music-sampling-1.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/music-sampling-2.jpg|http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/music-sampling-1.jpeg,"music sampling 1|music sampling 2",,"Music sampling is one of the most frequent — and controversial — practices in the music industry.

The reason for this is sole proprietorships and general partnerships are not separate from a franchisee's personal legal identity.

This legal structure is most commonly used for publicly traded companies with several equity investors and executive boards. They are also troublesome for franchisees because C-corps are taxed at both the corporate and individual levels. The goal of any C-corp structure is to position a business for future growth by soliciting additional capital investment from investors. So if a franchisee anticipates rapid growth at some point, C-corps could be an ideal structure to reduce tax costs.

No federal income tax returns are filed because all profits and losses fall down to shareholders. These shareholders then report this information on their personal tax returns with a Form K-1.

19195,"What You Need to Know About Selling Your Franchise","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Here are some of the factors to consider when selling your franchise</h2>
<p>Preparing an exit strategy is a difficult aspect of owning a franchise and a decision many owners don't fully consider. According to a recent Securian Financial Group study, more than <a href=""http://www.securiannews.com/sites/securian.newshq.businesswire.com/files/research/file/SBO-1-pager-F67615-8_pod.pdf""><span class=""s2"">60 percent </span></a>of business owners do not currently have or plan to develop an exit strategy. This is an issue because every franchise owner's goal is to capitalize on the years of time and effort put into the business to build its value as an asset.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19196"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/selling-your-franchise-1.jpg"" alt=""selling your franchise"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>However, as franchise owners spend a large majority of their time running the business, it is not surprising that little attention goes to to thinking about what will happen to both the business and to them personally once they are ready to move on.<span class=""s1""><br />
 </span></p>
<h3><span class=""s1"">Exit strategies do not get enough attention</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Exit strategies are important because selling your company may account for a large share of the ROI you receive from owning the franchise. There is a stark difference between investing in the business to build its value by structuring it for optimal profit and minimal tax burdens than it is to position it to maximize its sale as an asset over time. This can be potentially damaging to the business sale value because it does not take the prospective future buyer's perspective into account.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><em>""...your exit strategy should be part of your business planning process right from the beginning...""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a business with largely transactional sales versus one focused on relational sales will have serious questions about the continuity and sustainability of the business model after the owner exits. Any question about the sustainability of future profits will drop a buyer's valuation. Other reasons that may reduce a buyer's valuation involve franchises that are too dependent on indistinguishable commodities, businesses in markets with limited potential for growth and ones that are dependent on a select few clients, to name a few.</p>
<h3>Key considerations prior to sale</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buyers want to know the demand for the products and services, the trends in the industry, the structure and complexity of the business model, personnel needs and various other aspects that could impact the bottom line in the future. Furthermore, a buyer will have a target price point for the franchise, and it may be entirely removed from what you perceived. The key is that a buyer may heavily weigh his valuation on a franchise's multiples and EBITDA. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are indicators of a franchise's financial performance, current and in the near future. Multiples, which refer specifically to the multiple of the franchise owner's benefit or adjusted net, indicate the strength and profitability of the franchise after the owner's salary and various other expenses, interest and depreciation.<span class=""s3""><a href=""/franchise-deal-411/""> The Franchise Agreement will indicate whether the approval of the franchisor is required to transfer the franchise</a>.  Other considerations include franchisee training and fees to be paid upon a transfer.  If there is a lease of office space or a store location, the terms of the lease may require landlord approval of an assignment of the lease.</span></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">Long story short, it is crucial for you to work with <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">an attorney experienced in corporate transactions</a> to gain a better idea of the types of multiples potential buyers look for based on the market demand.</span></p>
<h3>The sales process</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of the exit strategy comes when an owner receives an offer, which can be anytime. This is why franchise owners need to be prepared for an offer that may push them to sell. According to a BizQuest report, in the event of a sale, typically this acquisition process involves <a href=""http://www.bizquest.com/resource/graceful_exit_selling_your_franchise_or_business-337.html"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">12 steps for franchise owners</span></a>. These include the Letter of Intent, Purchase Agreement, due diligence of both parties, the franchisor's introduction to the buyer, Franchise Disclosure Document, the buyer's investigation, escrow process begins, Transfer Fee, New Buyer Franchise Agreement, escrow ends, new owner training and orientation and the transition process begins.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Acquisition processes can happen quickly and unexpectedly if the offer is right. To avoid a rough transition into your exit strategy, sit down with a franchise attorney to walk through a potential sale and take the steps to maximize the business valuation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19197"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/selling-your-franchise-2.jpg"" alt=""selling your franchise"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<h3>The advantages of selling a franchise</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Franchise owners have an inherent advantage over other business owners in acquisition processes because franchisors closely monitor them. These parent companies audit the franchise's performance to remove the chance of large spikes or drops in revenue and expenses. Franchisors understand exits are vital aspects of their value proposition, so they are more than willing to work with you to ensure your acquisition price and valuation are at peak value - if for no other reason than to make the franchise attractive to top prospective owners in the future. But a key aspect to remember is that franchises are in a network of other franchises - like a Dunkin Donuts franchise, for instance - which provides them with comparable valuations in similar markets.</p>
<h3>Bottom line</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most franchise owners spend 99 percent of their time running their businesses and no time planning an exit. However, what we can see is just because your business is profitable does not mean it has value - at least not what you'd expect. Many franchise owners fail to realize that by focusing solely on business growth, they could cost themselves at the negotiating table. It is crucial for owners to work with an attorney to develop a proactive transition plan years prior to sale.</p>

<p><strong>Lyndhurst, NJ – August 3, 2016 – </strong>The Scarinci Hollenbeck Environmental &amp; Land Use Law Group announced that it recently concluded a successful settlement of a New Jersey Tax Court property tax appeal with the Borough of Carlstadt, New Jersey to reduce the property tax assessment of an environmentally contaminated property undergoing environmental remediation.  The property tax assessment reductions were the following for the five tax years in contest: $943,300 reductions for tax years 2011 and 2012, $1,972,000 reductions for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and $2,220,000 reduction for tax year 2016.  The settlement also provided that the property tax assessment for future years 2017-2023 will be $100,000 until environmental remediation is completed and the property is available for development and/or occupancy prior to 2023.</p>
<p>These property tax assessments were based upon a developing body of case law in the New Jersey Tax Court which considered the effect of environmental contamination on property tax valuation, including the New Jersey Tax Court’s decisions in <a href=""http://www.saul.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/documents/19012-10opn.pdf""><u>Methode Electronics, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro</u></a>, 28 N.J. Tax 298 (Tax 2015), and <a href=""http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/tax-court/2004/00878-00-opn.html""><u>Metuchen I, LLC v. Borough of Metuchen</u></a>, 21 N.J. Tax 283 (Tax 2004).</p>
<p>“These cases provide opportunities for the owners of environmentally contaminated properties undergoing remediation to seek reductions in their property tax assessments through the filing of property tax appeals based upon the developing New Jersey Tax Court law,” said John Scagnelli, Partner and Chair of the firm’s Environmental and Land Use Group.</p>

19465,"What You Need to Know About Exclusive Use Clauses in NJ Real Estate","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Exclusive use clauses &amp; their role in New Jersey commercial real estate</h2>
<p>Exclusive use clauses are frequently found in New Jersey commercial leases, particularly standard contracts for retail space. Therefore, it is imperative for commercial tenants and landlords to understand the potential legal implications.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19469"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/exclusive-use-clauses.jpg"" alt=""exclusive use clauses"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>In basic terms, an <a href=""/practices/commercial-real-estate/"">exclusive use provision in a commercial real estate lease</a> grants a tenant the right to operate a particular use exclusively within a defined building or shopping center. For instance, a children’s clothing store may negotiate a lease provision that prohibits the landlord from renting space to another business selling children’s clothing. Depending on the terms of the provision, it would likely not prevent the landlord from leasing space to a children’s toy store or an adult clothing store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exclusive use clauses are a benefit to the tenant because they limit competition in the same retail space.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in a tenant’s market, a commercial landlord may want to offer exclusive use to secure an attractive tenant. Exclusive-use provisions can also benefit landlords where rent is based on the tenant’s profits because less competition often leads to greater sales.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How to avoid potential litigation</h3>
<p>To avoid potential litigation down the road, tenants and landlords should avoid using standard contract language. Instead, they should <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/commercial-leases-pop-quiz/"" target=""_blank"">tailor the definitions and terms to the particular circumstances of the lease</a>. Here are a few things that should be considered:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>The length and transferability of the exclusivity.</strong> For instance, what happens if the lease is assigned to an entity in another line of business? What happens if the business goes dark for a certain period of time?</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>The definition of competing use.</strong> Broad or vague exclusive use clauses are particularly hard to administer and can lead to litigation. For instance, what is the difference between a bakery that sells coffee and a coffee shop that sells baked goods?</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19470"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/exclusive-use-clauses-2.jpg"" alt=""exclusive use clauses"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>The clause should also include a clearly-defined remedy should the landlord violate the tenant's exclusive use.</strong> Common remedies include rent abatement for the duration of the competing use, and the right to terminate the lease if the competing use is not abated within a certain time period.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Each exclusive clause may also provide for some leeway as to other tenants.</strong> For instance the child clothing exclusive may allow another clothing store to display not more than “50 square feet of display area for child clothing” for sale related to its prime purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are just a few issues that should be negotiated between the parties. If you find yourself thinking of entering into a commercial lease, it is wise to consult an <a href=""/practices/commercial-real-estate/"">experienced NJ commercial real estate law attorney</a>.</p>

19474,"How the IOC's Amended Rule 40 is Benefiting Olympic Athletes","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">IOC Relaxes Rule 40 Restrictions on Non-Official Olympic Sponsors</h2>
<p>Many of the athletes competing in Rio would not be at the Olympics without the financial support provided by corporate sponsors. However, the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) strict advertising rules (specifically Rule 40) generally prohibit competitors from even tweeting about non-official sponsors, and those companies are banned from running advertisements featuring sponsored athletes during the Games.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19482"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rule-40.jpg"" alt=""rule 40"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>In response to criticism regarding the stringent advertising restrictions, particularly with regard to the impact of athletes’ rights, the IOC did relax the rules slightly in advance of the Rio Games. However, there are still a number of hoops that businesses must jump through in order to <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">avoid intellectual property infringement liability</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter</h3>
<p>Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter states: “Except as permitted by the IOC Executive Board, no competitor, coach, trainer or official who participates in the Olympic Games may allow his person, name, picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the Olympic Games.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The <a href=""http://www.teamusa.org/Athlete-Resources/Athlete-Marketing/Rule-40-Guidance"" target=""_blank"">IOC’s Rule 40 guidelines place a number of restrictions</a> on both athletes and non-Olympic commercial partners.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of example, any use of the image of a participant, taken during the Olympic Games, in combination with a company or brand, is prohibited. Olympic advertising rules also prohibit athletes from wearing branded apparel or accessories that are not part of the U.S. Team apparel issued by the USOC.</p>
<p>Under IOC guidelines, athletes may only use social media during the period of the Games for the purposes of sharing their experiences and communicating with their friends, family and supporters. Using social media for commercial and/or advertising purposes, including thanking sponsors, is expressly prohibited.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Changes Under the Relaxed Rules</h3>
<p>In 2015, the IOC amended its Rule 40 guidance to enable continuation of in-market generic advertising featuring Rio Games participants during the Games period. The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) subsequently adopted the IOC’s rule change.</p>
<p>In order to benefit from the Rule 40 changes, U.S. athletes and non-official sponsor companies were required to submit waivers to the USOC by January 27, 2016, including plans for advertising and social media campaigns. In addition, the campaigns must have been launched by March 27, 2016.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is important to highlight that official Olympic IP, such the Olympic rings, is still off-limits. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Approved campaigns may not include direct or indirect association with the Rio Games, the USOC, Team USA, Olympic IP or terms generally associated with the Olympic Games. However, for companies that sponsor well-known athletes like Michael Phelps or Simone Biles, the official logos aren’t really necessary for a successful campaign. For an example, check out Under Armor's <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/michael-phelps-returns-one-last-swim-under-armours-haunting-new-ad-170054"" target=""_blank"">""Rule Yourself"" campaign </a>with Michael Phelps and GoPro's digital video series, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJC7dqh-TY"" target=""_blank"">""Finding Missy,""</a> featuring Missy Franklin.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19483"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rule-40-2.jpg"" alt=""rule 40"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>For small businesses that did not have the opportunity to take advantage of the waiver process for the Rio Games, the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea are not that far away. In addition, there are ways to talk about the Olympics on social media without mentioning the Games by name, marketers just have to get creative (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0vhqa07b64"" target=""_blank"">check out Ford’s “We Are All Fans”</a>).

19496,"Agreement to Agree is Not Enforceable in NY","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Is this the end of agreement to agree in New York?</h2>
<p>A recent New York court decision highlights that letters of intent can often lead to messy breach of contract lawsuits - especially when it comes to the concept of agreement to agree.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19517"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/agreement-to-agree.jpg"" alt=""agreement to agree"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>As the appeals court highlighted in <em><a href=""http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2016/2016_05706.htm"" target=""_blank"">New York Military Academy v. NewOpen Group</a></em>, businesses can’t enforce the terms of a letter of intent unless both parties intended it to be a binding contract.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Letter of Intent</h3>
<p>The New York Military Academy and NewOpen Group executed a letter of intent regarding a potential joint venture and loan. The letter of intent provided that parties ""shall negotiate to arrive at mutually acceptable Definitive Agreements"" regarding the potential joint venture and loan. The letter of intent further provided that the parties ""each reserve the right to withdraw from further negotiations at any time if, in the sole judgment of either or both, it is in either Party's best interest to do so, without further liability or obligation to the other.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...it is essential that that the letter of intent is precisely written to reflect the true intent of the parties...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After negotiations broke down, the New York Military Academy filed suit, asserting causes of action alleging breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, and fraud. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. After the New York Supreme Court denied the motion, NewOpen Group appealed.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Court’s Decision</h3>
<p>The New York appeals court reversed the lower court’s decision and dismissed the <a href=""/practices/litigation/"">New York breach of contract litigation</a>. “The Supreme Court should have granted the defendants' motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint, as documentary evidence, in the form of the letter of intent, utterly refuted the plaintiff's factual allegations, thereby conclusively establishing a defense as a matter of law,” the court held.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19518"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/agreement-to-agree-2.jpg"" alt=""agreement to agree"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>In support of its decision, the court cited prior precedent holding that it is well-settled under New York common law of contracts that a mere agreement to agree, in which a material term is left for future negotiations, is unenforceable. “Here, the letter of intent demonstrated that the plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract related to a mere agreement to agree,” the appeals court explained.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Bottom Line for New York Businesses</h3>
<p>To avoid a costly legal dispute, New York businesses should <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/are-letter-agreements-binding-contracts/"" target=""_blank"">ensure that all letters of intent are properly drafted to expressly indicate</a> if certain provisions are enforceable agreements in and of themselves (such as confidentiality provisions), even if a final transaction is still under negotiation. Since it is essential that that the letter of intent is precisely written to reflect the true intent of the parties, the assistance of an <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">experienced business lawye</a>r is often advisable.</p>

19521,"What You Need to Consider When Selling Company Stock","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Filing Requirements When Selling Company Stock</h2>
<p>In many cases, start-ups and other small businesses are selling company stock without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state regulatory authority. However, the key question is whether the offering qualifies for one of several exemptions from registration under the federal <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/about/laws.shtml#secact1933"" target=""_blank"">Securities Act of 1933</a> or state laws regulating the offering and sale of securities (often referred to as blue sky laws).</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19524"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/selling-company-stock.jpg"" alt=""selling company stock"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<p>By way of example, you generally don’t need to file with securities regulators when forming your corporation and selling stock to yourself as well as co-founding shareholders. You also may not need to file with regulators when raising some initial capital from friends and family. However, it is imperative to thoroughly analyze what exemptions, if any, may apply to your particular stock sale, issuance or grant. Companies should also be mindful that federal and state laws do differ, so registration may be required by one regulator and not the other.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Rule 701 Exemption</h3>
<p>Start-ups commonly take advantage of Rule 701 under the Securities Act when making equity awards to key members of the company. Rule 701 <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.701"" target=""_blank"">exempts certain compensatory equity awards</a> issued to directors, officers, employees, trustees, service providers, etc. The key requirement is that the stock must be awarded pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or compensation contract. Accordingly, it may not be used for capital-raising transactions. Notably, Rule 701 is available to consultants and advisors, provided that they are natural persons who provide <em>bona fide</em> services to the issuer.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> Regulation D Exemption</h3>
<p>Start-ups also frequently rely on Rule 506(b) of Regulation D when awarding stock to directors and executive of officers. Regulation D is a “safe harbor,” meaning that if you comply with the rule you are considered to have engaged in an offering that is exempt from registration. Even if you fail to comply with Regulation D, that doesn’t mean that your corporation has conducted a public offering of securities that should have been registered. The issuance of shares to a founder, or even several founders, is almost always considered to be a transaction “by an issuer not involving any public offering,"" which is <a href=""/practices/securities-offerings-and-corporate-disclosure/"">an exempt securities offering</a> under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, registration under the '33 Act is not required for such sales. You don’t lose the 4(a)(2) exemption just because you did not file the Form D.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19525"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/selling-company-stock-2.jpg"" alt=""selling company stock"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Restrictions on Reselling Shares</h3>
<p>Don’t take exemptions as a license to then look for investors by offering the company stock or the stock that you received to others through the internet, a newspaper advertisement or other media without first registering that further offering. The important thing to keep in mind is that the '33 Securities Act registers offerings and the '34 Securities Exchange Act registers shares. It is a common occurrence today that an offering of shares that is exempt from registration under the '33 Act does not mean that the offering, or the resale of those shares (which constitutes a different offering), is also exempt.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Failure to Register Securities</h3>
<p>Securities transactions that are not exempt from registration and are not registered with the SEC violate Section 5 of the Securities Act. Violations may result in injunctive or other enforcement proceedings brought by the SEC, as well as private suits by securities purchasers seeking damages or rescission. In addition to costly SEC penalties, the company may also be required to make a rescission offer for all securities subject to the illegal transaction.</p>

<p>Being indicted for a white-collar crime can be financially and professionally devastating. Therefore, it is imperative to avoid any potential missteps once you discover <a href=""/what-to-do-while-under-federal-investigation/"">you may be the target of a federal investigation</a>. Responding to grand jury investigations can be particularly challenging which is why it is important to thoroughly understand grand jury immunity.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19552"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/grand-jury-immunity.jpg"" alt=""grand jury immunity"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />When a witness is called to testify before a grand jury, he or she can refuse to testify on the ground that his testimony will incriminate him. Once a witness has <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/rights-of-criminal-defendants/"" target=""_blank"">invoked his Fifth Amendment right</a>, the government attorney generally has three options: challenge the privilege and call the witness, waive his appearance, or consider a grant of immunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the witness is considered key to the investigation, he or she may be offered grand jury immunity. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immunity precludes the government from using, directly or indirectly, a witness' compelled testimony in a prosecution of that witness in any criminal case, ""except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.""</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Factors which constitute grand jury immunity</h3>
<p>In order to grant grand jury immunity, two conditions must be satisfied. First, the testimony or information sought must be in the public interest; second, the potential witness must have refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide information based on the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p>In evaluating whether an immunity order would be in the public interest, <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/206936.htm"" target=""_blank"">government attorneys are instructed to consider the following factors</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The seriousness of the offense and the importance of the case in achieving effective enforcement of the criminal laws;</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The value of the potential witness' testimony or information relevant to the investigation or prosecution;</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The likelihood of the witness promptly complying with the immunity order and providing useful testimony;</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The person's culpability relative to other possible defendants;</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The possibility of successfully prosecuting the witness without immunizing him; and</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">The possibility of adverse harm to the witness if he testifies pursuant to a compulsion order.</li>

19559,"Did You Know About the Risks of Pokémon Go?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Real and Hidden Risks of Pokémon Go</h2>
<p>As Pokémon Go exploded onto the software scene, the physical dangers of users walking into traffic, trespassing onto other people’s property, and even abandoning their children in search of the imaginary beasts caused alarm to many. However, these are just a few of the real risks of Pokèmon Go.<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19563"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/risks-of-pokemon-go.jpg"" alt=""risks of pokèmon go"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Niantic, Inc., which until recently, only enjoyed success in the niche market of augmented reality gaming, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/pokemon-go-passed-100-million-installs-over-the-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">now boasts installs surpassing 100 million and global revenue topping $160 million at the beginning of the month</a>. However, the software has begun to distress other businesses as the Pokémon Go phenomenon booms and increasingly occupies employee time while at work.</p>
<p>At a base level, Pokémon Go clearly redirects the productivity of employees who feel the mission statement of “Gotta Catch ‘Em All” eclipses that of most employers. What should be more concerning to businesses than employees’ and trespassers’ imaginary expeditions is the issue of data security.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Call to ban Pokèmon Go</h3>
<p>The International Association of IT Asset Managers (IAITAM) is <a href=""http://iaitam.org/iaitam-press-release-iaitam-pokemon-go-devices-linked-sensitive-business-data/"" target=""_blank"">calling for companies to ban the game</a> from both corporate-owned, business-only (COBO) phones/tablets and “bring your own device” (BYOD) phones/tablets with direct access to sensitive corporate information and accounts. IAITAM CEO Dr. Barbara Rembiesa warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Frankly, the truth is that Pokémon Go is a nightmare for companies that want to keep their email and cloud-based information secure. Even with the enormous popularity of this gaming app, there are just too many questions and too many risks involved for responsible corporations to allow the game to be used on corporate-owned or BYOD devices. We already have real security concerns and expect them to become much more severe in the coming weeks. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Data security concerns</h3>
<p>As highlighted above, <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">data security is a significant concern</a>. In the first version of the app, <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/11/12151442/pokemon-go-security-risk-data-information-ios-android"" target=""_blank"">the user agreement allowed Niantic to access a user’s entire Google profile</a> and essentially all metadata from the phone’s interaction with its various data signals. While the former issue has been corrected, the app still collects a large amount of data from its users, including contact lists and pinpoint locations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>While some apps are legitimate guides, others are designed to simply spread malware.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implicates an issue broader than merely the app itself. Users are increasingly downloading third-party apps that promise to help players successfully navigate the game (in other words, cheat). While some apps are legitimate guides, others are designed to simply spread malware. In addition, while the Pokémon Go fad may fade, new software applications that divert employee attention will likely appear, and the same data security concerns will arise. Therefore, a more comprehensive and active approach is needed to <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">address the increasingly dangerous and apparent world of cybersecurity</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What employers should do about potential threats to cyber security</h3>
<p>All the data an application itself collects as well as the potential for malicious third-party applications form a double-edged sword for employers. Not only is worker productivity compromised, but also, the data systems of the company might be at risk as well. The safeguards against this sort of employee behavior are not as simple as banning certain applications or other blanket restrictions that will no doubt carry unintended consequences.</p>
<p>So, rather than ban the applications as they become known to the employer, good procedures and processes that limit the transfer of information and provide for various levels of verification need to be in place so companies can operate safely, effectively, and legally.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19564"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/risks-of-pokemon-go-2.jpg"" alt=""risks of pokèmon go"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />While cyber-planning requires customization and experts, the expense and maintenance of effective cyber procedures is trivial compared to the expense and experts required for a cyber breach.</p>

19568,"A Guide on What To Do If Your Contract Partner Goes Under","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What if your Contract Partner Goes Under?</h2>
<p>While the economies of New York and New Jersey have rebounded since the 2008 recession, small businesses still face challenges. Unfortunately, when a company with which you do business closes, it may leave you seeking options so that you are not a victim of that company’s failure.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19577"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/contract-partner-goes-under-2.jpg"" alt=""what to do when your contract partner goes under"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />So what can you do if your contract partner goes under? In most cases, your legal remedies depend on the circumstances of the business closing and the terms of the underlying contract.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Best case scenario</h3>
<p>In some cases, businesses that are suffering financial trouble will be proactive and reach out to their contract partners. If the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/are-your-contract-modifications-enforceable-five-quick-tips-for-new-york-and-new-jersey-businesses/"" target=""_blank"">other party seeks to make a contract modification</a>, make sure any deal you make is memorialized in writing. If you have rights under the existing contract that you don’t want to lose, make sure the new writing protects those rights. If the business owes you money or product, state that in the writing, so that it is not a subject for later dispute – even though you may be waiving a portion of what you are owed as a compromise.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">When dealing with mergers</h3>
<p>If another firm bought the company - as in a corporate merger - usually the new company must take responsibility for the contract obligations of the former company. Many agreements specifically address “contract assignment,” in which a new party steps into the shoes of an existing party and assumes all of the obligations and rights under the contract. Some contracts may include a provision prohibiting assignment, while others may require the other party to consent to the assignment.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19584"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/contract-partner-goes-under-3.jpg"" alt=""what if your contract partner goes under?"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />If you have such rights, notify the acquiring company that you have them, and try to assert yourself into the mix in the sale, using your contract as leverage for a new direct agreement with the acquiring company. Keep in mind the politics of the situation; that is, if it appears that the acquiring company may walk away if you interfere, and the continuation of the contract relationship is not threatened by the merger, you will want to stay silent.    </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Worst case scenario</h3>
<p>If the <a href=""/practices/bankruptcy-and-creditors-rights/"">company has initiated the bankruptcy process</a>, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court may notify you as a potential claimant. Under the federal Bankruptcy Code, a debtor can often decide whether to either “assume” or “reject” certain executory contracts. There is a potential trap here with regard to payments made within 90 days of bankruptcy that may be subject to recapture as a preference over other creditors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the company has completely ceased its business operations, with no likelihood of continuing or sale, or has filed for bankruptcy protection, your ability to recover your losses is less certain.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Bankruptcy reorganization </h3>
<p>If the company reorganized in bankruptcy decides to assume the contract, it must cure all prior defaults and show that it will be able to satisfy its future obligations under the contract. If the company in bankruptcy rejects the contract, it is considered a breach and you may seek to recover damages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>However, as to claims under your contract you will likely be in line with other unsecured creditors, so it is important to review the bankruptcy filing to see your chances for a recovery in the bankruptcy.</em></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Collecting money owed</h3>
<p>If you have a contract that still is in force with a defunct company and it can’t fulfill its obligations, you may have to get the rest of your contract needs filled by another company. Then, you may have a damages claim against the company that went under. Of course, the difficulty will again be collecting any money owed.  </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Was it a corporation?</h3>
<p>If the closed business was not a corporation, you are likely to be able to bring claims against the individuals who owned the business. Remarkably, even if the closed business was a corporation, you are likely to be able to bring claims against the individual shareholders for recovery of your damages under the contract with the corporation if the shareholders dissolved the corporation and made payments to themselves or assigned or took out some corporate assets for themselves in dissolving the corporation. <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19578"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/contract-partner-goes-under.jpg"" alt=""what to do if your contract partner goes under"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />It is not uncommon for shareholders of a dissolving corporation to repay to themselves debts owed to them by the dissolved corporation for money they invested into the business.

19694,"What You Need to Know Before Re-Selling Your Franchise","<h2 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What to expect when re-selling your franchise</span></h2>
<p>In a previous post, we discussed the process of <a href=""/selling-your-franchise-411/"">selling your franchise</a>. Now, however, we will walk you through the basics of re-selling your franchise - a totally different ball game.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19695"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/re-selling-your-franchise.jpg"" alt=""re-selling your franchise"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />After you have notified the franchisor that you're considering re-selling your franchise, there are several aspects you need to take into account.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Finding a prospective buyer</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the often overlooked factors of the re-sale process for franchisees is that they do not realize that the franchisor will help them find the right buyer. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><em>There are several considerations to make when re-selling your franchise.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here are several ways in which the franchisor may assist in this process:</span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Find prospective buyers for a fee.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Use a third party sourcing firm to locate prospective buyers.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Direct you to franchise resale firms within the network to identify potential buyers.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The truth of the matter is that any franchisor will want a suitable buyer for its franchise network. Often, the franchisor will have a specific set of guidelines and procedures that outline the steps a franchisee needs to take prior to engaging in the re-sale process.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What you need to do before negotiations</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are two documents that a prospective buyer will need to review prior to any negotiations: the non-disclosure agreement and the prospectus of sale. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><em>The NDA protects the franchisee's proprietary information, while the prospectus details all necessary financial information as well as the asking price for the buyer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The prospectus information will provide an overview of the whole franchise as well as the franchisee's business. It will also cover the financial and accounting history of the business to include sales, operating costs in addition to profit and loss. The franchisee will also need to describe the property, staff members and equipment used in the location.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What you need from the prospective buyer</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In addition, the potential buyer will need to meet with representatives of the franchisor for approval of the sale. Not only will the purpose of this meeting be for approval, but typically, it will also be training for the buyer. This is especially important because if the prospective buyer does not meet qualifications through the training provided, the sale could potentially be rejected.</span><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19697"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/re-selling-your-franchise-2.jpg"" alt=""re-selling your franchise"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What you need to know during negotiations</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As soon as a price has been agreed upon, the franchisee and the prospective buyer will need to confirm the sales offer. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><em>Any legal transfer of the franchise ownership cannot be completed without proper documentation and approval from the franchisor.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At which point, a franchisee will need to <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">work with their franchise attorney</a> to navigate through the legal transfer of the business.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What you need to do before completion of the sale</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This point in the sales process is where it is essential to work with <a href=""/attorneys/anthony-r-caruso-esq/"">an attorney who specializes in franchise re-sales</a>. There will be fees, commissions and various other unforeseen expenses prior to the sale, so franchisees will need to settle these before completing the sale.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The franchisee is also required to notify all supplies and vendors in advance of the sale's completion so that the prospective buyer can establish credit with the providers. This is vital to ensure there is no business interruption following the completion of the sale.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What you need to do following completion of the sale</span></h3>
<p class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">When the funds are sent for the sales price, the franchisee effectively transfers ownership of the business to the buyer. Often, the franchisee will conduct onboarding to walk the buyer through the initial operations of the business.</span><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19696"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/re-selling-your-franchise-3.jpg"" alt=""re-selling your franchise"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /><em><span class=""s1"">These are just some of the basic steps to consider when re-selling your franchise.

19702,"Does “Made in USA” Really Mean Made in the USA?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Legality Behind Claiming ""Made in USA""</h2>
<p>During his 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump has reignited the debate about whether U.S. businesses should manufacture more products in the United States. <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19715"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/made-in-usa.jpg"" alt=""made in usa"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Of course, while criticizing companies like Apple and Ford Motor Co. for making products overseas, <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/economy/donald-trump-trade/"" target=""_blank"">Trump critics have also raised questions about whether his campaign hats and t-shirts are truly made in America</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How many US goods are actually ""Made in USA""?</h3>
<p>By way of example, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association, <a href=""https://www.wewear.org/apparelstats-2014-and-shoestats-2014-reports/"" target=""_blank"">97 percent of apparel</a> and 98 percent of footwear sold in the United States are manufactured overseas. However, consumer demand for American-made clothing and shoes has grown in recent years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Consumer demand for American-made products has grown in recent years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the demand for U.S. made high-end goods such, as guitars, basses and boutique music instrument amplifiers has increased as well. For businesses that do make their goods in this country, being able to use a “Made in USA” label can be a very successful marketing tool. However, <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">it is imperative to play by the rules</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What does ""Made in USA"" mean?</h3>
<p>Under <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-made-usa-standard"" target=""_blank"">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance</a>, ""Made in USA"" means that ""all or virtually all"" the product has been made in America. Moreover, all significant parts, processing, and labor that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. Products may not contain any — or only negligible — foreign content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In applying the “all or virtually all” standard, the FTC will analyze a number of different factors...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In applying the “all or virtually all” standard, the FTC will analyze a number of different factors, including the proportion of the product’s total manufacturing costs attributable to U.S. parts and processing, how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product, and the importance of the foreign content or processing to the overall function of the product.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What if you can't meet the ""Made in USA"" standard?</h3>
<p>For businesses that can't satisfy the standard, it is possible to include a qualified “Made in USA” claim, which describes the extent, amount or type of a product’s domestic content or processing and indicates that the product isn’t entirely of domestic origin. Examples include: ""70% U.S. content,"" or ""Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts or assembled in the USA using domestic and foreign parts.""</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Be mindful when you claim ""Made in USA""</h3>
<p>In any event, it is imperative for businesses to thoroughly analyze the percentage of domestic content in a particular product before making a “Made in USA” claim. Under the FTC Act, the FTC is authorized to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims, including those that misstate a product is of U.S. origin.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19716"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/made-in-usa-2.jpg"" alt=""made in usa 2"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />In 2015, the FTC staff sent 28 “closing letters” to businesses that were investigated by the agency and subsequently agreed to alter their labeling and advertising to comply with federal law. To date, the FTC has sent 18 letters in 2016, which suggests the agency’s radar screen is quite active.</p>

19720,"Unseen Dangers: What You Should Know About Election Cyber Security","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Election Cyber Security: The Lay of the Land</h2>
<p>This November's election cycle is shaping up to be the most tumultuous in recent history. With a public already on edge, it must confront another, possibly more significant problem, greater than the polarization of political views in this country. The issue at hand is the security and integrity of the vote, or in other words, election cyber security.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19722"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/election-cyber-security.jpg"" alt=""election cyber security"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Although our government tends to lag behind private enterprise in the adoption of new technologies, government at all levels has generally embraced the promise of computers and the internet as a means of reducing transaction time and cost. However, just as private enterprise is waking up to the threat posed by cyber-criminals, Americans are waking up to the possibility that politics can be disrupted through unwanted and, sometimes even foreign interference.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Democratic National Committee’s Servers Hacked</h3>
<p>Earlier this summer, it became apparent that <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/us/politics/russian-hackers-dnc-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FDemocratic%20National%20Committee"" target=""_blank"">The Democratic National Committee’s servers had been hacked</a> and its documents stolen. The fall-out from the publication of those documents was swift. Just before the Democratic National Convention began, the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/dnc-wikileaks-emails/"" target=""_blank"">DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz was forced to resign</a> and effectively given no role in the convention. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was also hacked, presumably by the same person or group.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The documents leaked from the DCCC exposed its private political calculations and assessments as well as information on its donors.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just recently, news circulated that the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/politics/hackers-breach-illinois-arizona-election-systems/"" target=""_blank"">election systems in Illinois and Arizona were hacked</a>, with voter information accessed and copied.</p>
<p>Further aggravating the situation is that these hacks do not seem to be merely the whims of precocious and unruly teenagers, as most would like to imagine, but, rather, are <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/27/politics/dnc-hacking-emails-russia-white-house/"" target=""_blank"">the work of Russian state-sponsored actions</a>. The danger of such foreign meddling cannot be overstated. If the FBI announces the day after the November elections, that the process had been <a href=""/practices/cyber-security-and-data-protection/"">affected by a data breach</a> or data editing making the vote unverifiable, the trust in our electoral system will surely be thrust into doubt.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Foreign Entity Cyber Threat</h3>
<p>The most extreme case notwithstanding, is that the election can also be swayed by more subtle means. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Without even needing to directly tamper with the vote, a foreign government can selectively release documents to the American public that would damage a political career of a politician opposed to that government.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, hackers might modify some data to make certain documents and emails appear more negative to the public, or hackers could insert fabricated documents into a leak of otherwise authentic documents.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19723"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/election-cyber-security-2.jpg"" alt=""election cyber security"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />The potential for sowing doubt and confusion into a country by hacking its politically sensitive systems is enormous and must be treated as a grave threat to our government. Due to both the complexity and newness of computerized systems and their vulnerabilities, it is difficult to grasp what is happening and its consequences. Moreover, the ability to penetrate systems anonymously and remotely makes legal enforcement extremely difficult.</p>

<p>This can pose a challenge due to the fact <a href=""https://www.luxurydaily.com/how-can-retailers-recondition-consumers-mobile-price-comparison-shopping-habits/"" target=""_blank"">that consumers now conduct price comparisons in real-time through their mobile devices</a> - even while in a brick and mortar store. This can have a significant impact on a small business. The purpose of MAP agreements is to prevent a customer from finding a lower advertised price and effectively stop them from being lured away to another brick and mortar store or make the purchase online.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What exactly are MAP agreements?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://sellerengine.com/map-agreements/"" target=""_blank"">MAP agreements set the lowest price that a retailer can <em>advertise</em> for a product.</a> This is very different than setting a minimum <em>selling</em> price, which is illegal. This may not be as simple as it sounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MAP agreements set the lowest price that a retailer can <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">advertise</span> for a product.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, for an online purchase, the consumer needs to be told the price at some point before the purchase. Further, MAP agreements may put restrictions on advertising rebates, coupons, discounts and other methods that reduce the cost.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Bottom line on MAP agreements</h3>
<p>MAP agreements can be either detrimental or positive for both retailers and suppliers. Retailers need to know what is acceptable under the MAP agreement before deciding on marketing efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MAP agreements can be either detrimental or positive for both retailers and suppliers. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppliers and manufacturers need to be sure their MAP policies do not run fowl in terms of price fixing and do not put too many restrictions on the retailers as to make selling the product more trouble than it is worth.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19730"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/map-agreements.jpg"" alt=""map agreements"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />When done correctly, MAP agreements level the playing field for all retailers of a product and protect the supplier or manufacturer from advertising that is detrimental to the reputation of their products.</p>

19743,"Bitcoin and the Blockchain: What is Cryptocurrency?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency is such a new technology that not much is known about it. In fact, most people who have some familiarity with it only have a rough understanding of bitcoin, which is just one form of cryptocurrency.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19745"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cryptocurrency-2.jpg"" alt=""cryptocurrency"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />In the eyes of many, the technology still resides in the dark web — <a href=""https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cryptocurrency/"" target=""_blank"">a currency that has no function other than to evade government enforcement</a> and to transact illegal purchases of drugs, prostitutes, and guns. Nonetheless, the promise of cryptocurrency extends far beyond the internet underground.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What about the US dollar?</h3>
<p>Presently, the US Dollar is backed by the abstract idea of “<a href=""https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/4000-2660.html"" target=""_blank"">the full faith and credit of the United States.</a>” At one time, it was backed by gold. However, for a number of reasons, this system proved to be ill-equipped to support a more globalized economy. Therefore, the U.S. government pinned the value of the dollar based on the trust that people hold in the U.S. economy. This step away from the gold standard to a faith-based currency was seen as groundbreaking.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The effect of cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency, if perfected, would not just be groundbreaking, but a paradigm shift on how we exchange value—and possibly the greatest shift since the invention of metal coins. It requires no government oversight, which essentially means that there is no governmental entity that will back up the value of the currency or support a holder’s right to gold or any other commodity.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What's the value of cryptocurrency?</h3>
<p>The purchasing power of a bitcoin, for example, is inextricably linked to how much value the “market” for bitcoins ascribes to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...the market of bitcoins, comprised of willing buyers and willing sellers, sets the value of the bitcoin...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the market of bitcoins, comprised of <a href=""https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/affects-bitcoin-price/"" target=""_blank"">willing buyers and willing sellers, sets the value of the bitcoin</a> based on nothing more than how much the sellers want in bitcoins for a good or service, and how much buyers are willing to pay.</p>
<p>This is different then the traditional currency exchange markets, where for example, the value of the U.S. Dollar fluctuates with the underlying health of the U.S. economy, as well as in response to the decisions made by the Federal Reserve. The value of cryptocurrency, however, exists entirely in the aggregate of individual buyers and sellers.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why the bitcoin market is strong</h3>
<p>The entirety of bitcoins are not yet all in circulation, as they need to be “mined”—a concept too esoteric for this series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bitcoin’s programming is fixed so that only 21 million bitcoins can ever exist.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means, however, is that since there is a cap on the number of bitcoins, they can be traded in fractionalized amounts. Moreover, there can be no inflation through a deliberate flooding of the market.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What does the future hold for cryptocurrency?</h3>
<p>As cryptocurrencies advance in the marketplace, it is still difficult to see whether they will replace or compliment government-backed currencies, or if governments will begin to back their own forms of cryptocurrencies. However, what is not in doubt is that as with the advents of previous technologies, the exchange of value is moving more and more toward complete abstraction.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19747"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cryptocurrency.jpg"" alt=""cryptocurrency"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />In the next post, we will discuss <a href=""https://markets.blockchain.info/"" target=""_blank"">the technology that is the cornerstone of all cryptocurrencies</a>—the Blockchain—and how it is more likely the true revolution.</p>

<p>A small claims court for resolving smaller copyright infringement claims could finally come to fruition thanks to a proposed bill for the CASE act. But what is the CASE act and how could it affect you?<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19762"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CASE-act.jpg"" alt=""CASE act"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />After being informally debated over the past several years, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5757/BILLS-114hr5757ih.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a bill was introduced in Congress</a> last month that would establish a new Copyright Claims Board known as the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act, or CASE act for short.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why the CASE act was introduced</h3>
<p>Filing a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor, particularly for small businesses and individual copyright holders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...filing a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor...</em></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is the CASE act?</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5757/BILLS-114hr5757ih.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2016</a> (CASE Act) would establish a Copyright Claims Board comprised of three officers with significant experience resolving copyright claims. The members of the tribunal would be recommended by the Register of Copyrights and appointed by the Librarian of Congress.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Key Provisions of the CASE act</h3>
<p>Below are several other key provisions of the proposal:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> Proceedings could be initiated by a copyright holder claiming infringement or by a user seeking to obtain a legal declaration of non-infringement. The small claims court would also be authorized to hear claims for misrepresentation in connection with a notification of claimed infringement or a counter notification seeking to replace removed or disabled material under Section 512(f) of the <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Limited Damages:</strong> Awards of statutory damages would be limited to $15,000 for each work infringed, provided the <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">works were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office</a> prior to infringement or within three months of publication. For works that were not timely registered, the damages would be limited to $7,500 per work. The monetary damages in any one proceeding would be capped at $30,000.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19763"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CASE-act-2.jpg"" alt=""CASE act"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Attorneys’ Fees:</strong> Except in the case of bad faith conduct, the parties to proceedings before the Copyright Claims Board would bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Electronic Proceedings: </strong>Claims before the board would not require in-person appearances by parties or others. Instead, they would take place by means of written submissions, hearings and conferences accomplished via Internet-based applications and other telecommunications facilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Potential repercussions of the CASE Act</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The upside of the CASE Act is that <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">copyright infringement claims would proceed more quickly</a> and be less costly to litigate.

19768,"NJ Court Rules EPA Notice Letter Triggers Coverage","<p>Ruling on an issue of first impression in New Jersey, a New Jersey court has held in <a href=""http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/decisions/Cooper%20LLC-L-9284-11%208.30.16.pdf"" target=""_blank""><em>Cooper Industries LLC v. Employers Insurance of Wausau A Mutual Co. et al</em></a>. that receiving a General Notice Letter from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) can trigger coverage under a commercial general liability insurance policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The EPA’s General Notice Letter</strong></p>
<p>On March 10, 2010, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter to Cooper Industries LLC, naming Cooper as a “potentially responsible party” (PRP) for pollution remediation of a 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River known as the Lower Passaic River Restoration Project. In the General Notice Letter, the EPA maintained that Cooper was responsible for the cleanup as the successor to the McGraw-Edison Company.</p>
<p>The agency also requested that Cooper become a cooperating party by participating in a Cooperating Parties Group Agreement (CPG Agreement), which is a type of settlement between and among the EPA and other potentially responsible parties. The EPA warned that if Cooper declined to join the cooperating group, the EPA “may apply the CERCLA enforcement process, pursuant to Section 106(a) and 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. §9606(a) and §9607(a) and other laws.”</p>
<p><strong>The Insurance Coverage Dispute</strong></p>
<p>In May 2011, Cooper notified OneBeacon Insurance Company, whom Cooper contends issued policies to Cooper’s predecessor, McGraw-Edison, of the EPA General Notice Letter and demanded that OneBeacon provide Cooper with a defense to the EPA action. OneBeacon refused to provide a defense to Cooper. As a result, Cooper assumed its own defense and entered into the CPG Agreement. The company subsequently filed a declaratory action against OneBeacon and its other insurance carriers seeking indemnification in connection with the EPA action. Cooper maintains that, as a result of OneBeacon’s failure to provide Cooper with a defense, it has incurred (and is continuing to incur) more than $4.1 million in defense costs. Among other arguments raised, OneBeacon contends that its duty to defend has not been triggered because the EPA’s notice letter to Cooper is not a “suit,” as the term “suit” plainly means some type of court proceeding.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Court’s Decision</strong></p>
<p>The court held that the General Notice letter did constitute a suit, triggering OneBeacon’s duty to defend Cooper. In reaching his decision, Judge Garry J. Furnari noted that many other jurisdictions have adopted the same position. Judge Furnari also highlighted the fact that the EPA relies on Notice Letters to encourage cooperation, subjecting those who fail to comply to contempt proceedings, fines, and treble damages and barring them from filing a contribution action against settling PRPs. ""[G]iven the coercive nature of CERCLA, it would be 'naive to characterize the EPA letter as a request for voluntary action,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>“Had Cooper failed to take action, and instead waited for the EPA to file a lawsuit, it would have been subject to strict joint and several liability and other potential damages under CERCLA,"" Judge Furnari further explained. “While the reasonableness of Cooper’s settlement with the CPG may very well be at issue later in this case, there is no question that a policy in favor of triggering coverage before a formal complaint is filed serves to enhance the important functions of the Statute. To hold otherwise would discourage prompt and cooperative remediation efforts and the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites.”</p>
<p>Given Judge Furnari’s decision, insureds who receive a CERCLA General Notice letter from the EPA should immediately notify their carriers and contact their attorneys in order to secure coverage for related costs.</p>",,20160921,post,http://scarincihollenbeck.com/?p=19768,,,,,,,"Firm Insights>Environmental &amp; Land Use","EPA|EPA General Notice Letter|firm insights|Scarinci Hollenbeck",draft,62,,,,0,0,closed,open
19770,"Tips for International Trademark Protection","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Need to Know About International Trademark Protection</h2>
<p>Given our increasingly global economy, even small businesses should consider international trademark protection. Failing to protect your brand when conducting business overseas can lead to costly legal disputes.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19779"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/international-trademark-protection.jpg"" alt=""international trademark protection"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />When a business <a href=""/practices/intellectual-property/"">registers a trademark</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (<a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/"" target=""_blank"">USPTO</a>), the legal rights are limited to the United States. Thankfully, it is becoming easier to extend trademark rights to other countries around the world.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Proactively Protect Your Marks</h3>
<p>Defensive registration is extremely important with respect to trademarks, particularly because many countries give priority to the first to file. Under “first to file” systems, trademark rights are generally bestowed on the first entity to file an application. With this in mind, there is incentive for brand counterfeiters and hijackers to pursue trademark rights ahead of U.S. companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>""When a business registers a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the legal rights are limited to the United States.""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In countries like China, for example, major brands have been forced to buy back a registration, which can be extremely expensive and time consuming. Given the potential legal headaches, businesses should identify key international markets and then begin the process of obtaining trademark protection as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Do Your Research</h3>
<p>Once your business has identified the key markets where trademark protection is needed, it’s time to do some research. To start, it is imperative to verify that another entity is not already using an identical or confusingly similar mark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>""Businesses should be sure to assess how well their brand names and slogans will translate into other languages.""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some cases, a perfectly acceptable English term or image <a href=""http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5241-international-marketing-fails.html"" target=""_blank"">may be vulgar or otherwise offensive in another language</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> Consider a One-Stop Solution</h3>
<p>The Madrid system makes it possible to register a mark in several territories through one procedure. The system is <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/"" target=""_blank"">administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)</a> and governed by two international treaties, the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For trademark owners, the <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/trademark/laws-regulations/madrid-protocol"" target=""_blank"">Madrid system provides several key advantages</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It allows trademark owners to file one single application to secure trademark protection in more than 100 different countries. Accordingly, it also avoids the need to comply with different national procedural rules, translate applications, retain local agents, and pay several different fees. Upon receipt of the trademark application, WIPO notifies all of the Madrid Protocol countries in which registration is sought. If the member country fails to object within twelve to eighteen months of being notified, the trademark is registered.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Renewing Your Trademark</h3>
<p>Renewal is also more manageable under the Madrid system. The required fees need only be paid every 10 years to the International Bureau of WIPO rather than several national trademark offices. Additionally, if the international registration is assigned to a third party or a change in name and/or address occurs, it only needs to be recorded once with the WIPO.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What to Look Out For</h3>
<p>While the Madrid system offers many advantages, trademark owners utilizing the Madrid Protocol must be cognizant of their trademark rights. The rights granted by an international registration can be extinguished if the home national application in which the international registration is based on does not mature to registration if the international registration’s home national registration is cancelled during its first five years.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19780"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/international-trademark-protection-2.jpg"" alt=""international trademark protection"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />This concept is called a “central attack.” If either of these situations were to occur, trademark owners may opt to transform an international registration into national applications in each of the contracting parties in which the international registration had effect, which would allow for the preservation of the priority date of the international registration.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Assembly Bill No 1914</h3>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What impact could Assembly Bill 1914 have?</h3>
<p>The proposed changes to the construction code would impact the construction of many multiple dwelling structures built in New Jersey. The legislation specifically addresses structures built with lightweight wood frame construction (Type V) and equipped with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 13R sprinkler systems, which allow for the omission of sprinklers in certain areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The proposed changes to the construction code would impact the construction of many multiple dwelling structures built in New Jersey.</em></p>

<p>The bill also amends provisions of the New Jersey construction code that allow for the construction of buildings on top of structures such as parking garages, which effectively allow the buildings to be built higher than otherwise allowed. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Requirements under Assembly Bill 1914</h3>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, whenever an automatic sprinkler system is installed in accordance with NFPA 13R in a building comprised, in whole or in part, of lightweight wood frame construction:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Unprotected and unheated wood-framed attic areas must be protected by a dry type sprinkler system; and</li>

<p>Ruling on an issue of first impression in New Jersey, a New Jersey court has held in <em><a href=""http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/decisions/Cooper%20LLC-L-9284-11%208.30.16.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cooper Industries LLC v.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The EPA Notice Letter</h3>
<p>On March 10, 2010, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter to Cooper Industries LLC, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/finding-potentially-responsible-parties-prp"" target=""_blank"">naming Cooper as a “potentially responsible party”</a> (PRP) for pollution remediation of a 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River known as the Lower Passaic River Restoration Project. In the General Notice Letter, the EPA maintained that Cooper was responsible for the cleanup as the successor to the McGraw-Edison Company.</p>
<p>The agency also requested that Cooper become a cooperating party by participating in a Cooperating Parties Group Agreement (CPG Agreement), which is a type of settlement between and among the EPA and other potentially responsible parties. The EPA warned that if Cooper declined to join the cooperating group, the EPA “may apply the CERCLA enforcement process, pursuant to Section 106(a) and 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. §9606(a) and §9607(a) and other laws.”</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Insurance Coverage Dispute</h3>
<p>In May 2011, Cooper notified <a href=""http://www.onebeacon.com/"" target=""_blank"">OneBeacon Insurance Company</a>, whom Cooper contends issued policies to Cooper’s predecessor, McGraw-Edison, of the EPA General Notice Letter and demanded that OneBeacon provide Cooper with a defense to the EPA action. OneBeacon refused to provide a defense to Cooper. As a result, Cooper assumed its own defense and entered into the CPG Agreement.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19800"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EPA-Notice-Letter.jpg"" alt=""epa notice letter 2"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />The company subsequently filed a declaratory action against OneBeacon and its other insurance carriers seeking indemnification in connection with the EPA action. Cooper maintains that, as a result of OneBeacon’s failure to provide Cooper with a defense, it has incurred (and is continuing to incur) more than $4.1 million in defense costs. Among other arguments raised, OneBeacon contends that its duty to defend has not been triggered because the EPA’s notice letter to Cooper is not a “suit,” as the term “suit” plainly means some type of court proceeding.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> The Court’s Decision</h3>
<p>The court held that the General Notice letter did constitute a suit, triggering OneBeacon’s duty to defend Cooper. In reaching his decision, Judge Garry J. Furnari noted that many other jurisdictions have adopted the same position. Judge Furnari also highlighted the fact that the EPA relies on Notice Letters to encourage cooperation, subjecting those who fail to comply to contempt proceedings, fines, and treble damages and barring them from filing a contribution action against settling PRPs. ""[G]iven the coercive nature of CERCLA, it would be naive to characterize the EPA letter as a request for voluntary action,"" he wrote.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19801"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/epa-notice-letter-3.jpg"" alt=""epa notice letter 3"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />“Had Cooper failed to take action, and instead waited for the EPA to file a lawsuit, it would have been subject to strict joint and several liability and other potential damages under CERCLA,"" Judge Furnari further explained. “While the reasonableness of Cooper’s settlement with the CPG may very well be at issue later in this case, there is no question that a policy in favor of triggering coverage before a formal complaint is filed serves to enhance the important functions of the Statute. To hold otherwise would discourage prompt and cooperative remediation efforts and the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites.”</p>
<p>Given Judge Furnari’s decision, insureds who receive a CERCLA General Notice letter from the EPA should immediately notify their carriers and <a href=""/practices/environmental-and-land-use/"">contact their attorneys in order to secure coverage for related costs</a>.</p>

19806,"Tips to Consider Before Investing in a Start-Up","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Should Consider Before Investing in a Start-up</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">While the economy is steadily improving,<a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190"" target=""_blank""> 75 percent of all start-ups will fail</a>, often in the first year. Before jumping “all in"" and investing in a start-up, investors must be sure to carefully evaluate the business opportunity to determine whether the potential return on investment (<a href=""http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/technical-analysis/return-investment-roi-1100"" target=""_blank"">ROI</a>) outweighs the risks.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19810"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/investing-in-a-start-up-2.jpg"" alt=""investing in a start-up"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Things to consider before investing in a start-up</p>
<p>Below are a few key due diligence tips to consider before investing in a start-up business.</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Stick with What You Know</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It can be tempting to dive into a “hot” industry. However, investors are generally more successful when they focus on industries in which they have firsthand experience. While investors certainly don’t need to be experts, possessing a general knowledge of the market can help evaluate a start-up’s business plan, products and services, executive team, potential for growth, and potential competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>...investors are generally more successful when they focus on industries in which they have firsthand experience...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is not within your experience, get the opinion of an experienced adviser whom you trust. You want an unbiased, and even skeptical, analysis - one that provides insightful questions to assist you in your decision-making process.</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Pick the Right People</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A start-up is only as good as the managers behind it. While every start-up needs a great product or service, it is also imperative to extensively vet the leadership team. Whether it’s performing an Internet search, interviewing prior business partners, or conducting a professional background search, it is important to verify that the management team has the knowledge, experience, and skills to not only run the company successfully, but also steer its growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>A start-up is only as good as the managers behind it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The investing maxim is: “I prefer to invest in a company with grade A management and grade B product rather than grade A product and grade B management.” Of course, one prefers top notch on both accounts.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19811"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/investing-in-a-start-up-3.jpg"" alt=""investing in a start-up"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Fill a Market Void</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The products and services offered by the start-up company must fill a void in the market or otherwise have something novel to offer the public. In its business plan, the <a href=""http://www.businesslawnews.com/trying-to-get-your-new-york-or-new-jersey-business-off-the-ground-your-business-plan-could-be-holding-you-back/"" target=""_blank"">start-up should be able to demonstrate what steps it has taken so far</a> to research the market, develop the product or service, and outline what remains to be done, and a projection of the time and money needed to get there. The company should also be able to demonstrate that it has a leg up on the competition, i.e. whether its product/service is better or whether it will make it to market first.</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Crunch the Numbers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Investors should receive detailed information showing the start-up’s financial condition, with projections of costs and revenues. The business should provide a current balance sheet, profit and loss statements, tax returns, audited financial statements (if feasible), and accounts payable and receivable. Investors should also ask for an accounting of all the start-up’s non-tangible assets, particularly intellectual property.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19812"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/investing-in-a-start-up.jpg"" alt=""investing in a start-up"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /></p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>It’s All About Timing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What is management’s proposed end-game? Knowing how to get in and how and when to get out are key to start-up investment decisions. To make the most of your investment, it is advisable to select a start-up that has a <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">viable plan for cashing you out on your investment</a> – unless the plan is to create a pure and continuing revenue generator, especially one with ongoing tax benefits (for example, oil and gas or real estate investments) – in short, a “cash cow.” </p>
<p>Management should be able to tell you how your illiquid investment in their start-up company will bear fruit: going public, getting acquired by a large company in the industry, or, if the investment includes a combination of debt and equity, convertible debt, or preferred stock with liquidation preferences, how that is intended to be repaid.</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Preference For a Track Record, Even Prior Failure </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Management with a prior history of start-up efforts, even if unsuccessful (see Steve Jobs, for example) can prove helpful in overcoming the normal growing pains of a young business. People often learn from failure better than a prior success that came easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>People often learn from failure better than a prior success that came easy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even a prior mixed success may have been filled with helpful lessons, with management learning of traps to avoid, how not to make bad hires and cash and time management tricks necessary for a growing company to master. The most frequent error causing an early demise of an otherwise good business idea: undercapitalization.</p>

19826,"Money Market Funds Shake Up","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">New Rules enacted by the SEC Poised to Shake Up Money Market Funds</h2>
<p>Big changes are in store for the $2.7 trillion money market funds industry.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19828"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Money-Market-Funds-2.jpg"" alt=""money market funds"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Rules enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href=""https://www.sec.gov/"" target=""_blank"">SEC</a>) are slated to take effect on October 14, 2016, and could lead to market volatility.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">SEC’s Money Market Reform Rules</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679"" target=""_blank"">new SEC money market rules</a> require institutional money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value (<a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp"" target=""_blank"">NAV</a>) for sales and redemptions based on the current market value of the securities in their portfolios. Traditionally, funds have maintained a constant $1 share price.</p>
<p>The SEC enacted the rules in response to the 2008 financial crisis, specifically when <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122160102128644897"" target=""_blank"">Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck”</a> (the net asset value of the fund fell below $1) due to heavy losses brought on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers. After a flood of redemption requests, the government was forced to step in to stabilize the money market industry. The SEC passed the new rules in 2014, but gave the industry two years to come into compliance.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">More on the new SEC rules</h3>
<p>The new SEC rules also provide non-government money market fund boards with new tools to address a run on the fund. The new tools – fees and gates – authorize fund boards to impose liquidity fees or to suspend redemptions temporarily (also known as “gate”) if a fund’s level of weekly liquid assets falls below a certain threshold.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19831"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/money-market-funds-3.jpg"" alt=""money market funds"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Specifically, if a money market fund’s level of “weekly liquid assets” falls below 30 percent of its total assets, the money market fund’s board can impose a liquidity fee of up to two percent on all redemptions. In addition, if a money market fund’s level of weekly liquid assets dips below 30 percent, a money market fund’s board could in its discretion temporarily suspend redemptions.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact of New Money Market Rules on Investors</h3>
<p>Government money-market funds (defined as any money market fund that invests 99.5% or more of its total assets in cash, governmental securities and/or repurchase agreements which are collateralized solely by government securities or cash) can still seek to maintain a $1 share price after SEC rules take effect, and they will not be subject to redemption fees or redemption gates. As a result, many money market funds have already transitioned to government funds, prompting government fund assets to exceed institutional funds for the first time ever this past May.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, money market funds have been required to disclose their per-share net asset values based on market prices, and there has been little fluctuation from $1. However, under the new rules, significant market changes, such as a change in interest rate by the Federal Reserve, could trigger investor losses.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19830"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Money-Market-Funds.jpg"" alt=""money market funds"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Investors should also <a href=""/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/"">be aware of other potential changes resulting from the new fees and gates</a>. As highlighted above, investments could be locked up during times of extreme market stress. However, it is also important to note that funds cannot suspend redemptions for more than 10 business days within any 90-day period.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of New Jersey recently held that a subcontractor’s faulty workmanship is covered under a developer’s commercial general liability policies (CGL). <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19843"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Commercial-General-Liability-Policies-2.jpg"" alt=""commercial general liability policies"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />The decision in <em><a href=""https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A131415CvA.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cypress Point Condominium Association v. Adria Towers</a></em> provides much-needed clarity regarding one of the <a href=""/practices/insurance-recovery-liability/"">most common types of insurance disputes</a> involving construction defects.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Facts of the Case</h3>
<p>The insurance dispute centered on the construction of Cypress Point, a luxury condominium complex in Hoboken. Co. Defendants Adria Towers, LLC, Metro Homes, LLC, and Commerce Construction Management, LLC (collectively, the developer) served as the project’s developer and general contractor, and subcontractors carried out most of the work. During construction, the developer obtained four general liability policies from Evanston Insurance Company and three from Crum &amp; Forster Specialty Insurance Company .</p>
<p>After the complex was completed, several residents began experiencing problems, such as roof leaks and water infiltration around windows in units and common areas. Plaintiff Cypress Point Condominium Association sued the developer and several subcontractors, alleging faulty workmanship during construction and claiming various consequential damages. The central question in the lawsuit was <a href=""/practices/insurance-recovery-liability/"">whether the Association’s claims were covered by the insurers’ general liability CGL policies</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Commercial General Liability Policies</h3>
<p>The policies were all modeled after the 1986 version of the standard form CGL policy promulgated by the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO). They provided coverage for “those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ . . . caused by an ‘occurrence’ that takes place in the ‘coverage territory’ . . . [and] . . . occurs during the policy period.”<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19844"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Commercial-General-Liability-Policies.jpg"" alt=""commercial general liability policies"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />Under the policies, “property damage” was defined to include “[p]hysical injury to tangible property including all resulting loss of use of that property.” Meanwhile, an “occurrence” was defined as “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” The policies also contained an exclusion, for “Damage to Your Work” (the “your work” exclusion), which eliminated coverage for “‘[p]roperty damage’ to ‘your work’ arising out of it or any part of it and included in the ‘products-completed operations hazard.’” Notably, the exclusion stated it “does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on [the insured’s] behalf by a subcontractor.”</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong> </strong>The Court’s Decision</h3>
<p>The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the CGL carriers must provide coverage. ""The consequential damage caused by the subcontractors' faulty workmanship constitutes 'property damage' and the event resulting in the damage ... is an 'occurrence' under the plain language of the commercial general liability policies at issue here,"" Justice Lee Solomon wrote.</p>
<p>In reaching its decision, the court noted that the seminal New Jersey insurance cases addressing whether construction defects are covered under CGL policies construed the 1973 ISO standard form CGL policy and not the 1986 version. It also highlighted that courts across the country have held that faulty workmanship constitutes an “occurrence” based on the exception to the “Your Work” exclusion in the 1986 version.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19845"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Commercial-General-Liability-Policies-3.jpg"" alt=""commercial general liability policies"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />The New Jersey Supreme Court followed the trend in holding that the post-construction consequential damages, which resulted in loss of use of the affected areas by residents, were covered “property damage” under the terms of the policies. As Justice Solomon explained, “because the result of the subcontractors’ faulty workmanship – consequential water damage to the completed and non-defective portions of Cypress Point – was an “accident,” it is an “occurrence” under the policies and is provided an initial grant of coverage.”</p>
<p>The court next turned to the relevant exclusions under the policies, as well as their exceptions. It concluded that while the 1986 “your work” provision eliminated some coverage for water damage to the completed sections of Cypress Point, “an exception to this exclusion, which was added to the 1986 ISO standard form CGL policy, narrowed the exclusion by expressly declaring that it does not apply if the damaged work or work out of which the damage arises was performed by a subcontractor.”</p>

19856,"Will I Know If I Am Under Investigation for a White-Collar Crime?","<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Should Know About White-Collar Crime Investigations</h2>
<p>We've previously discussed <a href=""/what-to-do-while-under-federal-investigation/"">what to do while under federal investigation</a>, however, now we will delve into how you can know whether or not you're under investigation for a white-collar crime.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19857"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/White-Collar-Crime-3.jpg"" alt=""white-collar crime"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />One of the unique aspects of white-collar crime is that the suspect is often aware that he or she is under investigation before being charged with a crime. In many cases, the prosecutor will use a grand jury to investigate and gather information.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Signs You May Be the Target of a White-Collar Crime Investigation</h3>
<p>If one or more of the following federal agencies has contacted you, you may be the target of a white-collar crime investigation:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Federal Bureau of Investigation</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">Securities and Exchange Commission</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Signs to Look Out For</h3>
<p>In addition to being contacted by one of the agencies listed above, you may be the target of a grand jury investigation if you experience one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">You are contacted by an agent of a similar state agency.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">You receive a grand jury subpoena to produce business records.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">You are presented with a search warrant to seize business documents.</li>
	<li style=""padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px;"">You learn from third parties that they have been served with subpoenas or been interviewed by a state or federal agency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What to Do If You Receive a Target Letter</h3>
<p>In most cases, subjects of a white-collar investigation will receive a target letter informing them that they are under investigation by a grand jury. Federal prosecutors are not required to issue target letters, but it is the general policy of the Department of Justice to do so. Cases where notification may not be provided include routine clear cases or cases where such action might jeopardize the investigation because of the likelihood of flight, the risk for destruction of evidence, or similar concerns.</p>
<p>In a target letter, the United States Attorney's office <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-160-sample-target-letter"" target=""_blank"">informs the recipient that he or she is the target of a federal investigation</a> and will be called to testify in front of a grand jury. The letter broadly states nature of the illegal activity being investigated and advises the target of his or her rights, including the <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/rights-of-criminal-defendants/"" target=""_blank"">Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination</a>. The letter also warns the recipient that the destruction or alteration of any document required to be produced before the grand jury is a violation of federal law.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19859"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/White-Collar-Crime.jpg"" alt=""white-collar crime"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />It is imperative to <a href=""/attorneys/robert-e-levy/"">contact an experienced white-collar defense lawyer</a> as soon you suspect you may be the target of an investigation and certainly before meeting with state or federal law enforcement agents. We have seen many cases where the defendant damaged his or her case by saying or doing something in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases, an attorney may be able to prevent criminal charges from ever being filed.</p>

19863,"Why Are Songwriters Suing the Department of Justice?","<h2 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">Songwriters are suing the Department of Justice over licensing rights</span></h2>
<p>Earlier this month, the Songwriters of North America<span class=""s2""> (<a href=""http://wearesona.com/"" target=""_blank"">SONA</a>)</span><span class=""s1"">, a grassroots group of 200 songwriters in the U.S., <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/media/songwriters-sue-justice-department-over-licensing-rules.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">filed a federal lawsuit</span></a> against the Department of Justice, <i>The New York Times </i>reported. Apparently, SONA is suing the DOJ over licensing rights.</span><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19865"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/suing-the-Department-of-Justice-3.jpg"" alt=""suing the department of justice"" width=""550"" height=""257"" /><span class=""s1"">The lawsuit also named Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata B. Hesse as defendants, since they head the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.</span></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why are they suing the Department of Justice?</h3>
<p>SONA claimed in the two-count suit that the DOJ-Antitrust Division new rule on 100 percent music licensing <a href=""http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/14/songwriters-sue-feds-over-new-licensing-rule.htm"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">violates the Administrative Procedure Act</span></a>, according to <i>Courthouse News</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>The lawsuit claims that songwriters will lose control over licensing rights.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The songwriters are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the decision, arguing that it also <a href=""http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-05/"" target=""_blank"">infringes on Fifth Amendment rights</a> because it allows for the removal of property rights without due process.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The details of the lawsuit</h3>
<p>The basis for SONA's lawsuit is that the Justice Department's decision asserted power beyond its authority and violated songwriter property rights, copyright interests and contract freedom. Specifically, The <i>NY Times</i> explained that the decision could void existing contracts between collaborators on a song. This means that regardless of one co-writer's involvement in creating the song, he or she could fully license the song on his/her own without consent from the other collaborators.</p>
<p>From a broader perspective, SONA also argued the government has no place in regulating the music industry or its marketplace. A separate <i>NY Times</i> report showed that as a result, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/media/justice-department-wont-alter-music-industry-royalty-rules.html"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">songwriters have less control</span></a> over the way their music is licensed or how they negotiate their royalty agreements.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19866"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/suing-the-Department-of-Justice-2.jpg"" alt=""suing the department of justice"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />The lawsuit also contended that most songs which are successful on the commercial music marketplace have co-writers who belong to separate performance rights organizations such as <a href=""http://www.ascap.com/"" target=""_blank"">ASCAP</a> and <a href=""http://www.bmi.com/"" target=""_blank"">BMI</a>. <i>Billboard</i> reported that, with collaborators having complete ability to license a song while belonging to different performance rights organizations, this could <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7510213/songwriter-sue-department-of-justice"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">adversely impact the way songwriters can license</span></a> their music in the marketplace.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">Third party and foreign involvement</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another key aspect of the suit is that foreign songwriters and those composers who do not belong to ASCAP or BMI will not have the right to license their collaborative works through the organizations. SONA argued that these are rights granted to songwriters <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/title17/"" target=""_blank"">under the Copyright Act</a>.</span></p>
<p>Under the new rule, songwriters may have to license songs outside the PRO system, give up control of their copyrights and royalties to unaffiliated third parties, renegotiate each song's contract, and consider withdrawing songs from ASCAP or BMI altogether, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Department of Justice's decision</h3>
<p>This decision came two years after an initial plea and proposal from ASCAP and BMI to the Justice Department to modify its licensing consent decree. Sony/ ATV and BMG, among other major music publishers, had lobbied to amend the decree, so that they could withdraw from the standard regulation licenses offered under ASCAP and BMI.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Then the agency decided in late June, 2016, not to modify its consent decree on song licensing processes at all. Instead they decided to rule further to enforce 100% licensing by BMI and ASCAP, striking down the theory that each rights holder can license only that individual’s share of a song. <i>Billboard</i> reported that this leads to ASCAP / BMI no longer being allowed to engage in fractionalized licensing, and any rights holder has the right to license an entire song to a user.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As a result, the Justice Department follow up with an <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-completes-review-ascap-and-bmi-consent-decrees-proposing-no-modifications"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">announcement in August</span></a></span><span class=""s3"">, 2016</span> <span class=""s1"">which stated that songwriters in licensing agreements may need to renegotiate their contracts.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">What will happen after the lawsuit?</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">SONA is not alone in its pursuit of litigation and regulation reform against the Department of Justice. In an interview with <i>Billboard</i>, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia explained that he is set to introduce a <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7510213/songwriter-sue-department-of-justice"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">new bill to amend music licensing rights</span></a>.</span></p>
<p>""The decision will only make it harder for songwriters who are already being harmed by government overregulation in this space,"" Collins argued. ""Under current law, songwriters are being paid pennies on the dollar for their creative works, particularly when it comes to streaming. That's why I've introduced the Songwriter Equity Act to ensure that fair market value is taken into account when rates are set.""<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-19867"" src=""http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/suing-the-Department-of-Justice.jpg"" alt=""suing the department of justice"" width=""550"" height=""257"" />In addition to Rep. Collins' bill, <i>Courthouse News</i> also reported that ASCAP will lobby Congress for new legislation. BMI has already brought an action against the agency in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. It was victorious in that action on September 16, 2016 with the U.S. District Cout stating that the consent decree does not demand or require full-work licensing.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While it remains to be seen exactly what the ramifications of SONA's lawsuit and any litigation or legislation to follow will bring to the licensing rights, it is clear that the entire music industry wants to see changes made. This problem has become much more complex with the impact that online streaming music outlets have had on licensing rights and royalty compensation for songwriters.</span></p>
