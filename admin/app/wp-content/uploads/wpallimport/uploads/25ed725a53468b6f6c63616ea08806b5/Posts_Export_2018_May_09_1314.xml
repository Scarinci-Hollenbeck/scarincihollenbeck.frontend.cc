		<content><![CDATA[I received an interesting discussion of New York’s Statutory Residence Rule in the Tax Analysts Special Report dated April 4, 2011. <a href="http://www.mwe.com/info/pubs/Faber0404.pdf">The article written by Peter L. Faber</a> criticizes the statutory residence test and argues that it should be repealed. In his article, the author points out that New York State taxes residents on all their world wide income, regardless of whether it has any connection to New York. A person who is not legally domiciled in New York is treated as a resident for income tax purposes if he maintains a permanent place of abode in New York and is present in the state for more than 183 days during the tax year. This individual is known as a “statutory resident.” The statutory residence rule only applies for personal income taxes. In the article, the author points out that the statutory residence test was conceived as an objective surrogate for the domicile test. It was intended to avoid the complex inquiry that goes into determining a person’s domicile and to ensure that a person who really lived in New York could not avoid resident status by arguing that his “state of mind” placed primary loyalty elsewhere.

During the month of October is the time to make a loan to you child (assuming that the child is not subject to the "kiddie tax."  Why? Because the imputed interest rate for October is at an all time low and therefore as a planning tool you can move wealth to your children gift and estate tax free.

Generally loans between related parties are governed by the IRS code so that related parties cannot assign income without adverse tax consequences. There is a small exclusion between related parties so that a loan of $10,000 generally does not require that interest be charged.

In some cases if a loan of $100,000 or less is made between related parties there is no imputed interest to the lender so long as the borrow does not earn more than $1,000 from investments. If the borrower earns a greater amount then the lender can be charged with interest income.

Because of the current extremely low interest rate environment making a loan to a child can avoid the imputed interest charge and shift wealth to the borrower.

Let's assume that a loan is made to your child $1 million. The loan will require that you use the current applicable rate for a short term loan- 0.16%.a short term loan is a loan with a term of less than three years, Assuming further that the child pays the interest rate due annually of $1,600. After three years a child will pay $4,800.

Now assume that the child invests the $1 million in a market investment returning 4%. At the end of three years the return on the investment will be $120,000. The difference will be $115,200. Now couple this with annual gifts to the child of the current annual exclusion of $13,000 which for two parents is $26,000, the net benefit (and wealth shift) to the child over the three years is $423,600! At the end of the loan period the parent will receive back his or her $1,000,000 plus the earned interest.

This is simple illustration underscores the advantage of making a low interest loan to a child using the current low interest rates.

This technique when applied to several children can pass wealth at no tax cost (gift or income) to the parents. If the borrower were a trust for the benefit of the child, the net benefit earned on the investment and by way of annual, gift can be protected from creditors and be available for the child during his/her lifetime.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Unlike the Federal Tax Treatment of Bad Debts,
New Jersey Taxpayers Are Not Entitled to a Bad Debt Deduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The New Jersey Appellate Division in <em>Waksal v. Director, Division Of Taxation</em> determined that a New Jersey couple<em> </em>could not report losses to offset capital gains on their New Jersey income tax return.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In January 2002, Harlan W. Waksal loaned $14,769,320 to his brother, who signed a promissory note and agreed to repay the loan on or before January 31, 2004. His brother then defaulted on the loan. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a 2004 Federal Individual Income Tax Return and reported a short term capital loss of $14,769,320. They also filed a 2004 New Jersey Gross Income Tax Return and reported the same amount as a loss from the "sale, exchange or other disposition of property," pursuant to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c). After using the loss to offset capital gains, they reported $6,644,022 as a net gain in their New Jersey tax return.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The New Jersey Appellate Court affirmed the summary judgment granted to the Director, Division of Taxation. The Waksals argue primarily that their nonbusiness bad debt was "a sale, exchange or other disposition of property" under N.J.S.A. 54A:5-1(c), and, as a result, they are allowed to report the loss on their New Jersey Gross Income Tax Return and offset capital gains. Because the <a title="New Jersey Gross Income Tax" href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/git.shtml" target="_blank">New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act </a>(the Act), N.J.S.A. 54A:1-1 to -10, does not permit such a deduction, the trial court’s decision was affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The trial court relied in part on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Walsh v. Director, Division of Taxation" href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-supreme-court/1385952.html" target="_blank">Walsh v. Director, Division of Taxation</a></span>, 15 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J. Tax</span> 180 (App. Div. 1995), and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="King v. Director, Division of Taxation" href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-superior-court-appellate-division/1296123.html" target="_blank">King v. Director, Division of Taxation</a></span>, 22 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.</span> Tax 627 (App. Div. 2005), which held that a loss from a nonbusiness bad debt could not be used to offset gains "derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property" under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c). The trial judge indicated that "net gains or income from disposition of property" is considered taxable income under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c), which provides in part that New Jersey gross income consists of certain categories, including:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Net gains or net income, less net losses, derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of property, including real or personal, whether tangible or intangible as determined in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The judge reasoned that the Act "does not mirror federal taxing statutes" and observed that the Supreme Court explained in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Smith v. Director, Division of Taxation</span>, 108 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.</span> 19, 32 (1987), that:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even a cursory comparison of the New Jersey Gross Income Tax and the Internal Revenue Code indicate [sic] that they are fundamentally disparate statutes. The federal income tax model was rejected by the Legislature in favor of a gross income tax to avoid the loopholes available under the Code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The court recognized that in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Walsh</span> the Legislature determined that the New Jersey Gross Income Tax should contain fewer deductions from income than the federal income tax. This was seen as a way of making the Gross Income Tax fairer. The Legislature did not explicitly provide for a deduction of a nonbusiness bad debt. Thus, in view of the legislative history, it would appear that the Legislature did not intend for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1c to be read broadly to include a deduction for nonbusiness bad debts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the decision of the judge conflicts with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c) and the Supreme Court's clear direction to apply substantive federal tax rules to determine net gains and loses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Walsh</span>, the taxpayers sought to deduct a nonbusiness bad debt following a personal loan to a corporation in which they were also shareholders. The corporation then transferred its assets to a second corporation, "but [the taxpayers] remained liable as . . . guarantor[s] on the bank loans." After the second corporation defaulted on the bank loans that the taxpayers guaranteed, the taxpayers paid off the debt and deducted the losses on their New Jersey Gross Income Tax return.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quoting the Tax Court, the Appellate Court held that the worthless debt, although treated as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for not more than one year . . . under the Internal Revenue Code, does not fit the statutory rubric of sale, exchange or other disposition of property" found in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because Waksal's loss from their nonbusiness bad debt cannot be used to offset gains derived from the "sale, exchange or other disposition of property" under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N.J.S.A.</span> 54A:5-1(c), the judge  concluded that plaintiffs could not report the loss to offset capital gains on their New Jersey income tax return.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The IRS has ruled that after 2009 when an employer provides an employee with a cell phone primarily for non-compensatory business reasons, IRS will treat the employee's use of cell phone for reasons related to employer's trade or business as working condition fringe benefit, the value of which is excludable from employee's income. Notice 2011-72.
<p style="text-align: left;">The notice provides guidance on the tax treatment of cellular telephones or other similar telecommunications equipment (“cell phones”) that employers provide to their employees primarily for noncompensatory business purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Section 2043 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Pub.L.No. 111-240, (the Act) removed cell phones from the definition of listed property for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009. The notice addresses the treatment of employer-provided cell phones as an excludible fringe benefit. A fringe benefit provided by an employer to an employee is presumed to be income to the employee unless it is specifically excluded from gross income by another section of the Code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Act removed cell phones from the definition of listed property for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009. Because the Act removed cell phones from the definition of listed property, the heightened substantiation requirements that would otherwise apply to listed property no longer apply to cell phones for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many employers provide their employees with cell phones primarily for noncompensatory business reasons. The value of the business use of an employer-provided cell phone is excludable from an employee's income as a working condition fringe to the extent that, if the employee paid for the use of the cell phone themselves, such payment would be allowable as a deduction under section 162 for the employee.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An employer will be considered to have provided an employee with a cell phone primarily for noncompensatory business purposes if there are substantial reasons relating to the employer's business, other than providing compensation to the employee, for providing the employee with a cell phone. For example, (i) the employer's need to contact the employee at all times for work-related emergencies, (ii) the employer's requirement that the employee be available to speak with clients at times when the employee is away from the office, and (iii) the employee's need to speak with clients located in other time zones at times outside of the employee's normal work day are possible substantial noncompensatory business reasons. A cell phone provided to promote the morale or good will of an employee, to attract a prospective employee or as a means of furnishing additional compensation to an employee is not provided primarily for noncompensatory business purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The notice provides that, when an employer provides an employee with a cell phone primarily for noncompensatory business reasons, the IRS will treat the employee's use of the cell phone for reasons related to the employer's trade or business as a working condition fringe benefit, the value of which is excludable from the employee's income and, the substantiation requirements that the employee would have to otherwise meet in order for a deduction under § 162 to be allowable are deemed to be satisfied.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, the IRS will treat the value of any personal use of a cell phone provided by the employer primarily for noncompensatory business purposes as excludable from the employee's income as a <em>de minimis</em> fringe benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This notice applies to any use of an employer-provided cell phone occurring after December 31, 2009.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In a recent letter to H&amp;R Block, the IRS informed a senior tax adviser that opposite-sex parties to an Illinois civil union should be treated as husband and wife for federal income tax purposes if they are treated as husband and wife by Illinois, adding that under those circumstances, the parties may file their federal return as married filing jointly.

<span style="color: #000000;">The informal guidance appears to say that an Illinois civil union constitutes a marriage for federal tax purposes -- a position that will come as a surprise to practitioners. While registered domestic partnerships (RDPs) and civil unions are used by same-sex and opposite-sex couples to receive the state law benefits of marriage, they are distinct from state law marriages. In this Letter, the IRS remarked:</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In general, the status of individuals of the opposite sex living in a relationship that the state would treat as husband and wife is, for federal income tax purposes, that of husband and wife. Section 20 of the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act provides that “[A] party to a civil union is entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections and benefits as are afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses . . .” 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 75/20 (2011). Accordingly, if Illinois treats the parties to an Illinois civil union who are of opposite sex as husband and wife, they are considered “husband and wife” for purposes of Section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code, and are not precluded from filing jointly, unless prohibited by other exceptions under the Code.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Opposite-sex couples who aren't married for state law purposes generally can't file joint federal tax returns. According to Publication 501, </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information</em></span><span style="color: #000000;">, state law governs whether a couple is married, and only married couples may file joint returns. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The IRS must follow the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and defines a spouse as a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife. It would appear for that reason, even if a state recognizes a same-sex couple as married, that couple can't claim married filing jointly status on a federal return. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Whether this Letter is an aberration or a trend will remain to be seen. The constitutionality of DOMA is being litigated nationwide. If DOMA is found to be unconstitutional or repealed, same sex couples who are recognized as married by a state may be permitted to file joint federal tax returns.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Tax Relief Act of 2010 made significant changes to the gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax regimes by increasing the amount each individual can give without incurring tax from $1 million to $5 million.  The increase was not permanent however, and rumor has it that it may be in jeopardy.  To avoid any risk, those who have decided to use their full exemptions should do so no later than December 31, 2011, and, if feasible, November 22.
<h2>The Rumors</h2>
Rumors circulating recently within the financial and estate-planning communities have suggested the $5 million exemptions may be in immediate jeopardy.  Democratic staff on the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means recently proposed decreasing the $5 million gift, generation-skipping transfer tax and estate tax exemptions to $3.5 million, effective January 1, 2012.  There also are rumors the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Super Committee) may recommend a drop down in the gift tax exemption to $1 million, effective at year end, or possibly as early as November 23, 2011, when its recommendations are scheduled to be released, though there is no confirmation this rumor is true.

As we all know "everything" is on the table before the super-committee (although they would not admit it), I would caution you to advise your clients of these developments and act sooner rather than later.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2> Estate of Liljestrand T.C. Memo 2011-259 (November 14, 2011): IRS wins case where “bad facts” all but guaranteed a taxpayer defeat.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sunday-015-200x300.jpg" alt="Estate of Liljestrand T.C. Memo 2011-259 (November 14, 2011): IRS wins case where “bad facts” all but guaranteed a taxpayer defeat." />The taxpayer failed to properly implement the basic steps that would support the validity of the partnership. Taxpayer’s revocable living trust owned sizable investments in commercial real estate. A limited partnership was formed with the taxpayer taking back preferred (Class A) and  non-preferred (Class B) interests. Taxpayer formed the entity in April, yet did not open bank accounts until August, 1999. Notwithstanding gifts were made in 1997 and 1998. The taxpayer obtained an appraisal; however, the net equity of the taxpayer’s contribution of real estate subject to mortgage debt did not match the value of the interests reported as gifts. The taxpayer assigned its own values to the Classes A and B, then sought to rely upon the appraisal at trial.

It is imperative that a taxpayer respect the business form he or she has chosen. In the instant matter, the taxpayer (and his son) ran the business exactly as they had before the limited partnership was formed. If the form were respected, the general partner should exert some authority to manage the affairs of the limited partnership cognizant of fiduciary duties owed to all partners. The failure to establish the bank account resulted in the co-mingling of personal and business funds in the same account. Suppose the taxpayer were faced with a judgment or tax lien. A creditor would be better able to set aside the transfer and collect upon the judgment because of the failure to respect form.

The IRS travels the shortest road to victory when taxpayers co-mingle funds, whether in income tax or estate tax cases. Another factor contributing to the taxpayer loss was the substantial disproportionate distributions to taxpayer, ignoring the calculated preferred return on Class A units.  Taxpayer used the limited partnership funds to make gifts to grandchildren and pay personal expenses.  The limited partnerships failed to maintain capital accounts, which are an elementary feature of any tax partnership.
<h2>What lessons can we learn from this case?</h2>
There must be a business purposes supporting the formation of the entity. Defeating the estate tax should not be the stated purpose. A taxpayer and his advisors would do well to read <strong><a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/turner3.TCM.WPD.pdf" target="_blank">Turner</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/bongard.TC.WPD.pdf" target="_blank">Bongard</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/Harper5.TCM.WPD.pdf" target="_blank">Harper</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13664896949851966811&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Harrison</a></strong>, and  <strong><a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/inophistoric/stonecold.tcm.wpd.pdf" target="_blank">Stone</a></strong>. In Lifjestrand, there was the potential argument that, upon the taxpayer’s death, the other limited partners, taxpayer’s other three children, would sue for partition under state law. The argument was not well developed or thought out and was refuted by the government. Cleary, a careful analysis of state law should be made if this is to be the reason for forming the entity.

The successful partnership cases have had proportionate or pro rata contributions by all partners. Here there were no contributions by the other limited partners. Thus, any suggestion that the partners were diversifying individual risk by pooling capital and spreading risk across more assets or broader classes of assets falls apart.

The business reasons for forming the entity should be tailored to the family’s circumstances. It does no good to mention professional or centralized management if there is no discernable difference if operating procedures before formation and after are the same. If you are seeking to create a new generation of managers, they had better participate in a meaningful way.

The taxpayer must not have an express or implied understanding that the taxpayer is to enjoy the property or have a right to income that would negate the transfer. Treas. Reg. § 20.2036 -1(a). Stated simply, the taxpayer must understand that he or she does not own the property in the same way as before. Here, the taxpayer transferred most of his assets (99%)  and had to rely on the disproportionate distributions to maintain his life style. In Mirowski, the taxpayer retained $7.5 million is securities, an amount sufficient to support her lifestyle based upon the income from the portfolio and analysis of cash-flow needs.

Delays in funding the partnership create problems. Aside from indicating  a lack of respect on the part of the taxpayer for the form of the transaction, appraisals that become stale, raise valuation issues on audit that must be refuted.
<div>

I always ask the taxpayer-client the following question:  Name the owner of the property transferred? The answer tells me if the client has been listening.

		<content><![CDATA[In a recent New Jersey Tax Court memorandum case [Dalton V. Director of Division of Taxation (Doc. No. 020540-2010), the Division of Taxation was ordered to refund income taxes paid on dividend and capital gain reported as earned income in 2006-2008.  The taxpayer was a Madoff victim and was subsequently caught between the differences between two systems of taxation, although the underpinning of the NJ gross income tax is federal.

The IRS tackled this issue by setting forth a global procedure (Rev. Rul 2009-9, 2009-14 (IRB 735) to deal with the deductibility of losses and classified as theft losses. The Taxpayer has the option to deduct 95% of the loss if he or she did try to obtain it, and 75% if he or she did (Rev. Proc. 2009-20). The opinion recites that the taxpayer took advantage of the procedure, but did not request refunds for returns of capital and tax-exempt income.  Most readers recognize that the federal system requires a taxpayer to recognize income constructively received, such as interest added to a savings account, but not withdrawn.

<strong>SO WHAT?</strong>

<strong> </strong>New Jersey’s Gross Income Tax (“GIT”) differs from the federal income tax in several ways, and it this lack of symmetry that often causes unexpected results that often surprise taxpayers. In the Madoff-type cases, New Jersey demanded that the losses be deducted as investment losses because the GIT statutes do not have a provision for theft losses. However, the court disposed of that argument by noting the inconsistency of the Director’s position, which characterized the losses from theft, not investment. The opinion pointed out a weakness in the position of  the Director that there weren’t any assets--much less investment assets--and that “stolen” does not mean “sold”. The Court ended up stating that the taxpayer would be in a position of having paid tax on income erroneously reported.

There are two issues that annoy taxpayers.  First, the absence of a theft category in New Jersey’s Gross Income Tax produces some abnormalities because there is always a question as to what parts of the federal system have to do with the GIT.  Second, the GIT has categories of income that cannot be used against gains in another. Thus, the results of a federal tax analysis do not always translate to the GIT.

<strong>IS IT COMPLICATED ENOUGH YET?</strong>

Consider other disconnects between the two systems.  Depreciation deductions are not always identical, which also produces a disparity between the tax basis used to calculate gain on sales. Corporation losses are another source of taxpayer torment, where the inability to use the losses on a state basis theoretically creates the same disparity. Ultimately, when a corporation’s Certified Public Accountant does not do the individual return for each corporation shareholder, the analysis of a transaction may produce disparate results, much to the surprise—and dismay—of the shareholder group.

The congressional Super Committee’s failure to complete its prime directive on coming up with a consensus on how to cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion over a ten year period has wide ranging consequences on every American.  The “super” failure will trigger automatic spending cuts for many years and has yielded both winners and losers.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
</span></strong>

<strong>WHO ARE THE SUPER WINNERS?</strong>

<em>Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare recipients</em> who may have seen a reduction in healthcare and pension benefits. The committee was considering reforms in the big three entitlements to reduce the government's burden of providing benefits to an aging population.

<em>The pharmaceutical industry</em>. Democrats wanted to give government more power to regulate the price of prescription drug costs for Medicare. One suggested compromise would have reimbursed drug companies at the lower Medicaid price for those individuals who are eligible for both the Medicare health program for the elderly and the Medicaid health program for the poor.

<em>Hedge fund managers</em>. Hedge fund and private equity managers pay a 15% capital gains rate on most of their annual earnings instead the 35 percent ordinary income tax rate.  This “carried interest” tax loophole will continue.

<em>Owners of second homes, corporate jets and yachts</em>. Committee members were considering limiting the mortgage interest deduction for second homes and yachts. The committee was also looking at closing an existing tax loophole for corporate jets.

<em>Wealthy individuals and Estates</em>. The committee members were considering the reduction of the Estate Tax and Gift Tax Exemptions from $5,000,000 down to $1,000,000.

<em>Charities</em>. The committee considered capping write-offs on charities as a percentage of each filer’s gross income.

&nbsp;

<strong>AND THE SUPER LOSER AWARDS GO TO…</strong>

<em>Department of Defense and Homeland security</em>. The committee's failure triggers a massive $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts to start in January 2013. $600 billion of those cuts will come out of the defense budget.

<em>Medicare providers</em>. The automatic cuts to Medicare fall on hospitals and other healthcare providers, although cuts to healthcare providers could have been even deeper if the committee had succeeded.

<em>Federal food, safety, and the environmental protection agencies,</em> along with a number of other domestic programs that will see their budgets cut under the automatic spending cuts.

<em>People that rely on food stamps, housing, education and heating assistance</em>. These programs could be slashed by the across-the-board spending cuts.

<em>The American people</em>. The U.S. debt, standing at around $15 trillion, has nearly tripled over the last decade.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The stalemate has not resulted in a nightmare for everyone, but is sure evidence that Washington is not ready to overcome partisan politics to deal with the record deficit.

		<content><![CDATA[Tax Advisors have often heard this question from taxpayer-clients:  “What do you mean I cannot take the loss?” What followed was a discussion that has been characterized as a cure for insomnia. Tough economic times produce losses, but the rules have not always permitted business entities to use them. Given your mix of active and passive activities, it may be possible to make a more efficient use of losses by a careful selection of an appropriate state law and by amending documents to include or exclude management activities so as to achieve active or passive status.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-278 alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/11/4016256174_9c245e1e34-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />

Many years ago, the passive loss rules--passive loss meaning a loss incurred through a business entity, but not an individual--were put into place that would deny taxpayers the use of losses against other types of income. These rules, along with at-risk (IRC §465) and partnership’s substantial economic effect, were imposed to put an end to the tax shelter industry. Losses from activities in which the taxpayer did not participate in a material way were classified as “passive” and could not be used to offset income from salary, dividends or non-passive activities (e,g, Schedule C active consulting business or professional practice). The objective was to extinguish shelters and the rules extinguished a lot more.

One old definition was that income from a limited partnership interest was automatically passive unless one satisfied certain exceptions. Still another old rule held that where one was both a general and limited partner, the limited partnership interest would not be treated as passive.  This rule was designed to keep active business interests from converting some part of the income to passive and thereby offset losses. The rules did not keep pace with changes contained in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Limited_Partnership_Act">Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act</a> adopted in many states, which permits limited partners to have more say in management without losing their liability shield.

What about a membership interest in a limited liability company?  The old rules characterized the membership interest as a limited partnership interest, and thus passive. The new rules, reflecting the outcome of court cases, focus on the member’s ability to participate in management.

What you should do now.  Consult with your advisor on how the new rules may better enable you to utilize your losses. Perhaps, more importantly, these changes will encourage capital to be deployed in new investments and thus stimulate our morbid economy.  Being able to use losses rather than carry them over, reduces the overall cost of capital.  Any increase in business activity would be welcome.]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My colleague, an accountant, was crying the other day in a small corner near our coffee room. I asked him what prompted this surprising and lowly state. He mentioned that one of his clients, John Doe, has a business structure that includes over 20 attributed limited liability companies ("LLC's"). My colleague was frustrated because the business structure has activities interlinked between all of the companies. From an accountant's perspective, picture Alice staring down the rabbit hole of tax wonderland (or nightmares).</p>
Typically, the classic business structure had one master company that owns other entities, all operating and functioning independently. Each one of these sub-businesses are able to own their own separate "LLC" beneath the Master LLC. This is what John Doe has done, and consequently why my colleague has recently been filling his coffee cup with tears.
<h3>Delaware Has a Plan</h3>
Later that night, I started to think about the issue. I asked myself,  "SELF! Would a Series limited liability company ("Series LLC") solve all of my colleague's turmoil? It was then that I remembered how Delaware has been handling this issue. Delaware has led the way and provided a very flexible statute that allows taxpayers to make one or more Series LLC's. Moreover, they allowed our friends offshore the ability to make segregated cells, in which the assets of one series are protected from the claims and liabilities of another series. Delaware requires a certificate to show that the assets of one series are separate from the other.

What Delaware does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> require is a title to a particular property to be placed in the name of a particular series, opting instead to allow the property to be held by the LLC, a particular series or be attributed to a nominee of the series. Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6,§ 18-215(b) (2005 &amp; Supp.2010). Why is this beneficial? It streamlines the ability to establish and separate property ownership (land), property development, construction, sales, and management without having to re-title the land. How does this apply to reality? Real estate development, for example, will be much easier without having to jump through hoops by re-titling, likewise with a cosmetic company working on its research and development, its product lines and sales force.

I came the next day to bring the good news to my colleague, but then I remembered he mentioned (in passing) that his client was based out of New Jersey. In all of my excitement to find a solution, I must have forgotten! As I went back to the drawing board, I was slightly disheartened by the fact that my colleague's tears would have to continue another day.

		<content><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Part 2 of 2: Would a New Jersey Court Accept a "Series LLC?" </strong></h3>
I went back to the drawing board later that night to find out how New Jersey is handling the situation. Would a New Jersey court accept a Series LLC? New Jersey has not adopted a series limited liability company statute, so the answer is not entirely clear, although it is not uncommon for New Jersey courts to apply Delaware's state of formation law to corporate, partnership and limited liability company issues. I told my colleague this information the next day, and a little twinkle in his eye started to show. There was hope for his accounting nightmare yet.

<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/5928525663_708922e03b_m-1.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><!--[endif]-->

There are other questions that can arise from the formation of a Series LLC. For example, could a series file for bankruptcy? It is arguable that a Series LLC is a separate person, and therefore can file for bankruptcy apart from another series. If the classification of a series is separate from another, some suggest that this distinction is enough to file. Currently, courts are ordering interest held by one debtor in a normal LLC to be used to satisfy a judgment. Would this be the same case for a Series LLC? This question proved a very difficult one, so I decided to send an email to my <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/">other colleague</a>, who is referred by everyone at the office as "the bankruptcy guru". I will be sure to let everyone know what he finds out about this Series LLC issue.

When it comes down to the management of each separate series, there are no set answers. This allows a lot of flexibility for those who are using this method, but also poses some difficulties, distinguishing the number of issues to consider being among them. It makes sense to use a Series LLC structure when there are fewer interests or members to consider.

As far as the tax classification of the series, regulations do not rely on state law and make the determination on whether series are separate entities by using federal principles. Regulations require that underlying state statutes must give the members rights, powers or duties with respect to the series. The series must have separate rights, powers or duties, with respect to property or obligations. The assets and liabilities of a series must be separated from another series...

The conclusion seems to be that the IRS will treat a Series LLC as a separate legal entity as long as it does not lack a business purpose or activity, other than tax avoidance (naturally).]]></content>

The corporate veil is a term often used to describe the separate entity that exists when businesses set up a corporation or a limited liability company (think of it as a new person that is added to the company). Often there have been cases where the creators of these entities use the "veil" created as means to significant personal gain, without any of the liability attached to themselves personally. By applying the proper procedures for piercing the corporate veil, the abusers of these entities are then held accountable for the actions of the entity itself.

		<content><![CDATA[Yesterday, the IRS released its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-12-01.pdf">2012 Standard Mileage Rates</a></span>.

<a href="get-your-motor-runnin-irs-standard-mileage-rates" rel="attachment wp-att-364"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/5447158429_06c5f66c0e_m.jpg" width="192" height="134" /></a>The New Rates:
<ul>
<li>The standard mileage rate for transportation or travel expenses is <strong>55.5 cents per mile</strong> for all miles of business use (business standard mileage rate).</li>
<li>The standard mileage rate is <strong>14 cents per mile</strong> for use of an automobile in rendering gratuitous services to a charitable organization under § 170.</li>
<li>The standard mileage rate is <strong>23 cents per mile</strong> for use of an automobile (1) for medical care described in § 213, or (2) as part of a move for which the expenses are deductible under § 217.</li>
</ul>
The Standard Mileage Rates serve as a simple guideline for employers to reimburse employees who use their personal vehicle for work-related purposes. However, the IRS does not mandate that businesses reimburse their employees for vehicle use and a business may opt to reimburse at a rate much lower than that set Standard Mileage Rate. Companies may deduct these reimbursements as business expenses on tax returns. While the IRS certainly allows a business taxpayer to calculate and deduct the <strong>actual</strong> cost of using a vehicle, the use of the IRS Standard Mileage Rates (or a lower rate) simplifies the process and eliminates the need for extensive documentation to substantiate the deduction.

The other day I wrote a two-part blog entitled "Knowing the ABC's of Your 'Series LLC's.'"   This described my quest to decipher some of the complications inherent in dealing with "LLC's" (Limited Liability Companies), and with "Series LLC's" (Series Limited Liability Companies).  In doing this, I raised some difficult questions:

1.  Could a Series, LLC file for bankruptcy?  Could a Series, which is part of a Series, LLC file?

2.  Could the assets of one Series be used to satisfy a judgment of another Series?  Of the Series, LLC?

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

These questions proved difficult, so I decided to send an email to my <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/" target="_blank">other colleague</a>, who is referred by everyone in my office as "the bankruptcy guru".  Strolling into my office today, I found a letter under my door -- the work of "the bankruptcy guru."  It touches on the questions that I asked:

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><em>Dear Sir,</em>

<em></em><em>The answer to your several questions depends on whether the particular judge--bankruptcy court or civil--would consider that a Series LLC and its various Series entities are separate legal persons, or simply one entity. For example, Bankruptcy Code §§109(a, d) restrict Chapters 7 and 11 to “persons”, who are defined at §101(41) to include “individuals”, “corporations”, and “partnerships”. “Corporations” are defined at §101(9) to include “associations”, “partnership associations,” “joint-stock companies,” “unincorporated companies or associations” and “business trusts.”</em></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This would seem, at first blush, diverse enough to include a Series LLC as a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code. It is, however, unclear if the separate Series within a Series LLC could themselves be separate bankruptcy debtors, or if they might instead have their assets and liabilities consolidated into the bankruptcy of the Series LLC. As stated, the answer would depend upon whether the Series would be considered separate legal “persons” under the Bankruptcy Code.  The case law on this point is minimal, so far, although it is sure to develop.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>One final point: Even where entities are considered separate legal persons, federal law provides for “substantive consolidation” of their assets and liabilities in certain cases.  As noted in In re Owens Corning, 419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir. 2005), substantive consolidation can be justified where the movant shows that the entities disregarded their separateness so significantly that their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders, or that the entities caused their assets and liabilities to be so scrambled that separating them is prohibitive and hurts all creditors.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><em>Hope This Helps,</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: right;" align="right"><em>Your Bankruptcy Guru</em></p>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<div>

		<content><![CDATA[<img class="size-medium wp-image-395 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/5769907534_72f0d639ac-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" />Forrest Gump was a wise man for coining the phrase "Stuff Happens" (according to the G-Rated version of the movie). People--whether investors or business owners--often have different aspirations that many times do not necessarily coincide with the project they were undertaking. A simple case is when one owner/investor is more anxious to move on with the next "project", as opposed to managing the project at hand to ensure its security. This post will introduce some of the complications of "exit consequences", or when parties decide to leave a a project, and the messy aftermath that often follows.

One instance of this messy endeavor is when an estate has received its closing letter to distribute assets to its beneficiaries. Among the assets to be distributed are membership interests in a limited liability company (“LLC”) or limited partnership interests in a limited partnership (“LP”). The LP and LLC may have served their intended purposes by allowing losses to be utilized, subjecting income to only one level of tax or obtaining discounts for lack of marketability and for a minority stake that reduced estate tax. However, investment philosophy and risk tolerances may reasonably differ. Liabilities may consume cash flow, increasing the tension between those able to hold for the long term and those needing immediate cash for other reasons. Basically, if someone values their family ties, they may not want to be partners with their siblings.

Income tax consequences of liquidating distributions are tested by IRC Section (“§”) 704(c)(1)(B), §731(c) and §737, in that order or sequence.

Notable, § 704(c)(1)(B) requires that Build-in-Gain, the difference between the asset’s fair market value and tax basis, be allocated to the contributing partner. Where the contributing partner transfers its interest, the transferee will receive the allocation. This has a dramatic impact upon the recipient of a gift that does not have the cash to pay the income tax resulting from a distribution.

Layman should realize that marketable securities, broadly defined, are treated as cash, resulting in immediate taxation upon distribution, unless one of four exceptions applies. Perhaps it is equally important to the success of partnership to anticipate an exit strategy at the outset. If anything, this tempers the expectations of the participants and makes them sensitive to the planning.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">It is that time of the year again, but do you know how to take advantage of your charitable donations?</h3>
<h3></h3>
If you don't, the IRS has published its <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Tips for Year-End Giving</a>
<h3><a href="tis-the-season-to-be-charitable" rel="attachment wp-att-422"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/3703145222_428db0fdbc-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></h3>
Individuals and businesses making charitable gifts should be mindful of some basic guidelines:
<ul>
<li>To deduct a monetary charitable donation, a taxpayer must have a bank record (bank statement, credit card statement, or cancelled check) of the donation or a written acknowledgment from the charity</li>
<li>Contributions are deductible <strong>in the year made </strong>(even if you do not pay the actual credit card bill until 2012)</li>
<li>Try to obtain a receipt from the charity for donations of clothing, household items, and other personal items that reflects the <strong>fair market value</strong> of the item at the time of the donation.</li>
</ul>
Moreover, older taxpayers may make substantial contributions to charities from their IRAs per a special tax provision that expires on 12/31/2011:

An IRA owner, age 70½ or over, can directly transfer tax-free up to $100,000 per year to an eligible charity. This option, created in 2006, is available for distributions from IRAs, regardless of whether the owners itemize their deductions. Distributions from employer-sponsored retirement plans, including SIMPLE IRAs and simplified employee pension (SEP) plans, are not eligible.

To qualify, the funds must be contributed directly by the IRA trustee to the eligible charity. Amounts so transferred are not taxable and no deduction is available for the transfer.

Amounts transferred to a charity from an IRA are counted in determining whether the owner has met the IRA’s required minimum distribution. Where individuals have made nondeductible contributions to their traditional IRAs, a special rule treats transferred amounts as coming first from taxable funds, instead of proportionately from taxable and nontaxable funds, as would be the case with regular distributions.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3>The Drama Continues...Queue the Red Tape!</h3>
The first blog installment discussed the difficulties in establishing an exit strategy for a business entity, and a few problems that occur when transferring interests from an entity to a specific partner. The general rule is that gain is not recognized when property is distributed to a partner by a partnership, except where cash distributed exceeds a partner’s tax basis.  This is why a partnership is so popular; however, in taxation, popularity is usually followed by more restrictions.
<h3><a href="breaking-up-is-so-hard-to-do-part-2-of-3" rel="attachment wp-att-438"><img class="size-medium wp-image-438 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/3663632905_b4ff80344f-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></h3>
The rules are designed to tax three situations.  Let's say, for example, that property contributed by "partner A" is distributed "to partner B" within

7 years of the date of contribution. The built-in-gain (mentioned previously) to Partner A calculated at the time of contribution will usually be taxed.  This prevents partnerships from being used to disguise what is, in reality, a sale. Another restriction in this case would be that the property (other than money) that has appreciated will be distributed to a partner that contributed  appreciated property within the previous seven years to the entity.

Even more importantly comes a point that in negotiations, partner A must be aware of the potential for gain recognition in such a circumstance and protect himself. §737 changes the traditional non-recognition rule under these circumstances by causing partner A to recognize the lesser of the built-in-gain or the excess of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_market_value" target="_blank">Fair Market Value</a> of the property he receives over his basis.

The third situation is to tax distributions of marketable securities as money.  An exception to  an exception is for investment partnerships.

The final installment will discuss some strategies for avoiding gain recognition when distributing assets, and some unexpected results from that become apparent investment partnerships.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Each January 1<sup>st</sup>, many of us set goals or resolutions for the upcoming year, hoping to break old habits and start the New Year off on a healthier, more enlightened path.  But in addition to those weight loss and fitness goals, we must also think about our financial and legal health as well.  This analysis is critical because the $5,000,000 federal exemption expires and will revert to $1,000,000 in 2012.  Many of us have postponed important decisions on estate planning because we believed Congress would extend the exemption. Even a casual review of the news from Washington casts doubt on the reasonableness of that belief in the face of upcoming national elections.

<a href="estate-planning-resolutions-for-the-new-year/" rel="attachment wp-att-451"><img class=" wp-image-451 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2011/12/5337382499_2a6fd9a4a6-300x199.jpg" width="240" height="159" /></a>Let 2012 be the year to make sure you have faced the issues and have at least the basic estate planning tools in place.  We recommend you ask yourself the questions set out below in Part I and make the following 2012 Estate Planning Resolutions in Part II.
<h3>Part I- Critical Questions</h3>
Does your estate have enough liquidity to pay the increased federal death taxes resulting from the lower federal exemption?  Have you properly accounted for the New Jersey estate tax exemption of only $675,000 in your plan? Does your estate plan rely upon the unlimited marital deduction to escape tax at the first death so as to postpone taxation until the death of your spouse?

Have you considered what alternative courses of action are available to you in the face of the diminished federal exemption of $1,000,000 that is scheduled to take effect or you have relied upon the marital deduction or Congressional action to solve your problem?

Have you considered annual exclusion gifts, life insurance trusts, low-interest loans, 529 Plans and direct payments of tuition and medical expenses as ways of transferring wealth to family members?
<h3>Part II</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power of Attorneys and Living Will</strong>:   These documents are necessary in the event that you become incapacitated. A Health Care Power of Attorney lets you decide in advance who will make your health decisions while you are incapacitated.  A Durable Power of Attorney dictates who should make your financial decisions while you are unable to do so. And, a living will or advanced medical directive tells medical staff what actions to take should you be placed on life support or be deemed terminally ill</li>
<li><strong>Will</strong>:  Every adult should have a Will, which determines how your assets and property will be divided at your death and who (the executor) will be responsible for distributing these assets.  Moreover, the Will can and should name guardians for your children, ensuring their future well-being.  A Will not only makes sense financially and legally, but it helps avoid painful family conflicts that often occur over assets when no Will is in place. Are your selections still valid based on age,  health, financial circumstances and strength of relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiaries</strong>: <strong> </strong>Review all life insurance policies and retirement accounts to make sure the named beneficiaries are an accurate reflection of your wishes.</li>
</ul>
If you already have these essential estate planning documents, make a resolution to have them updated.  If your marital status has changed since you last drafted these documents, or you have new children or grandchildren, or you’ve gained or lost significant property or assets, then you need to update these documents to reflect your current financial outlook and life situation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[So, we've had our ups, and we've had our downs. Hopefully by now, you can gauge the commitment that is made when establishing a business entity, and how breaking up that commitment--regardless of the context--is seldom clear-cut, and often frustrating. I have written about exit strategies and the consequent problems when facing taxes on assets. I have also elaborated on certain situations where a partnership can be taxed.  In the last installment, I would like to discuss some strategies for avoiding gain recognition when distributing assets, and some of the unexpected results that become apparent.

<a href="breaking-up-is-so-hard-to-do-part-3-of-3" rel="attachment wp-att-481"><img class="size-full wp-image-481 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/4524398257_34922f3798.jpg" width="257" height="174" /></a>Strategies for avoiding gain recognition upon distribution generally consist of waiting seven years, transfer of partnership interests to a grantor trust, or distributing the property to the partner who contributed it.  Nestled with the rules are some interesting and painful surprises.

Investment Partnerships – Notwithstanding the three sections, those entities meeting the definition of an investment partnership have their own escape hatches to recognition upon distribution of a security. Investment partnerships are not engaged in a trade or business, and consist primarily (90% or more) of investment securities.  There are four exceptions to immediate recognition upon distribution of a security  and they apply when : (1) the security was contributed by the partner receiving the security; (2) the security was not a marketable security when acquired by the distributing partnership plus additional conditions are met; (3) the partnership acquired the security in a non-recognition transaction plus additional conditions are met; or (4) the partnership is an investment partnership and the partner is an eligible partner.

A surprise occurs when the interests transferred by parent have built-in-gain as part of the legacy.  Unexpected results occur when a parent transfers interests to her 3 children and Child#1 wants to be cashed out.  Thus, the distribution to Child1 causes all the others to recognize gain.  If one did not love their sibling before, the transaction, they will love them even less once the consequences are known.

The final surprise to most, but not all, readers is that relief from indebtedness is treated as a  cash distribution.  Exit strategies may not garner much attention at the time of contribution, but they can have a dramatic impact upon one’s net worth.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[“New Jersey and You: Perfect Together”, the <a href="http://www.nj.gov/">State’s</a> tourism slogan, will never be borrowed to describe gifts of S corporation stock. An S corporation, simply put, is a corporation that elects to be taxed under sub chapter "S" of the Internal Revenue Code, and essentially borrows rules from both standard C corporations and partnerships. What is striking is how big of a difference there is between certain transfers of S corporation stock as opposed to C (regular) corporation stock.

<a href="the-absence-of-symmetry-part-1-of-2" rel="attachment wp-att-491"><img class="size-medium wp-image-491 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/6060588273_76f0c39b83-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>The most notable difference is that the rules are consistent for charitable and non-charitable transfers for partnerships and C corporations, but not so for S corporations.  S corporations were designed for small businesses and to permit income to pass through and be taxed once at the shareholder level.

For example, when one donates S corporation stock to charity, the partnership rules apply rather than the C corporation rules. Yet, if S corporation stock is sold, it is treated in the same manner as a sale of C corporation stock yielding capital gain. Contrast this treatment with the sale of a partnership interest, where a mixture of capital gain and ordinary income result from “hot assets” such as receivables. I am personally grateful that S corporations cannot have foreign shareholders, seeing as I would have to explain all of this to them. Not even the best Microsoft Power Point presentation would save me in that case.
<h4>Wait, A Charity Does Not Want Charity?</h4>
A charity that may receive S corporation stock is unnerved by the complexities that result from such a gift.  Imagine trying to establish a fair return to construct a charitable gift annuity. A charity may not want to receive the stock directly, so what options do we then have?

S corporations restrict shareholders to US citizens and residents and certain trusts.  There are two trusts, Electing Small Business Trust (ESBT) and Qualified Subchapter S Trust (QSST) that are unique to S corporations.  A grantor trust, many times a revocable living trust, is a permitted shareholder.  A grantor trust may remain a shareholder for two years after death as may a testamentary trust that does not otherwise qualify.  A voting trust and a state law trust that is a charity or qualified retirement plan also qualify. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_lead_trust#charitable_lead_trust">Charitable Lead Trusts (CLT)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_remainder_trust#charitable_remainder_trust">Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT)</a> are popular, but only a CLT that is a grantor trust can hold S stock. Charities afflicted with Private foundations status or those designated as supporting organizations face excise taxes on business holdings.  The excise taxes are designed to level the playing field between non-exempt taxpayers and charities where the latter engages in a business. There are also prohibitions against self-dealing with related parties, yet another minefield (and not the game). Despite all of these various restrictions, however, there are options that will allow a business entity to avoid cumbersome taxes, excise included.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As I mentioned in the first part of the series, the news is not all bad for those facing unwanted excise taxes.  A private foundation (PF) can avoid excise taxes if it owns less than 2% of the S corporation stock.  A charity may hold S corporation for five years if no more than 20% of stock is owned by the donor, his or her family and a PF and avoid excise taxes.  A PF may own unlimited amount of non-voting stock provided that disqualified persons, a defined tax term, own less than 20% of the voting stock.  There are many private rulings in the area that shape the contours.
<h4><a href="the-absence-of-symmetry-part-2-of-2" rel="attachment wp-att-505"><img class="wp-image-505 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/2416262874_a1b15671d0-300x225.jpg" width="240" height="180" /></a>I'd Like to Order a CLT Sandwich, Hold the ESBT Please</h4>
What does one do with a CLT after five years, or if the grantor dies during its term?  Most convert the trust to an ESBT, a less than welcome choice, for a charitable trust.  The ESBT’s 35% ordinary income tax rate applies but not to any capital gain. There is no charitable deduction for distributions to the charity that would reduce the 35% bite, but there is from the non-S portion of the trust [for example when it holds other assets.]

Many advisors recommend that the S corporation give away an asset rather than suffer these rules upon the donor and a charity.  Charities prefer the sale of the asset to avoid UBIT.  Charities may not welcome the fact that S corporation income is UBIT, subject to tax, even if it arises from an activity that furthers a charitable purpose, whereas the same income in a LLC is not.   Distributions from a S corporation in excess of basis are capital gain. Losses may be limited by the passive loss rules and may not offset other income of the charity.  [Explain that result to the Board].  Low basis in S corporation stock may cause distributions to be taxable whereas LLC basis may have been higher due to the treatment of indebtedness. This is a another reason why a charity may be reluctant to accept S corporation stock.  If the donation of stock is the only option, the recipient should be a charitable trust rather a charitable corporation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The United States Congress believes it has ability to override income tax treaties negotiated by the Executive Branch as evidenced by the passage of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/894">IRC §894</a> and other provisions.  People who are in support of the supremacy of international law may argue that overrides violate the standards of fairness, but not in a case where taxes are involved (all is fair game). The Constitution implies that overrides are permitted as set forth in Article VI: “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”
<h4><a href="overriding-tax-treaties-an-inside-look" rel="attachment wp-att-527"><img class="wp-image-527 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/2581961357_4f3648b672_m1.jpg" width="187" height="240" /></a>Early Beginnings...</h4>
Ah, 1980. During a time when people were blasting Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall" on their car stereos, the US introduced treaty overrides when it sought to tax gains on the sale of real estate by foreigners.  Payments to a non-resident must be reduced by a statutory 30% withholding tax unless a treaty provision applies and provides for a lower rate. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRPTA">Foreign Interests in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA)</a> marked the beginning of legislative attempts to defend the public fisc by limiting techniques that would otherwise qualify for low or no withholding taxes under a treaty.  The US has conduit financing rules that are designed to prevent the use of jurisdictions for low tax rates and withholding to extract profits from the US at rates that may otherwise be available.  The IRC §894 rules are designed to prevent pass-through entities from claiming treaty benefits where the funds it receives will be passed on to an entity that would suffer withholding at a higher rate of tax.

&nbsp;
<h4>Tea and Treaties, Anyone?</h4>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/overriding-tax-treaties-an-inside-look/" rel="attachment wp-att-524"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-524" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/4378522894_d2722f93e0_m.jpg" width="240" height="120" /></a>The UK, not to be outdone, also has introduced specific legislation last year that would also override treaties.  The <a href="http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/consult_condoc_statutory_residence.pdf">UK’s Statutory Residency Test</a>, for determining if one is to be taxed as a resident,  was designed to provide an objective means by which one could determine residency status.  Artists and authors often depart for  lower tax climates prior to receipt of significant royalty payments or a stream of such payments.  The override would attempt to catch these individuals through the use of “connecting factors” and allows the tax authorities to ignore treaties and the Statutory Residence Test.  The impact of the override could cause businesses to be taxed on capital transactions thought to be protected by treaty. I understand that businesses with fixed locations would not be so tormented and could rely on existing rules...
<h4>BUT...</h4>
The US has about sixty treaties, the UK twice that number and Hong Kong has about one-half of the US.  This suggests that residence and business operations would be established in particular jurisdictions with treaties in part because of the absence of broad treaty networks.   How does an individual or business evaluate New York, London or Hong Kong as locations where the ultimate determination of qualification is subjective and will be rendered useless some years from now?  If each taxing jurisdiction creates its own overrides, designed to address situations that offend the local treasury, my copy of international tax treaties will be named the “Book of Exceptions.”]]></content>

<a href="irs-has-reopened-its-offshore-voluntary-disclosure-program" rel="attachment wp-att-545"><img class="size-full wp-image-545 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/5969148210_4490b92fb0_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>To participate in the program, participants must file all original and amended tax returns and include payment for back-taxes and interest for up to eight years, as well as applicable penalties.  Most participants will pay a penalty of 27.5 percent of the highest aggregate balance in foreign bank accounts/entities or the value of foreign assets during the eight years prior to disclosure. Some taxpayers with smaller valued offshore accounts may eligible for a reduced penalty.  For example, those with under $75,000 in offshore accounts in any calendar year may qualify for a rate between 5 percent and 12.5 percent.

Currently, the IRS has set no deadline for when the program ends and has indicated that it will release more information and an FAQ within the coming weeks.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="onward-to-alaska-strategies-for-selling-assets" rel="attachment wp-att-554"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/6118420004_8aec22b3d3_z-300x185.jpg" width="300" height="185" /></a> Free Glacier Rides for Everyone![/caption]
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Background</h4>
It is not uncommon for clients to have valuable assets that, if sold, would cause a great deal of gain. The client's dilemma is whether to hold the asset until death, thereby obtaining step-up in basis to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_market_value"> fair market value (FMV)</a> from the estate, or to transfer the asset by gift to the next generation. What makes this more difficult are the tax rules for  jointly held property, which vary from state to state.

For example, if Mary and Doug own property as a husband &amp; wife (tenants by the entirety) with a basis of $100,000 and FMV of 10,000,000, then at the first death, there is a basis step-up for only one-half of the value.  This is because one-half of the value jointly held property is included in the taxable estate of the first-to-die, which we shall say is Doug. Mary's basis in the entire property is increased to $5,050,000, which is the the sum of (i) one-half of the original basis of $100,000 belonging to Mary and (ii)one-half of the step-up in basis to $10,000,000 FMV resulting from Doug's estate.

There are other choices. One could borrow against the property and wait till death to sell or repay.  The other choice is community property.  In my example above, Mary and Doug lived in a common law state, not a community property state, the most famous of which is California.  If Mary and Doug had selected Alaska's elective community property law to a trust they established there, then the result would have been different.  On Doug's death, all of the community property is included in Doug's estate at its $10,000,000  FMV.  Mary can sell it without recognizing any capital gain or transfer it to the children who take the increased basis of $10,000,000 as their own.  No one can argue that eliminating the $9,900,000 of capital gain is not worth the effort.

As the economy improves and asset values rebound, this may be a worthwhile strategy to consider.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Previously, I wrote about the use of <a title="Onward! To Alaska! Strategies for Selling Assets" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/onward-to-alaska-strategies-for-selling-assets/">Alaska Community Property</a> as a way to increase (“step-up”) to fair market value the basis of appreciated property at the first death of a married couple.  This technique addressed the dilemma of whether to gift the property today when value is depressed and avoid death tax on future appreciation, or to hold until death to obtain the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stepupinbasis.asp#axzz1jwMdN0Ap">step-up in basis</a>.

[caption id="attachment_607" align="alignright" width="212"]<a href="onward-to-alaska-strategies-for-selling-assets-part-2-of-2" rel="attachment wp-att-607"><img class="size-full wp-image-607  " alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/4364993876_c290df5ed8_m1.jpg" width="212" height="240" /></a> Death, Taxes, and Polar Bears[/caption]

If the low-basis property is held until death in order to obtain the step-up, one of the risks is that asset appreciation or inflation will increase the death taxes faced by the estate.  In fact, a person risks continuing uncertainty because tax rates and the size of the exclusion are not firmly established. If a transfer is made, the income tax will be paid by the recipients.

Some people resist the idea of using an out-of-state trustee and applying law that is not local.  People do have other alternatives.  One such alternative is the use of a joint trust with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_appointment">power of appointment</a>.  Normally, one-half of joint property is included in the estate of the first-to-die and that portion obtains the step-up by virtue of being subject to estate tax.  In a community property state, the entire value is included at the first death and receives a step-up.  The joint trust approach attempts to secure the step-up by including one-half as being owned by the decedent and the other half by virtue of the power of appointment.

The joint trust approach does not provide asset protection, an additional benefit available in states like Alaska, but may work for those of us who want to remain close to home.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/4888626889_344d8e1e4c_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-709" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/4888626889_344d8e1e4c_m.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="144" /></a>I was surprised by the public excitement raised in reaction to Mitt Romney’s disclosure about having signatory authority over foreign bank accounts.  I expected that the US media and the public would accept the fact that we are in a global economy and that US persons will do business cross-borders and sometimes exclusively outside the US.  The US reporting requirements have persons with signatory authority over financial accounts to report the existence of the account to the US Treasury.  I would have been surprised, given Mr. Romney’s position at Bain Capital,  if he had no foreign accounts.  That would have been a story in itself.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/6151421224_aeafacb2a1_m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-708 alignright" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/6151421224_aeafacb2a1_m.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>There are two parts to this story. One aspect focuses on the reporting of foreign account requirements, while the second focuses on the structural aspect of foreign accounts. Persons required to report foreign accounts include those you might not otherwise thought of as being subject to reporting, such as:

(1) An employee or officer of a covered entity who has signature or other authority over and no financial interest in a foreign financial account of another entity more than 50% owned, directly or indirectly, by the entity (a controlled person); and

(2) An employee or officer of a controlled person of a covered entity who has signature or other authority over and no financial interest in a foreign financial account of the entity or another controlled person of the entity.

This caught some by surprise, so the IRS 2011-57, 5/31/11, announced an additional extension of the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) filing deadline until 6/30/12 for the these individuals.  A public corporation, with numerous foreign subsidiaries, may have hundreds of foreign accounts.  Some accounts receive deposits from customers and clients, others may purchase products. Accounts may also hedge currency and commodity (e.g. oil, sugar or cotton) risk.  The point is that there are many persons in corporate America with signatory authority over such accounts whose pictures do not appear in annual reports. Even your neighbor may have to file because of tasks assigned in the ordinary course of employment.

The second part is flexibility. US hedge funds also do not want to become subject to the same restrictions and registration requirements as a mutual fund under the<a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/ica40.pdf"> Investment Company Act of 1940</a>.  One need only look at a mutual fund prospectus to realize that there are costs for advertising, answering telephones, mailing statements and prospectuses.  Avoiding registration permits more leverage, short selling and purchases on margin.  Finally, the advisor need not register as an investment advisor under the<a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/iaa40.pdf"> Investment Advisors Act of 1940</a> if certain other requirements are met. There are also registration requirements under state blue-sky laws that would potentially apply as well (imagine the headaches of 10 investors in ten different states). Thus, a foreign registration in the Cayman Islands or anywhere else makes sense.

Where will our jobs come from in the future?  We recognize that old-line manufacturing has moved offshore. We must also recognize that there are compelling reasons to locate the newest chip plant overseas. Contract research and development for pharmaceuticals is performed in Hong Kong and Singapore. The US must grudgingly acknowledge the new reality that capital will flow to locations that provide the best opportunity and tax policy must adapt as well.  The fact that the location chosen was the Cayman's and not New York should tell us something.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I received an email from the <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/Pages/Default.aspx">AICPA</a> about a seminar.  The email described the  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=98137,00.html">Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”)</a> as having 71,600 pages and its size is increasing at a rate of 3.28% a year. It went on to state that one must keep current of all of the changes and reminded the reader that revenue rulings, revenue procedures, information releases, chief counsel memorandum and private letter rulings were not included in calculating the increase of 3.28%.  It also did not include the volumes of regulations that put the flesh on the bones of the IRC.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/3756880888_88b531ab0b_m.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-734" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/3756880888_88b531ab0b_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>I thought back to my first job in 1980 where I met a sixty year old tax attorney.  He had decades of tax experience and was very thoughtful.  We were plowing through all of the law, regulations and rulings one night and he commented that there was so much more information to examine.  He recalled that when he was in law school the IRC and regulations were in one volume and had just gone to two volumes.  That night the IRC consisted of two volumes and the regulations were in three volumes.  For those of us who are old enough, these volumes were printed on tissue paper and had to be supplemented by the Internal Revenue Bulletins issued periodically.  There were no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a>, just young law school graduates rummaging through the library and the offices of other attorneys looking for books. I know that I have crossed over when I can say “I remember when…”

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/radio/">Bloomberg Radio</a> announced that Gross Domestic Product was 2.7%. I agree that when the rate of growth in the tax code of 3.28% exceeds GDP, the economy will feel stagnant. <a href="http://dc.gov/">Washington</a> talks about a simplified tax code, but as our old tax attorney had pointed out, there is much more information to examine in this area of law than one might suspect. [For example, it is very hard to treat the timber industry the same as a retailer or a service provider.] If Washington attempts this great feat, I wish them luck, but it is difficult for me to see this change.  There are proposals for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax">Value Added Tax</a> (VAT), but it appears every country that has a VAT also has income taxes.  For every country that taxes on a territorial basis and not a worldwide basis, there will still be inter company pricing to address.  Perhaps the IRC is a reflection of the fact that the world we live in is complicated, very complicated and inter-related.]]></content>

Today, <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">Scarinci Hollenbeck</a> launched, <a href="http://youtu.be/pUnFIxTbT8I">"New Jersey Case Law"</a>, the second installment for their seven part video series, "Tax Issues That Impact Your Wealth". When a taxpayer fails to maintain proper statutory records, or if the records are deemed unreliable, independent determinations are made. In this video, I provide a few case examples to show how these determinations can vary in favor for the State or the tax payer. Each new installment to the series will be posted to this blog and Scarinci Hollenbeck's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/scarincihollenbeck">YouTube</a> each week, so be sure to stop there and check out the rest!

In 1991, the Driver established a trust in <a href="http://www.texas.gov/en/Pages/default.aspx">Texas</a> for the benefit of his two children by his first marriage with a gift of $1.5m.  {There is a question of whether the funds were those of the grandfather or the Driver.] The 1991 trust has grown substantially and is reportedly worth over $100 million today as the family business was sold before the accident for $1.4billion.  The proper application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation-skipping_transfer_tax">Generation Skipping Tax Exclusion</a> in 1991 could allow the trust to continue indefinitely. This is an estate planning attorney's version of winning the lottery or the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/46">Super Bowl</a>.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/3811735492_95e3b4fa0c.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/3811735492_95e3b4fa0c-215x300.jpg" width="129" height="180" /></a>The Driver, age 49, adopted, in Florida, his girlfriend, age 42, whereupon she became the third eligible beneficiary of the trust because the language, written in 1991, included children born to or adopted by the Driver after the execution of the trust instrument.  The language is not unusual or nefarious.   The victim’s attorneys state that the adoption gives the girlfriend-daughter 70% of one-third of the income of the trust, $1,000,000 immediately, $3,000,000 in 2012 and about $4,750,000 each year thereafter.  The 70% of her one-third share is reflected in an “<a href="http://family.findlaw.com/adoption/glossary-of-adoption-terms.html">Adoption Agreement</a>” with the 30% being distributed to the other beneficiaries, the two children, and other restrictions.

The victim’s counsel claims that the adoption and Adoption Agreement give Driver the ability to use his assets as his own and extrapolate that, with each adoption, subsequently draining the 1991 trust.  I suppose Driver would find enough volunteers willing to be adopted.

Why the attack?  Clearly the 1991 trust predated the accident and cannot be attacked on grounds of being a fraudulent transfer.  The answer is found in the pleadings in that Plaintiff’s counsel wants the side agreement and the adoption to be introduced as evidence of Driver’s financial resources “…..so the jury can assess a punitive damage verdict in an amount that will punish (the Driver).  They go on to say it is not clear whether an attempt to collect any judgment would have to be made against the 1991 Trust.  I cannot say whether Driver has undertaken<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_protection"> asset protection</a> making collection impossible or not. There is no indication that Driver attempted to make a fraudulent conveyance from other assets in his name.

What does this case stand for? I will leave the rules of evidence to others, but clearly admission of foregoing, for purposes of determining the financial resources of the Driver for assessing damages, impacts the asset protection aspect of the 1991 Trust. If matters surrounding the adoption and 1991 Trust are placed before a jury that is assessing damages and they react by raising the damage award, is there overall asset protection? You can be certain that the attorneys for the other two beneficiaries are watching.]]></content>

<a title="The New Jersey Tax Court" href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/taxcourt/index.htm" target="_blank">The New Jersey Tax Court</a> has affirmed a municipality’s determination of true value of a residential property after finding that the purchaser’s sale price standing alone was insufficient to provide a reliable evidence of market value.

In these difficult economic times for homeowners and municipalities, the payment and receipt of real property taxes are important.  Real property taxes are assessed and paid based on a property’s full and fair value which is defined as the price of the property would sell for at a “fair and bona fide sale” by private contract on October 1.  Taxable value is a fixed percentage of true value.  Hence, the method used to determine true value is critical.

Recently, in a Tax Court decision (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Gibbons V. City of East Orange" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14101741786494447025&amp;q=Gibbons+v.+City+of+East+Orange&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank">Gibbons v. City of East Orange</a>)</span> a residence was assessed at $262,100 but had been purchased for $125,000 within a month after the assessment. The owner challenged the assessment. The Board of Taxation however entered a judgment affirming the assessment.  The owner appealed to the Tax Court maintaining that the assessment should be the purchase price of the residence, namely, $125,000 not the assessed value<!--more-->

The Tax Court noted that it is well-established that original assessments and judgments of county boards of taxation are entitled to a presumption of validity. The scope of this presumption has been stated as follows:
<ul>
<li>The presumption attaches to the quantum of the tax assessment.</li>
<li>Based on this presumption the appealing taxpayer has the burden of proving that the assessment is erroneous.</li>
<li>The presumption in favor of the taxing authority can be rebutted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> by cogent evidence, a proposition that has long been settled.</li>
<li>The strength of the presumption is exemplified by the nature of the evidence that is required to overcome it. That evidence must be definite, positive and certain in quality and quantity to overcome the presumption.</li>
</ul>
The Tax Court found the assessment to be correct because in tax matters there is a presumption that governmental authority has been exercised correctly and in accordance with law. The presumption remains in place even if the municipality utilized a flawed<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_valuation" target="_blank"> valuation methodology</a>, so long as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quantum</span> of the assessment is not so far removed from the true value of the property or the method of assessment itself is so patently defective as to justify removal of the presumption of validity.

To overcome the presumption, the property owner must provide sufficient competent evidence to the contrary. The evidence must be sufficient to determine the value of the property thereby establishing the existence of a debatable question as to the correctness of the assessment. The burden of proof remains on the <a title="Taxpayer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax" target="_blank">taxpayer</a> throughout the entire case to demonstrate that the judgment under review was incorrect.

The comparable sales approach is generally accepted as an appropriate method of estimating value for a residence. In this approach, the market value for the subject property is derived by comparing similar properties that have recently sold with the property being appraised, identifying appropriate units of comparison, and making adjustments to the sale prices of the comparable properties based on relevant, market-derived elements of comparison.

In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gibbons</span>, the Plaintiff did not offer any comparable sales or any other evidence to establish that the assessment on the residence was incorrect, or that its market value should be $125,000 (the residence’s purchase price) as of the date of assessment.  The Plaintiff contended that because the residence’s sale was between a willing seller and herself, a willing buyer, the residence’s sale price was a reliable indicator of its market value.

The Tax Court noted that the sales price of a property <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> be the best indicator of its true value in some circumstances. However, while a property's sale price <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> be evidence of market value, it still requires that the sale meets the other requirements of market value.

The court noted the sale price is “a guiding indicium of fair value and ordinarily is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">merely evidential</span> although it might under peculiar circumstances become controlling, subject to the limitation that the determination properly involves the weighing and appraising of all component factors and adventitious circumstances." The weight, if any, to be afforded the sale must depend upon all of the facts and circumstances surrounding it.

Moreover the Court noted that an arms' length transaction is one between a knowledgeable buyer, under no compelling obligation to buy, and a willing knowledgeable seller, under no compelling obligation to sell. The court determined that the sale may not have been at arms length and the evidence as to the surrounding circumstances of the sale tended to establish that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sale price was not a reliable indicator of the residence’s market value</span>.  It noted that the residence was vacant and in need of repairs. The <a href="http://www.mls.com/" target="_blank">MLS </a>also noted the need for fixing up of the residence. It was also not disputed that the owner was ill and in a nursing home. There were no negotiations with the seller. Rather, plaintiff's first offer was immediately accepted. These facts, the Court noted, corroborate the statement in the MLS that the owner was "anxious" to sell. The evidence thus indicated that the seller desired to make a quick sale, which tends to prove that the residence was sold by one who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> under a compelling obligation to sell.

Finally, that plaintiff was a willing and knowledgeable buyer did not overcome the evidence that the seller's daughter desired to make a quick sale of her father's vacant house.  The Court emphasized <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each</span> party must not be under any urgency or compulsion to finalize the transaction.

Therefore, the court determined the residence’s sale price, standing alone, was insufficient to provide a reliable evidence of market value in the absence of any other corroborative evidence of comparable sales or of market conditions. The court found that the plaintiff has not met her burden to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the judgment of the Board of Taxation was incorrect.

The result reached by the Tax Court while not surprising underscores the difficulty a property owner has in challenging a real property tax assessment especially where the purchase price is less than the <a title="assessed value" href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessedvalue.asp#axzz1ldYDJZ69" target="_blank">assessed value</a>. One would think that sale price would carry more weight but in the final analysis it is only evidence of value and not determinative.  Providing other corroborative evidence of true value is a critical component of a challenge to a real property tax assessment.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I received a call from an old client who had retired and moved away.  The client had met a prospective spouse who was a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/law/family_issues/marriage/marriage_589.html">citizen of a civil law country</a>, and they were discussing marriage. In addition, they were also discussing moving permanently to a third country, where neither one was a citizen or resident.  The client had question about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement"> pre-nuptial agreements</a>, choice of laws, and tax issues.  One of my questions, which troubled my client, was the length of time that the prospective spouse had spent in the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/">United States</a> and whether permanent residency had been already acquired.

<a href="sometimes-random-client-telephone-calls-produce-the-most-interesting-questions"><img class="wp-image-788 alignright" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/marriage1-150x112.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="176" /></a>I was, in turn, asked what would happen if the client relinquished <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis">United States citizenship</a>.  The answer is somewhat complicated.  U.S. citizens, having a net worth of $2,000,000 or average income over 5 years of $145,000, who become expatriates, have a number of issues with which to deal.  These include whether to make a mark-to-market gain recognition or elect to defer gain.  In addition, if the U.S. person successfully becomes an expatriate, any United States citizens or residents who receive a bequest from the ex-pat are then subject under §877A of the Internal Revenue Code to an inheritance tax (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">See</span> IRC §2801).   Yes, §2801 is a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses">federal inheritance tax</a>.  The client at issue here has children that will remain in the United States and be the objects of the client’s bounty.  I also cautioned the client that civil law jurisdictions have forced heirship that prevents one spouse from disinheriting the other.

The prospective spouse in my client’s case is a citizen of an <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm">E.U. country </a>and has a number of interesting options available, leaving aside any U.S. options that might apply.  For example, residence in Belgium acts as a form of economic citizenship that may prove interesting. Although <a href="http://www.belgium.be/en/">Belgium</a> taxes citizens on worldwide income, it does not <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106799,00.html">tax capital gains</a>, and it taxes dividends at 15% to 25% depending on the type of shares.  It may even be possible to avoid the equivalent of estate taxes and income taxation of certain foreign source income.  The Belgium treaty network is extensive and the applicable treaty, between Belgium and the country where the prospective spouse is a citizen, is helpful in ceding residency and taxation.  The issues of the prospective spouse are very different from those faced by the United States client.  What is more important is that solutions available to the prospective spouse are easier to achieve.

There are other choices for the prospective spouse.  The citizenship by investment program in St Kitts allows one to make an investment in real estate or a contribution ($250,000 to $500,000) to a public charity in exchange for citizenship without requiring residency.  Citizens of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis are allowed to hold dual citizenship, and the acquisition of citizenship is not reported to other countries.  It has a passport program that allows travel to many countries without visas.

What may be a possible solution may not be a reasonable one in the eyes of the client, or the client’s the prospective spouse.  I therefore suspect that my client will need to give this some careful consideration before moving forward.]]></content>

While it is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/slideshow/Osbourne-Tax-Trouble-3038250" target="_blank">celebrity tax</a> stories that most often make the headlines, businesses and individuals frequently face the serious consequences of having a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108339,00.html" target="_blank">tax lien</a> filed against them when the IRS determines that federal taxes have gone unpaid. A lien gives the IRS a legal claim to all of a taxpayer’s property as security for tax debt.

<!--more-->The IRS will send a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108339,00.html#Notice">Notice of Federal Tax Lien</a></span> only after:
<ul>
<li>It assesses a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp#axzz1mOZvWD2n">tax liability</a>;</li>
<li>It sends the taxpayer a Notice and Demand for Payment, which details the amount of taxes owed; and</li>
<li>The taxpayer neglects or refuses to fully pay the debt within 10 days after the Notice and Demand for Payment is sent.</li>
</ul>
The filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien is detrimental to a business or individual’s credit rating and can restrict one’s ability to obtain financing or to secure a commercial lease. Moreover, because an IRS tax lien is a public record and thus accessible by tabloids and news media, the filing of a tax lien can be quite embarrassing and harmful to the reputation of celebrities, politicians, high-profile citizens, and well-known corporations.   Therefore, taxpayers who receive any correspondence or notices from the IRS alleging unpaid taxes should immediately <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/">consult with counsel</a></span> and seek to resolve the issue before a Notice of Federal Tax Lien is filed.]]></content>

The battle starts with a family business and aging parents.  The children – rightly or wrongly – begin to angle to protect their own interests.  Children threaten to withhold the grandchildren to gain leverage.  Children feed the fears and insecurities of an aging parent that the child in charge of the business will bankrupt it, or that this child is taking too much money out of the business.

Who is capable of running the business?  I have seen two very intelligent children, successful in endeavors outside of a family business, step into the family operation and cause the business to close in eight months.  In this particular instance, the child who had spent all of his adult life in the business was forced out, and the other two children assumed control of  the business. The employees that remained after his departure warned the two children against taking certain actions that affected the quality of the product.  Their advice was not taken, and the finished goods were rejected by the customer and returned.  The next act of hubris by the two children was to demand payment in advance or cash on delivery.  The industry did not operate that way, and the business closed.<!--more-->

Another common pattern is that of a business run by a strong parent who does not install his or her successor before the parent’s death or illness.  The result is a void where the children fight for power.  For example, a tenant in a commercial shopping center did not pay rent, and the self-proclaimed family successor met with the owner of the tenant.  The owner of the tenant  claimed the landlord had concealed the fact that construction would block access to the center and that, had the owner known, he would not have signed the lease.  What the successor did not know was the owner lived ten minutes from the shopping center and, like everyone in town, was advised of the schedule for replacing water and sewer pipes.  The successor did not check with the town’s construction official and failed to learn that the tenant’s own electrical work failed to meet code.  The self-appointed successor gave a rent credit of approximately fifty thousand dollars.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney" target="_blank">Powers of attorney</a> (“POA”), <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/revocablelivingtrust.asp#axzz1n1lEADiF" target="_blank">revocable living trusts</a> (“RLT”) and voting stock can upset the delicate balance of informal succession plans.  It is interesting that there are certain offshore trust regimes that attempt to address this issue by absolving the trustees of oversight for the business and leaving that responsibility for the board of directors.  In a closely-held business, this may only serve to move the battle to the boardroom.

When I advise such families, I ask the parent if all of the children, including those that do not participate in the business, are to benefit from the value of the business at the parent’s death.  Sometimes, the non-participating children can be given other assets in lieu of interests in the business or they may be made beneficiaries of life insurance polices.

In the next blog, I will discuss identifying unresolved issues between and among siblings,  what Frank Brunetti refers to as  “Sandbox Issues” and I will offer additional planning suggestions to address the potential conflict.

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Identifying Sandbox Issues</strong></span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/New-Jersey-Tax-Trusts-and-Estates.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-852" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/New-Jersey-Tax-Trusts-and-Estates-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></strong></span>In the prior post from <a title="The Fight Over the Un-dead Parent" href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/the-fight-over-the-un-dead-parent/" target="_blank">February 21st,</a> I identified circumstances that resulted in the destruction of family wealth.  In this post, I want to address what <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/" target="_blank">Frank Brunetti</a> terms “<strong>Sandbox Issues</strong>.

Sandbox issues are conflicts among siblings during childhood that remain  unresolved into adulthood<strong>,</strong> until they erupt in direct conflict over the assets of the parents.  These conflicts may arise at the time of a parent’s death or prior to death when the parent is either disabled<strong> </strong>or easily influenced by one or more children.

It is important for an attorney to identify potential conflicts in advance, so the documents can be drafted in a manner that will deal with these potential issues.  A child may also face other issues,  such as tax problems, judgments, and divorce.  Although these are not classic sandbox issues, they must also be taken into account in the planning process so an individual will not be tempted to divert funds.<!--more-->

Consider one, all-too-typical circumstance which is a recipe for disaster: after the death of one spouse, the surviving parent executes multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney" target="_blank">powers of attorney</a> (POA),  giving one to each child.  This is the equivalent of providing loaded pistols at a duel.  The parent’s grant of multiple POAs can result in <a href="http://www.justice.gov/jmd/ethics/generalf.htm" target="_blank">unauthorized gifting</a>, a diminished return on a depleted portfolio, and a disproportionate disposition of assets among the children.  It can also result in disqualification for Medicaid under the look-back rule, contrary to the parent’s plan for addressing this issue.

The use of joint accounts may also pose a problem.  Typically, one child cares for a surviving parent living in that child’s home, and that child is then named as a joint tenant on the parent’s bank accounts. That child may feel entitled to the accounts upon death of the parent as compensation for caring for the parent and, often, expending the child’s own funds for the parent’s benefit. The other children may not agree with this view.  The diversion of funds by the caretaker child may occur during the period that the parent resides with him or her. This diversion occurs out of view of the other children who may be grateful that the burden of care is not thrust upon them and are reluctant to inquire about finances. This gratitude often quickly disappears after the death of the parent<strong>,</strong> when the child who provided no care not only wants his share of “his inheritance” but also wants the child who did provide care to account for all of the expended funds.

My most unfortunate case concerned a couple who won the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/home.shtml" target="_blank">lottery</a>.  The couple resided with their daughter, her spouse, and the young couple’s three children.  Matters began with the child’s purchase of larger and newer vehicles to carry the expanded family, and continued with home improvements, vacations, and the payment of living expenses.  It is difficult to draw a line when the parents are already living with a child and are physically and psychologically dependent.

One suggestion is that the bank and brokerage statements or copies are sent to all non-custodial  children. We also suggest that the parent decide ahead of time whether his or her assets can be gifted during his or her lifetime.  One precaution would be to require all gifts be made on an equal basis.  We take the precaution of requiring the consent of a non-beneficiary to any plan of gifting or transfers.  A trusted friend or relative that will not receive any benefit from the transfer may be better able to act in the best interests of the parent.  Protection may also be afforded  by having a disinterested trustee of a trust or co-agents under a power of attorney.  It is also helpful to provide for a dispute resolution procedure such as arbitration or identifying a third party to cast the tie-breaking vote in the event of a deadlock.

One final though of course is that the assets being fought over are not the assets of the children but the parents and consideration be given in any instrument that long term care be provided for the parent.  Proper planning begins with an honest and realistic assessment by the parent of his family and their differences which may result in open conflict.

		<content><![CDATA[While there are many issues connected with protecting the employer in dealing with <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Defined" target="_blank">independent contractors</a>, a few important issues exist concerning the issuance of 1099s.  As noted by the <a href="http://www.americanpayroll.org/" target="_blank">American Payroll Association (APA)</a> in their January press release, below are the key points of which every employer should take note:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Form 1099-MISC is required for noncorporate service providers.</strong></span><strong> </strong> Employers must provide a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf" target="_blank">Form 1099-MISC</a> by January 31st to any noncorporate service provider who was paid at least $600 for services during the prior year.  Employers must also provide Form 1099-MISC to sole proprietorships, partnerships, attorneys, and medical service providers who do business as corporations.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Form 1099-MISC not required if contractor was paid electronically.</strong></span><strong> </strong> There is no requirement to send a Form 1099-MISC to any contractor that was paid electronically, such as by credit card, debit card, PayPal, or gift card.  The bank or credit card company that made the actual payment to the contractor will send the contractor Form 1099-K.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Pilot program for truncation of TIN numbers has been extended.</strong></span><strong> </strong> The IRS pilot program that allows for the truncation of taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) on 1099 forms has been extended to include 1099s through the 2012 calendar year (filed in 2013).  This means that the first five digits of the TIN can be replaced with asterisks or Xs on the payees’ paper copies of Form 1099, but copies filed with the IRS must have their full TIN.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. Better safe than sorry.</strong></span><strong> </strong> Employers who are unsure whether a Form 1099-MISC is required should go ahead and send one.  Employers cannot go wrong by sending 1099s that are not required, but could be subject to penalties if they do not send all service providers their Form 1099.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. File forms on time.</strong></span>  This year paper copies of Forms 1099-MISC must be mailed to the IRS no later than February 28, 2012.  Forms 1099-MISC filed electronically must be submitted to the IRS by April 2, 2012.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I was listening to the radio Friday evening when the announcer described a news report to be aired after a commercial.   Normally, I would change the station but was intrigued by the story -- a son evicting his mother from the home she had lived in for forty years.  The news story reported that the son served the eviction complaint on his mother’s ninety-first birthday, just twelve days before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas" target="_blank">Christmas</a>.  The reporter recited that the son had somehow gained control of the title and was seeking to sell it. Some one more clever than I must be rewriting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_%28song%29" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Twelve Days of Christmas</em></a> with this story in mind.

<a href="evicting-mom"><img class="size-full wp-image-887 alignright" alt="Scarinci Hollenbeck Tax Trust Estate Group" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/02/tax-trusts-estates-Eviction.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a>While we do not know the back-story to this attempt to throw a ninety-one year old into the snow, one suspects that it arose from the desire to cut down on the estate taxes due on the mother’s death.  There <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span>, however, methods to safeguard a parent’s home while still trying to decrease the size of a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableestate.asp" target="_blank">taxable estate</a>, and these do not necessarily require a parent to lose control and suffer the same fate as this ninety-one year old.<!--more-->

The classic method is a life estate, where the parent retains the right to reside in the property for life and transfers the remainder to his or her heirs, or to a trust.  This technique is as old as <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/commonlaw.htm" target="_blank">English common law</a>. There are also two <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other</span> techniques, aside from a trust as commonly understood, that are covered by Treasury regulations and are accepted as mainstream by IRS and by the estate planning community. These are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_personal_residence_trust" target="_blank">Qualified Personal Residence Trust</a> (“QPRT”) and the Personal Residence Trust (“PRT”).  The QPRT and PRT are both designed to hold title to residences although each has its own advantages.  Moreover, in both cases, the donor-parent remains in the home for a defined period (referred to as the <em>initial term)</em>.

The disadvantage of a QPRT is that the donor’s death before the end of the <em>initial term</em> pulls the asset back into the taxable estate.  QPRTs are however more popular for several reasons.  A QPRT prohibits commutation during the donor’s <em>initial term</em>,<em> </em>thus protecting the parent’s occupancy.  A QPRT also provides certainty for planning purposes, because the planners know from the beginning how long the donor <em>must</em> survive in order for the asset not to be pulled back into his or her estate.  If the donor dies during the <em>initial term,</em> any credit used to offset the gift is restored<em>. </em> There is thus a benefit to a taxpayer in calculating the value of the gift that makes this technique attractive.

In contrast, the<em> initial term </em>of a PRT may be commuted, and a PRT is not prohibited from distributing to anyone other than the donor-parent, during its <em>initial term</em>.  This offers some flexibility if the donor’s health declines.  Some proponents used PRTs in anticipation of the repeal of the estate tax when transfer to the next generation would be triggered.  Some PRTs are created without the possibility of commutation for reasons of asset protection.

A parent (donor) may be the trustee of his or her QPRT or PRT.  This is especially important where the parent wants to remain in the home and maintain control but still engage in estate planning.  Thus, as you see, there are ways to engage in pre-mortem asset planning without running the risk of facing life on the street at ninety-one.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The IRS recently released its <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Releases-the-Dirty-Dozen-Tax-Scams-for-2012">“Dirty Dozen” report</a> – a list of the top twelve tax scams that taxpayers should avoid. Many of these scams are widespread and common in matters beyond tax, such as <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft" target="_blank">identity theft</a> and information phishing. However, some are peculiar to the tax field and are very common during this time of year as everyone scrambles to file their taxes before the April 17, 2012 filing deadline.

<a href="avoid-these-tax-scams"><img class="wp-image-904 alignright" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/taxes-300x199.jpg" alt="Photography by Celeste Cota" width="329" height="218" /></a>Of prime importance -- Beware of fraud by your tax return preparer. The IRS estimates that about 60% of tax filers will use a person or company to prepare their tax returns.  Fraud can occur when the tax payer skims money off of your tax return, charges exorbitant fees, or lies on your return to get you a guaranteed, higher refund.

To ensure that your tax return preparer is legitimate and not committing any fraud, for which you could be held criminally or civilly liable, always:
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the tax return preparer signs the return and places a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=251962,00.html" target="_blank">Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN)</a> on it</li>
<li>Make sure you obtain a copy of your tax return</li>
<li>Never pay a preparer a percentage of your refund as part of the preparation fee</li>
<li>Avoid preparers who guarantee you a specific dollar amount as a tax refund</li>
<li>Never, ever allow a tax preparer to include false information on your tax return</li>
</ul>

The case, <em>Tannen</em> <em>v</em>. <em>Tannen </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/collections/courts/appellate/%20a4211-07.opn.htm">http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/collections/courts/appellate/ a4211-07.opn.htm</a></span> is of interest for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the impact that changes in one area of law have upon another area. In this instance, a change in trust law impacts family law. Second, the case also demonstrates that trusts established many years ago may face challenges that were unanticipated at the time of the creation of wholly discretionary trusts.

The trial court had held that a beneficiary’s interest in a discretionary trust could be considered in calculating support available to the beneficiary and thereby reduce the non-beneficiary spouse’s alimony obligation. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/appdiv/index.htm" target="_blank">Appellate Division </a>overturned, noting that the Trial Court’s holding upset well-settled case law<strong>.</strong> The Supreme Court affirmed the Appellate Division decision for the reasons expressed in that Appellate Division opinion, and, significantly, without issuing its own opinion. The result is that the status quo is maintained, at least for now.<!--more-->

The facts are relatively clear-cut. The wife in this matrimonial action was the beneficiary of a trust where the trustee had complete discretion to make distribution for the beneficiary’s health, support, maintenance, education and general welfare. The trust instrument stated that the Trustee was permitted to consider other resources available to the beneficiary, and the Trustee could not be compelled by the beneficiary to distribute income or principal. The husband sought to have the income from this trust reduce his support obligation by being deemed available to the wife. In order to achieve this result, the husband needed to convince the trial court to use the<strong> </strong>revised guidance, contained in the <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em>. The revised guidance would deem the income from the trust available to the wife and thus reduce the husband’s alimony obligation.

The <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts</em> provides such<strong> </strong>guidance to interpret trust provisions and has been used by New Jersey courts in various cases over the years. The <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em> made changes to this, most notably in eliminating the distinction between a support and a discretionary trust. Thus, the <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em> gives a beneficiary a right to income from a discretionary trust as one where distributions to the beneficiary are mandatory. In <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tannen</span></em>, the trial court judge used the <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em> in holding that the beneficiary-wife had the right to income from the trust. The right to income was all that the trial judge needed to impute this income to her for purposes of the alimony calculation.

The Appellate Division declined to adopt the <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em>, stating that the dramatic impact that its adoption would have upon other areas of law should be left to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court similarly declined to take this opportunity to adopt the <em>Restatement (Third) of </em>Trusts. Thus, we are left with the status quo. Now is the time to plan for the future and review trust agreements that we once thought were impervious.

<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nj/PubArticleNJ.jsp?id=1202544625787&amp;slreturn=1"><em>Telebright Corporation, Inc. v.  Director, New Jersey Division of Taxation</em></a> (Docket No. A-5096-09T2) is relatively straightforward.  <a href="http://www.telebright.com/">Telebright Corporation, Inc.</a> (“ Telebright”), incorporated in Delaware, maintained offices in Maryland and none in New Jersey.  Telebright’s business consisted of a web application, which permitted employers to track employer-provided cell phones, manage accounts, and pay bills through the use of Telebright’s proprietary product.  The employee in question worked in Maryland before moving to New Jersey when her husband changed jobs.  Telebright allowed her to telecommute as she was a valued employee.  She signed an employment contract with a non-compete provision that restricted her future employment and prohibited her from disclosing Telebright’s proprietary information.  The contract permitted Telebright to seek injunctive relief.
<!--more-->

The employee wrote software code from her New Jersey home on her laptop.  When a task was completed, she would upload the work onto Telebright’s server in Maryland where other employees would deploy it.  She was supervised by a manager who tele-commuted from Boston.  She would visit the office in Maryland one or two times a year.  Telebright withheld New Jersey payroll taxes and paid the withholdings over to the state.  [No surprise how the matter was brought to the attention of the state taxing authority.]

The Tax Court agreed with the trial judge that Telebright was doing business in New Jersey because its New Jersey employee carried out the purpose of its organization by writing code that became part of the web-based service.  The court went on to state that Telebright could enforce its restrictive covenant against the employee in New Jersey courts and that the employee was entitled to the protections of New Jersey law.  This was sufficient for the court to hold that Telebright was doing business.

Suppose the employee was not writing code but worked in human resources or tax compliance.  I am curious if a non-revenue producing staff function would result in different treatment of Telebright.  For now, we should be examining telecommuting activity in light of the Telebright holding.]]></content>

Ms. Houston however elected to leave her entire estate to her daughter Bobbi Kristina via a testamentary trust (a trust that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">created</span> post-death).  Had Whitney chosen not to use the trust, Bobbi Kristina would have received one, lump sum distribution of the entire estate because she is 18 and thus legally an adult. However, the testamentary trust allows a named trustee to set a distribution plan so that Bobbi Kristina receives various distributions over the course of her life.

Whitney’s will serves as an important reminder to keep estate planning documents up-to-date, especially after major life events. Whitney’s will was created shortly after she married singer Bobby Brown and was never updated after their divorce.  Per the will, Bobby Brown is the suggested conservator should Bobbi Kristina ever be declared incompetent, which means he would control the assets Ms. Kristina receives from Whitney’s estate. Moreover, Whitney’s will states that if she had no children at the time of her death, Bobby Brown and several family members would split her estate. Given the bitter relationship between Whitney and Bobby Brown, it is doubtful that the will ultimately reflected her wishes. It should have been updated after her divorce.

I have taken an excerpt of a post that was made on our sister blog and have posted it below. It's a great discussion that ties Tax, Trusts and Estates  with  bankruptcy. Scarinci and Hollenbeck Partner, Joel R. Glucksman author of <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/" target="_blank">www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com</a>, explains in his post an interesting first of it's kind ruling in the circuit court level.

"The Fifth Circuit has held that inherited IRA funds are exempt from creditor distribution when the heir receiving those funds later files a bankruptcy.  The ruling legitimizes an important asset planning tool, allowing a wealthy parent to bequeath creditor-exempt assets to a financially troubled child without the fear that the child’s creditors might grab the funds.

In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txedce/4:2010cv00180/122133/15/">Chilton v. Moser</a> (In re Chilton)</span>, __ F.3d __ (5th Cir. 2012), the soon-to-be bankrupt Robert Chilton inherited $170,000 of IRA funds from the estate of his mother Shirley Heil.  When he thereafter filed a personal bankruptcy, he sought to keep the IRA funds from distribution to his creditors by using the Bankruptcy Code exemption for retirement funds.  The court agreed with him.<!--more-->

To begin with, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541">Bankruptcy Code §541</a> declares that, upon the commencement of the bankruptcy case, a legal entity known as the “bankruptcy estate” is created.  This is comprised of all of the debtor’s property interests, of all kinds and types, wherever located.  However, Bankruptcy Code §522 also lists a number of asset categories which do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> become part of the bankruptcy estate.  Such exempt assets are kept from distribution to the debtor’s creditors.  They are therefore retained by the debtor after the bankruptcy case is over, and the debts are discharged.  Notably, under Bankruptcy Code §522(d)(12), such assets include “retirement funds,” to the extent that they are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code..."

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/Lottery_Scarinci-Hollenbeck.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-974" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/Lottery_Scarinci-Hollenbeck-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>In <a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/DickersonMemo.TCM.WPD.pdf"><em>Dickerson v. Comm.</em>, TC Memo 2012-60</a>, The Tax Court has held that a taxpayer's transfer of her interest in a winning lottery ticket to a corporation 49% owned by her and 51% owned by family members resulted in a taxable gift because there was no enforceable contract to share the lottery prize with her family.

Tonda Dickerson worked as a waitress in an Alabama restaurant frequented by a customer who often made gifts of Florida lottery tickets to the workers of the establishment. On Mar. 7, 1999, a customer gave Tonda a winning lottery ticket with a cash payout amount of $5 million (over $10 million if paid out over 30 years). As with many families, Tonda's family was close-knit and generally had a sharing attitude. It had a tradition of buying lottery tickets and often talked about sharing a jackpot if a family member won “the big one.” In Tonda’s case, however, there was no written sharing agreement to share lottery winnings and she had no documentation to support its existence or terms.

On Mar. 8, 1999, a lawyer prepared incorporation papers for an S corporation called 9 Mill, in which Tonda had a 49% interest, and in which her mother and two siblings each held 17% interests. The percentages were determined by the head of the family, Tonda's father. The <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Articles+of+Incorporation">articles of incorporation</a> for 9 Mill were signed on Mar. 11, 1999.<!--more-->

On Mar. 9, Tonda learned of her co-workers' claim that she was obligated to share the prize with them under a pre-existing agreement to share lottery proceeds if any of them won. They claimed they were owed 80% of the total prize. On Mar. 12, Tonda and her family members went to Florida to collect on the ticket and Tonda, signing on 9 Mill's behalf, made an election to receive the lottery prize over 30 years. However, lottery officials would not pay out the prize because of the competing claim to the lottery ticket by Tonda's co-workers. In 1999, a state court found in favor of the co-workers, but later, the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm">Alabama Supreme Court</a> reversed and held for Tonda. While the claimants presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that an oral agreement existed, the Court held that under Alabama law, the agreement was unenforceable on public policy grounds because it was “founded on gambling consideration.”

In 2007, Tonda filed a gift tax return for 1999, but reported that no taxable gift had been made. On audit the IRS disagreed and claimed that she had made a gift of $2,412,388 as a result of her transfer of the lottery ticket to 9 Mill. It determined a gift tax deficiency of $771,570. IRS's argument was that Tonda's transfer of the lottery ticket to 9 Mill was an indirect gift to the extent that 51% of the shares were, at the time transfer of the lottery ticket took place, owned by her mother, brother, sister, and sister-in-law. On the other hand Tonda argued that no taxable gift occurred because at the time of the lottery ticket transfer there had previously existed and remained in effect a binding and enforceable contract under Alabama law requiring the transfer. Alternatively, she argued that the family members and Tonda were all members of an existing partnership under federal tax law which was the true owner of the lottery ticket or its proceeds.

The Tax Court agreed with the IRS and held that there was no enforceable contract to share the lottery prize among the members of Tonda's family. The “terms” of the so-called family agreement were too indefinite, uncertain, and incomplete, and consisted solely of offhand statements made throughout the years about sharing and taking care of one another if someone came into a substantial amount of money. This wasn't enough, said the Tax Court. There was no requirement that each family member buy lottery tickets, no pattern of buying, no pooling of money, and no predetermined sharing percentages. Additionally, the Tax Court held that the alleged agreement, even if otherwise enforceable under contract principles, would be rendered void under the Alabama antigambling statute.

The Tax Court also held that there weren't enough facts to indicate that a partnership existed among family members and that it was the owner of the gifted lottery ticket. There was no regular and consistent pattern of buying lottery tickets, and the decision of how the ticket proceeds should be split was made by Tonda's father, rather than jointly by all the family members.

Contrast this Tax Court decision with a prior IRS ruling regarding a sharing agreement. In PLR 9217004 two long-time companions (A&amp;B) were in the habit of buying lottery tickets with money taken from a pooled fund. One of the companions was in charge of disbursing the funds from the pool as circumstances arose. One of the tickets was a winner. The partner who was in charge of the funds signed the back of the ticket and kept charge of it. When the two went to claim the money, they were told that under state law the lottery proceeds could be paid to only one recipient.

Consequently, each party represented by independent legal counsel, executed a “Separate Ownership Agreement.” The agreement provides, in part:

1. Effective on and before December 2, 1988, B and A had agreed that each of them had an equal and separate interest in any and all proceeds that might result from the purchase of any and all lottery tickets by the parties from their joint funds.

2. The winning lottery ticket purchased December 2, 1988, at the convenience store was purchased with joint funds and B and A each have a separate and distinct interest in one-half of the proceeds and thus the proceeds of such lottery ticket shall be divided as follows:

A 50 percent

B 50 percent

3. The agreement appointed an “agreement manager” to receive the funds and disburse the funds to A and B.

The agreement was submitted to the Lottery Commission and, after the agreement was approved, the initial installment was paid to the agreement manager, in accordance with the Separate Ownership Agreement.

The IRS in its ruling noted that the parties intended and understood that from the time the ticket was purchased that each party equal interests in the ticket and the proceeds. They had made a practice of pooling all of their funds to cover the purchase of food and other necessities. In addition, they also used their pooled funds to purchase lottery tickets. This practice of pooling their funds had been on going for at least 9 months prior to the purchase of the ticket. The funds for the purchase of the ticket came from B's purse where A and B kept their pooled funds. B was aware at the time that the ticket was being purchased and specifically disbursed funds to A for the purpose of purchasing the ticket. A's transfer of possession of the ticket to B after it was ascertained that the ticket was a winning ticket and B's act of signing the ticket were consistent with the manner in which A and B had previously handled their finances; i.e., a pooling of resources, with B in possession of the couple's funds. The IRS noted that A and B viewed themselves as possessing equal ownership interests in the ticket from the inception.

In the technical advice, the Service ruled that the money obtained by the couple was owned jointly and the federal gift tax does not apply. In its ruling, the Service accepted the ruling by the state lottery commission that the “Separate Ownership Agreement” was legitimate and constituted a recognition of the joint ownership in the lottery ticket.

The “moral of the story” whether it is an office or family pool, is to form a partnership for the purpose of sharing in the cost and winnings of any lottery purchase endeavor or at least have a written sharing or ownership agreement coupled with a pattern of conduct to support such an agreement.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/whitney-houston-daughter.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-985" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/whitney-houston-daughter-291x300.jpg" width="122" height="126" /></a>The recent attention paid to the probate of the will of the late Whitney Houston is only a very small slice of a very complex estate.  The complexity is primarily due to certain assets that are part of the estate and must be valued for estate tax purposes.  How does one provide for the payment of death taxes paid if one has not attempted to establish values that will be respected by taxing authorities.  Planning, or the lack thereof, may not be an item to grab newspaper headlines but it is more important than an excerpt from a will.

<!--more-->

Although parts of Ms. Houston’s will were made public, we do not know whether Ms. Houston engaged in any significant business and estate planning prior to her passing.  We do not know, because trusts and business entities formed during a person’s lifetime are not usually identified in a will.

We suspect that this artist’s most valuable assets are the copyrights for her music, her appearances (concerts and film), and her name (likeness) (the “Artist’s Rights”).  Consider the catalogues of the collected works for the Beatles and the Beach Boys.  The market values of these catalogues substantially escalated over time, according to published reports. Moreover, if the experience of the Elvis Presley estate is any indication, the body of work of the late Michael Jackson is of immeasurable value.  These examples serve to drive up the value of Artist’s Rights. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to believe that Ms. Houston’s Artist’s Rights will be valued far in excess of the estate tax exclusion, currently $5,120,000.

How does the estate pay the taxes?  There are certain techniques for paying estate tax over a number of years that require planning in order for the estate to qualify under estate tax law.  We do not know if Ms. Houston made any transfers into a trust during her lifetime.  Such transfers prior to death would avoid the escalation in value that occurs upon the passing of a celebrity.

There are other nuances with copyright law and licensing that require a particular set of business skills to address.  It is not uncommon to have a specialist deal with the licensing and a different person act as trustee, in order to provide oversight.  More importantly, the skills of the specialist may not necessarily be the same ones needed by the trustee who is charged with caring for Ms. Houston’s daughter.  The specialist is charged with maximizing revenue, while the trustee is charged with preserving wealth and looking out for the overall well-being of a young adult.  These are different roles and that is why proper planning may assign them to different persons.

It would be worthwhile for an artist to engage in proper planning prior to death given the many variables faced by his or her estate, especially with respect to valuation that appears to escalate substantially at the artist’s death.  Such planning would establish a value for Artist’s Rights, provide liquidity or other lawful means for payment of taxes and plan for sound management of these assets.  Advance  planning is the only means to protect the surviving family members. May all artists’ have the wisdom to do so.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/taxes1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-994" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/03/taxes1-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>The failure to file your tax return on or before the <a href="http://www.efile.com/tax-day-deadlines/">due date</a>, or to pay the taxes that are due, can be very costly and in many cases double one’s <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed">tax liability</a>.

Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6651">IRC §6651(a)(1)</a>, the penalty for the late filing of a tax return is an additional 5% per month of the amount due, up to 25% in total.  In addition under IRC §6651(a)(2), the penalty for non payment of a tax is 0.5% per month (one-half of one percent cumulative) of the tax due, up to a total of 25%.  The penalties under both (a)(1) and (a)(2) are added, together, to the amount of tax owed unless a reasonable cause is shown as to why such a failure to comply occurred. That means that, in addition to the tax due, the taxpayer who has not filed a timely tax return or pay the tax due may be liable for an additional 50% in penalties. There are also other penalties such as <a href="http://tax.findlaw.com/tax-problems-audits/income-tax-fraud-vs-negligence.html">negligence, fraud</a>, and failure to pay estimated taxes that may increase the amount owed. Moreover interest on the unpaid taxes and penalties is calculated under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6601">IRC §6601</a> from the time the tax return is due until the date paid. The current underpayment interest rate is 3%. Consequently it does not take long for a taxpayer who has not filed his tax return or paid his tax to face paying an overwhelming tax bill.

<!--more-->

For many years the IRS has had relief programs to alleviate the burden of paying back taxes, penalties, and interest. These include installment payment programs and offers in compromise.

Recently in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IR 2012-13</span> the IRS has expanded its “Fresh Start” initiative to help struggling taxpayers by (1) providing late payment penalty relief to qualifying individuals, and (2) making streamlined installment agreements available to more taxpayers.

Under<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6159"> IRC §6159</a>, the IRS may enter into written agreements with any taxpayer. IRS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> enter into an installment agreement requested by an individual whose aggregate tax liability (without interest, penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts) isn't more than $10,000, and who hasn't failed to file or to pay income tax, or entered into another installment agreement, during any of the preceding five tax years, if the IRS determines that the taxpayer is financially unable to pay the liability in full when due (and the taxpayer submits information that IRS may require to make this determination). The agreement must require full payment within three years, and the taxpayer must agree to comply with all Code provisions while it's in effect.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Penalty Relief </span>

Under the Fresh Start program the IRS is now making available to certain wage earners and self-employed individuals a six-month grace period on failure-to-pay penalties. The request for an extension of time to pay will result in relief from the failure to pay penalty for tax year 2011 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only if the tax, interest and any other penalties are fully paid by Oct. 15, 2012</span>. Subject to income and balance due limits, the penalty relief applies for these two categories of taxpayers:
<ul>
<li>Wage earners who have been unemployed at least 30 consecutive days during 2011 or in 2012 up to the April 17 deadline for filing a federal tax return this year, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Self-employed individuals who experienced a 25% or greater reduction in business income in 2011 due to the economy.</li>
</ul>
A taxpayer's income must not exceed $100,000 if he or she files as single or head of household ($200,000 for joint filers). The penalty relief is not available to taxpayers whose calendar year 2011 balance due exceeds $50,000.

To obtain relief the taxpayer must file Form 1127-A, <em>Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Income Tax for 2011 Due to Undue Hardship.</em>

Those qualifying for relief will avoid the penalty until Oct. 15, 2012. Notwithstanding however, the IRS will charge interest on the unpaid taxes.

You are reminded to file your return on time by Apr. 17 or file for an extension because the relief does not extend to the failure to file penalty.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Taxpayers May Use Streamlined Installment Agreements (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/irswatch/2012/03/11/irs-offers-new-penalty-relief-and-expanded-installment-agreements-to-taxpayers/2/">See article</a>) </span>

One additional point: The IRS has raised the threshold for using an installment agreement without having to supply IRS with a financial statement from $25,000 to $50,000. This means that taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 in back taxes may enter into a streamlined agreement with IRS that stretches the payment out over a series of months or years. IRS also has raised the maximum term for streamlined installment agreements to 72 months from the preexisting 60-month maximum. These installment agreements can be entered into over the telephone with a IRS representative.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/03/20/another-state-death-tax-kicks-the-bucket-will-more-fall/">Forbes reports</a> that after Indiana's recent repeal of its death tax, 22 states plus the District of Columbia still have some form of estate or inheritance taxes. However, many of those states - such as Ohio, North Carolina and Illinois - have made moves to raise their exemptions or otherwise limit its impact.

<!--more-->

"Once a few states get rid of the death tax, it becomes an argument in other states in terms of being competitive," <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/palmer-schoening/34/830/7b5">Palmer Schoening</a>, director of federal affairs for the American Family Business Institute, told the news source. "Capital is really mobile, and people are too."

New Jersey tax law, on the other hand, has stayed in the opposite direction, as it has both estate and inheritance taxes on the state level. Only Maryland also has both taxes in place.

Analysts have said that high estate or inheritance taxes could drive many families away from the state unless changes are made.

"There's a huge amount of baby boomers who will be retiring in the coming years," <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/chris-edwards">Chris Edwards</a>, Director of Tax Policy for the conservative <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>, told Reuters last summer. "States shoot themselves in the foot if they scare away their higher income retirees. With the internet and cheap air fare, they're more mobile than ever."

Governor Chris Christie has spoken out, saying in his budget address last year that New Jersey estate law was hurting the state and pushing for the state's exemption to be raised to $1 million. However, that proposal was met with stiff opposition.

The case involved a Maryland software company called <a href="http://www.telebright.com/">Telebright</a>. The company had an employee who started working at the company's headquarters in Maryland, but then moved to New Jersey and telecommuted full-time. (<a title="CPAs and Taxpayers Beware:  Employee Telecommuting Is Doing Business In New Jersey For Purposes of Taxation" href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/cpas-and-taxpayers-beware-employee-telecommuting-is-doing-business-in-new-jersey-for-purposes-of-taxation/">Read our previous post here</a>)

The state's <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/corp_over.shtml">Corporation Business Tax</a> specifies that all companies that do business in the state are subject to the tax, and comprehensively defines doing business in the state as "all activities which occupy the time or labor of men for profit." Because of that, Telebright's one remote New Jersey worker left the company liable for New Jersey business taxes.

Analysis from <a href="http://www.cfo.com/magazine/">CFO Magazine</a> said that the ruling essentially viewed telecommuting workers contributing to larger projects in the same light as someone making physical parts for a product that will be assembled somewhere else.

While the ruling specifically dealt with the enforcement of New Jersey tax law, close wording also exists in the regulations created by other states. For example, New York business law contains very similar language, stating that foreign corporations must pay a franchise tax if they do business, employ capital, own or lease property or have an office in the state.

Adding even more complications, the situation may also create tax compliance problems for businesses that they may not be aware of until much later.

In some cases, it's possible employees who regularly telecommute may not notify the company if they move to another state on either a temporary or permanent basis, creating tax liabilities in that state without knowing it. Once the situation has been discovered, companies would need to go backward to determine their specific tax liabilities for that remote worker.

		<content><![CDATA[The real estate market, in severe decline over the last few years, has shown signs of life recently. Naturally, the supervising government agencies, lenders, and loan brokers are sensitive to avoiding the mistakes of the past and have implemented new requirements to prevent any repeat of errors.  Here are two new items that have come to light.

<a href="comfort-letters-rent-insurance-and-mortgages"><img class="wp-image-1020 alignright" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/Real-Estate-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="136" /></a><strong>1)</strong><strong>  Comfort Letters.  </strong>Lenders and loan brokers are requesting “<a href="http://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/privatecompaniespracticesection/pages/pcps.aspx">comfort letters</a>” from accountants in connection with loan applications of individuals. This focuses upon the most common accountant-client relationship, where the preparation of an individual income tax return is the only service involved. In furtherance of this service, the accountant sends a questionnaire that is completed by the client and returned along with Forms W-2 and 1099.  The accountant does not audit or verify the information.  One state accountancy board has taken the position that the issuance of such a letter is an attestation service that requires certain accounting procedures to be followed.  The <a href="http://www.njscpa.org/">New Jersey Society</a> recommends that the accountant contact his or her insurance carrier before making a decision on whether or not to reply.  Accountants are told by clients and lenders that the loan will not be approved without the Comfort Letter.  I am also advised that the accountants are being instructed on what language the letter must contain.  An individual borrower would be wise to inquire of the lender or loan broker whether a comfort letter will be required of his accountant before paying an application fee.

<strong>2)  Rent Insurance &amp; Mortgages.</strong>  The second issue that has come to our attention is rather odd. A lender, refinancing its purchase money mortgage for a condominium located in a New Jersey beach community, insisted that the mortgage include a 1-4 multi-family rider. The inconsistency is that the rider requires the homeowner to obtain rent insurance for its vacation home.  I am assured that rent insurance is not available where the second home is occupied by the owner-mortgagor.  What makes this interesting is that the Second Home Rider absolutely prohibits rental to a third party for the life of the loan. Upon executing the Mortgage that includes these two riders, the owner agrees not to rent the condominium and to only use it as a second home while immediately obtaining rent insurance for the tenant he cannot have.  The lender blamed the investor, that is the government, for this requirement and insisted that it will not enforce the requirement that rent insurance be obtained.  The lender will not respond to the question as to whether it can bind the investor.

If these items are any indication, the transition to a more vibrant market will be bumpy.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Business valuations are an important component of operating a company, especially for owners who plan to sell or merge with another business in the future. However, some small business owners who do not plan on making significant changes to their company may forgo valuations, which can have heavy implications for their estate planning.

<a href="knowing-a-companys-value-is-crucial-to-estate-planning"><img class="wp-image-1034 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/Glasses-on-Document_Scarinci-Hollenbeck-300x260.jpg" width="270" height="234" /></a>Currently, only 43 percent of business owners who hire a valuation expert do so for <a title="Estate Planning Resolutions for the New Year" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-planning-resolutions-for-the-new-year/">estate planning</a> purposes, according to a survey from TEC Worldwide. In addition, many who do value their companies may rely on professionals who are unqualified to conduct these valuations, such as certified public accountants, because they do not take into account all the factors that weigh on a company's worth. Experts say the percentage of owners who conduct valuations is too low, which may lead to issues for the owner's beneficiaries down the road for several reasons.

<!--more-->

First, when a business owner dies, the IRS usually conducts an audit of the company's tax returns and records to ensure taxes are collected on the fair market value of the business, and that the terms of the final will and testament comply with federal estate law.

Company owners who choose to transfer businesses to heirs so they can enter into retirement may also experience problems if they fail to value their business first, according to valuation firm <a href="http://www.tax-val.com/tax-val.aspx?MyMenu=home&amp;MyPage=ourfirm.asp&amp;SessionID=62909128">AIW</a>.

For example, transfers of ownership that are valued below fair market value may prompt the IRS to determine that taxes are owed. In addition, the tax agency may also enforce a penalty of up to 40 percent of the unpaid taxes, AIW reports.

For these reasons, small business owners who plan on keeping the company in the family may put their heirs - and their company - in a better financial position by having the enterprise valued by a valuation professional to avoid potential tax issues in the future.

		<content><![CDATA[Employers may be paying closer attention to how they classify workers in light of new state statutes that are being adopted in many areas of the country.

<a href="new-laws-clamp-down-on-employee-misclassifications"><img class="wp-image-1053 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/hand-doing-paperwork-300x194.jpg" width="300" height="194" /></a>Business owners who misclassify employees as <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/tax-issues-that-impact-your-wealth-part-vii-independent-contractor-2-of-2">independent contractors</a> may now be subject to harsher penalties, according to the Washington Post. Independent contractors are typically workers who operate their business with their own resources and determine their own schedules, according to the <a href="http://www.irs.gov">Internal Revenue Service</a>. However, when employees telecommute or have unconventional schedules and responsibilities, the lines can be blurred.

<!--more-->

Over the course of the year, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">U.S. Department of Labor</a>, along with several states, discovered several instances of employers misclassifying employees as independent contractors, the Post reports.

Employers who categorize workers as independent contractors rather than regular employees benefit from the tax law structure surrounding contractors, namely because they are not required to pay unemployment compensation, Social Security and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/litigation/workers-compensation/">worker's compensation</a>. In addition, they are not required to extend employee benefits to contractors, such as health insurance, paid vacation and sick days and retirement programs.

However, as more employers appear to misclassify their workers, states that are facing financial shortfalls and declining revenues are being negatively impacted by the practice, and have implemented tough laws to curb the issue. In some states, such as Maryland, new laws have been established to expand workers' rights, one of which requires employers to pay restitution to miscategorized employees, the Post reports.

In states such as New Jersey, penalties of up to $2,500 can be levied for first time offenses, and climb to a maximum of $5,000 for repeat offenses, according to the <a href="http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/">New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development</a>. There are several factors laid out by the IRS that employers may use to classify workers. However, as many of these financial and behavioral indicators can be ambiguous, employers will need to be more careful about how they categorize their human resources.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[One of the most common estate planning techniques is the use of a trust to hold a life insurance policy, sometimes referred to as an ILIT.  An ILIT, containing the proceeds of life insurance (that is, the death benefit), will not be included in a decedent’s estate if it is properly structured.  The ability to exclude the death benefit from the taxable estate is of immeasurable benefit not only because of the tax savings but also because it creates a certain level of creditor protection.  The ILIT may also provide the estate with liquidity by loaning it money or purchasing assets.   Finally, the ILIT may provide an inheritance for those heirs who are not involved in and will not inherit the family business.

<!--more-->

<a href="transfer-of-insurance-policy-held-in-a-grantor-trust"><img class="size-full wp-image-1066 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/insurance.jpg" width="220" height="229" /></a>One assumes all will continue to be right with the world after the ILIT is created. Unfortunately, plans change as couples divorce and businesses fail or are sold.  When plans change, advisors are often asked to adapt the plan to the change in circumstances, and sometimes that means unlocking the ILIT.  The very provisions that prevented inclusion of the proceeds in the estate of the insured also limit what the insured can do to control or transfer the policy.  Proper design precludes the insured from holding any <em>incidence of ownership</em> over life insurance causing inclusion under <a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/1995/SEP95/f500995.htm">IRC §2042</a>, such as the ability to change beneficiaries. Proper design prevents an insured or spouse from having a <em>retained power</em> of enjoyment over the policy causing inclusion under IRC §2036 or IRC §2038.

There are also income tax rules which, if violated, convert the death benefit that is otherwise tax-free into ordinary income.  How then does one unlock the policy from the ILIT and avoid creating income in the face of these rules?

One of the most useful tools in the tax toolbox is the grantor trust.  A transaction between a grantor and his or her grantor trust are ignored for income tax purposes. These rules, if properly used, prevent the conversion of a tax-free death benefit into ordinary income.  The other part of the problem is resolved by <a href="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2011-49_IRB/ar02.html">Rev. Rul. 2011-28</a> which permits the insured to substitute assets of equivalent value in exchange for the life insurance policy.  Mere possession of such a power will not cause inclusion of the ILIT in the insured’s estate.

There are a number of design (drafting) issues that are not discussed but the ruling is helpful in that it approves what practitioners believe to be reasonable and possible.]]></content>

<a href="business-owners-urged-to-choose-trustees-carefully"><img class="wp-image-1074 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/hand-doing-paperwork1-300x194.jpg" width="270" height="175" /></a>When it comes to setting up a trustee, business owners should be fully informed about the potential pitfalls of relying on an inexperienced individual, such as a friend or family member, versus a corporate trustee that may be more equipped to navigate the complex process of transferring business assets. Because there are several types of trusts and financial arrangements available, each with different trustee stipulations and responsibilities, choosing a trustee with strong financial and business knowledge may be in a company owner's best interest.

<!--more-->

A recent <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/pages/index.aspx">CFA Institute</a> report noted that corporate trustees are better prepared to understand and address the risk and liability issues that go into setting up and executing a trust. This can help mitigate potential lawsuits and beneficiary disputes in the future.

In addition, independent trustees may be in a better position to manage the complex recordkeeping responsibilities that are associated with some trusts. Consistent accounting and proper documentation is a routine aspect of a trustee's responsibilities, and failing to keep up-to-date and organized records could result in legal actions and challenges to investments and distributions, according to the CFA Institute.

Further, the correct distribution of income and choice of sound investments is imperative for business owners who set up a trust as part of their business succession planning. A lack of understanding about investment decisions and holdings can have significant business consequences if the trust is in inexperienced hands, which may jeopardize a company and have a negative impact on beneficiaries.]]></content>

New Jersey has <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillypharma/147133935.html">agreed</a> to provide Teva with a $15 million tax credit if signs a contract to build the projected $73 million facility in Florham Park, New Jersey and create 215 jobs in the state, according to the New Jersey Star-Ledger. The job openings would supplement the 300 employees who are currently working in New Jersey at Teva, which is the country's largest manufacturer of generic medications.

<!--more-->

The initiative of providing tax incentives for businesses is part of the Grow New Jersey program, whose tax law provisions allow companies that make capital investments of at least $20 million to receive a credit, the newspaper reports. In addition, companies must create at least 100 new jobs or retain 100 employees to be eligible for the benefit.

The contract would provide significant <a href="http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2012/04/four_economic_development_proj.html">economic advantages</a> to New Jersey given the size and reach of the company. Teva produces one out of every six of the 2.6 billion generic prescriptions filled in the United States each year, according to the company website. The company is headquartered in Pennsylvania, but retains nearly 8,000 employees in 30 facilities across the United States.

If Teva agrees to build the facility in New Jersey, it would consolidate parts of its operations currently based in California, New York and New Jersey, the news source reports. The drug maker has six months to decide if it will agree to the contract.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A recently-enacted New Jersey property law may result in revenue losses totaling between $64 and $94 million dollars, according to an industry study.

<a href="new-jersey-sales-tax-revenue-losses-fall-between-64-94-million-due-to-gift-card-law"><img class=" wp-image-1089 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/Gift-Card.jpg" width="280" height="180" /></a>New Jersey recently implemented a law that allows the state to seize the value of unredeemed gift cards if consumers do not make purchases within a two-year period after purchase. As a result, many providers including American Express, InComm and Blackhawk Network announced that they may discontinue operations in New Jersey.

<!--more-->

"While our main concern is the negative impact this law will have on retailers and consumers in New Jersey, and we are fearful many more businesses will make the extremely difficult decision to no longer operate in the state, what is also becoming clear is the significant, negative fiscal impact this will have on state revenue," said <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rebekkarea">Rebekka Rea</a>, executive director of the <a href="http://www.thergca.org/">Retail Gift Card Association</a>.

The <a href="http://www.njrma.org/">New Jersey Retail Merchants Association</a> and Retail Gift Card Association recently released an analysis showing that annual revenue losses from sales taxes and retail sales will have a negative effect on the state's economy, which may worsen if financial service providers continue to cancel operations as a result of the property law.

"This law comes at simply too great of a cost for businesses to comply, now it appears that this law may also come at too great of a cost for the state to implement," said <a href="http://www.njrma.org/contact.html">John Holub</a>, president of the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association. "This analysis clearly shows that retailers and consumers are not the only ones being negatively impacted by this law."

Small businesses have been steadily impacted by New Jersey tax law and revenue-raising programs, such as the Grow New Jersey initiative, that are designed to boost the state's economy overcome budget shortfalls. Many small businesses have voiced their opposition to certain provisions state revenue programs, which some say give certain businesses, such as online retailers, unfair tax advantages.]]></content>

While trusts have long been one strategy to ensure a smooth business transition to younger generations, experts say that more owners are relying upon them to pass businesses down earlier than in previous years and better support their tax planning initiatives, according to the <a href="http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/">North Bay Business Journal</a>.

<!--more-->

Because there are a variety of trusts to choose from, many business owners are becoming more selective about the vehicles they pick, often turning toward those that allow them to have a stake in the company after passing on ownership to prop up the value of business. These "intentionally defective grantor trusts" also give business owners more time and authority to cultivate the beneficiary's handling of a company once they are gifted over to heirs, while at the same time retaining control of the business assets, the news source explains.

Trust law provisions for this type of succession plan also provide tax benefits that allow the owner to continue paying taxes on business assets, a move that protects beneficiaries from being overburdened by taxes and increases the benefit of the gift. Further, owners who take on the tax burden are also enabled to remove those funds from their estates, which are likely to be taxed at a higher rate than that of their beneficiaries.

Lastly, experts say that transferring ownership while an heir is still young allows the business to appreciate in value over time within the trust itself, which also has less of an impact on the business owner's lifetime gift tax exemption.]]></content>

In 93 percent of cases, a small change in behavior could have prevented the fatal accident, said Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at Toronto University. His research showed that the number of pedestrians and passenger fatalities also rise on tax day.

The study gathered tax deadline data from the IRS and fatal road crash data from the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> for the past three decades (1980-2009). It then compared the number of fatalities with a control day one week before the filing deadline and another control day one week after. The research showed that there were 226 fatal crashes for each of the 30 tax days and 213 fatal accidents for each of the 60 control days.

Redelmeier said drivers who are stressed should remember to buckle their seat belts, obey the speed limit, avoid alcohol, minimize distractions and refrain from driving recklessly.

Despite the advent of the Internet and <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Filing">e-filing</a>, the study showed an increase rather than a decrease in fatal crashes in recent decades. Asked about this finding, Redelmeier said, "Electronic filing might have inadvertently caused people to leave things to the last minute."

The risk of a fatal accident does not depend on the time of day, Redelmeier said, noting that risk "does not increase just before the deadline."

The Filing deadline this year is Tuesday, April 17<sup>th</sup>; perhaps filing it on Monday the 16<sup>th</sup> might just prevent an accident!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Federal tax law draws defining lines between employees and <a title="Tips on Independent Contractor Tax Compliance" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/tips-on-independent-contractor-tax-compliance/">independent contractors</a>, but these boundaries can blur at times, and misinterpreting them can have negative implications for employers. Three tests are typically used to define a worker's status for tax purposes: Behavior, financial and relationship tests.

<a href="avoid-mixing-up-a-w-2-employee-and-1099-contract-worker"><img class=" wp-image-1053 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/04/hand-doing-paperwork-300x194.jpg" width="240" height="155" /></a>In terms of behavior, independent <a title="Tax Issues That Impact Your Wealth, Part VI: Independent Contractor" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/2012/03/02/tax-issues-that-impact-your-wealth-part-vi-independent-contractor/">contractors</a> typically make their own schedules, work on a deadline, provide their own supplies and have more discretion over how a task is completed. Independent contractors are also given more financial control, as they do not work for periodic wages and can take on multiple clients. Employees, in contrast, are typically banned from soliciting work from other clients and are subject to the wage structure their company imposes.

Lastly, the relationship between employers and contractors is more detached than those of workers, in that the former does not receive benefits and works on specific projects typically for a predetermined amount of time. Further, they must generally carry out the task to satisfy the terms of their contract before they quit a job, should they decide to do so.

While certain work scenarios can make determining a worker's status difficult, IRS implications can be heavy for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2010/10/15/criminal-penalties-for-misclassifying-independent-contractors/">employers who misclassify employees</a> and contractors who claim certain job-related deductions. Due to the tax gap between taxes owed and taxes that are actually paid, business owners are facing more scrutiny from the IRS. Employers may be held accountable for unpaid withholding taxes and benefits, as well as a 100 percent penalty for failure to collect and account for employment taxes.

Independent contractors are solely responsible for paying their share of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, as well as that of the employer's. Further, misclassified independent contractors who claim home office deductions due to telecommuting privileges can also trigger an audit and face tax penalties.]]></content>

Officials allege that Sprint has underpaid and under-collected roughly $100 million in state and local taxes on flat-rate access charges for wireless plans. In addition, officials say that the debt to New York increases by nearly $210,000 each week. Under the state's tax law, the company may be forced to pay out three times more than it owes in penalties if found guilty.

<!--more-->

A whistleblower, who has not been named, tipped officials off to Sprint's alleged tax fraud, but the company has said the accusations are "without merit," according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/">Los Angeles Times</a>. The company argues that the state should only tax calls included on flat-rate plans that are made and end within the state of New York.

"We have collected and paid over to New York every penny of sales taxes on mobile wireless services that we believe our customers owe under New York state law," the company said in a statement. "We intend to stand up for New York consumers' rights and fight this suit."

However, the state says the company is responsible for all monthly charges, noting that all other cellphone carriers have complied with this law. In addition, officials allege that Sprint "repeatedly and knowingly submitted false records and statements" and used this practice to gain an unfair advantage over its competitors by marketing its calling plans as more affordable.

The lawsuit will be the first of its kind under <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/law/html/fca/fca.shtml">New York's False Claims Act</a>, according to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/">ABC News</a>. Under the program, whistleblowers are also entitled to up to 25 percent of the funds recovered by tax agencies.]]></content>

<a href="http://westmilford.org/">West Milford</a> is filing a tax appeal against telecom giant <a href="http://aboutus.verizonwireless.com/aboutusoverview.html">Verizon</a> for $194,000 in unpaid taxes, which the company says it does not owe due to a New Jersey tax law provision that exempts telecommunications agencies that do not hold a majority presence from paying taxes, according to <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/new-jersey-town-takes-verizon-to-court-for-unpaid-taxes/">NorthJersey.com</a>. The company began its tax rescission strategy in 2008, and contacted 31 towns in New Jersey to inform them that the company would stop paying business property tax payments under the statute.

<!--more-->

When asked by other municipalities in 2010, such as <a href="http://www.riverdalenj.gov/">Riverdale</a>, to demonstrate it does not hold a majority presence, the company was unable to do so, noting that it was unable to release customer names and exchanges.

The company also faces penalties totaling $100 per day for not completing a PT-10 form that is necessary for identifying exchange company equipment for tax reasons, the newspaper explains.

The tax appeal is expected to not only help local municipalities recoup lost taxes, but also challenge Verizon's interpretation of the statute and set a legal precedent that would help towns collect taxes if they fall outside this provision. However, the news source reports that this statute has been relied on and been effective in other states as well, including Ohio and Virginia.

Given the evolution of mobile technology in recent years, analysts say that the outcome of the case may help lawmakers reinterpret the old statute and expand current tax laws to take the new technology into account.]]></content>

Negotiations over the sales price of a business are often difficult, because there is always risk that the enterprise will not perform <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> the sale as it has in the past.   In the context of a typical, closely-held business, the proceeds of sale represent a significant portion of the owner’s retirement fund and the owner does not want to sell too cheaply. The buyer, on the other hand, is concerned that the best days of the target business are behind it, and that he or she is overpaying.  A contingent sales price is one means of bridging the gap in price between the positions of buyer and seller.

<!--more-->

There are three categories of contingent payments. The first is where a maximum sales price is determinable.  The second is where the maximum selling price is not determinable, but the period over which payments will be received is fixed. The last category is where there is neither a maximum price nor a definite term.  The buyer may then negotiate a cap on the earn-out while the seller may want a make-up provision that would permit the unused cap to carry forward to subsequent years.

What is sometimes overlooked in negotiations is that the seller’s basis (or tax cost) is recovered differently in each of these scenarios, because the profit percentage that is applied to each payment is different for each method.  Although a seller may want a large cap or upside, an unattainable figure will cause more harm. A large unrealistic cap will require that the seller recognize more income in the earlier years and will result in a capital loss at the end of the term.  This is because the profit percentage is overstated.

A seller should be aware of how basis is recovered under each proposal that is presented.  It is to the seller’s benefit to recover more basis in the earlier years of the payout period because this results in reporting less income.  Where the cap is exceedingly high and unrealistic, a taxpayer may be forced to apply for a private letter ruling to obtain relief from these distortions that occur when the profit percentage is overstated.]]></content>

The current <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/retirement/estate-planning/start-giving-it-away-early-8005/">$5.12 million gift tax exemption</a> will expire at the end of the year and revert to $1 million in 2013, giving business owners a small time frame in which to pass on assets that are expected to appreciate in value before the changes go into effect. In addition, the 35 percent tax rate attached to federal estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes is expected to rise to the top rate of 55 percent.

<!--more-->

One of the most common actions business owners are taking is making the lifetime gift of $5.12 million - or $10.24 million for married couples - to reduce their estates by the gifted amount and the appreciation of the gift over time. Lifetime gifts can be made in the form of business interests, real estate, assets and securities.

However, business owners are also taking advantage of trust options to transfer wealth to successors as a strategy for avoiding estate and gift taxes. Grantor retained annuity trusts are emerging as a popular option in that they allow business owners to retain control of business assets and income for a specific number of years before transferring the company over to heirs.

Longtime business owners are employing dynasty trusts to allow the assets in the trust to pass from generation to generation indefinitely free of estate taxes. The trust is an appealing estate planning option for businesses that undergo a great deal of change frequently, in that future generations are free from GST and estate taxes, but still enabled to make changes to the terms of the trust.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Despite scheduled changes to estate and tax law in 2013, new data shows that not enough small <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">businesses</a> are enacting succession planning strategies and may be putting their companies in danger.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/strategy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1161 alignright" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/strategy-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>Small companies and family-owned businesses make up between 80 and 90 percent of companies in the United States, and employ 62 percent of the workforce. In addition, small companies fuel roughly 64 percent of the country's gross domestic product. However, statistics from the <a href="http://www.familybusinessinstitute.com/">Family Business Institute</a> reveal only 30 percent of family businesses survive into the second generation, and only 12 percent are still viable by the third, as a result of failed succession planning.

<!--more-->

Further, only two-thirds of family business owners report having an accurate understanding of how much they may owe in estate taxes, and one in five owners admit to having no estate tax planning strategies in place, the institute noted.

Business owners also revealed the most common issues associated with developing a succession plan, including leaving the company to a surviving spouse, rather than younger beneficiaries, and creating a plan that would treat multiple children equally. Other smaller businesses often cite being too wrapped up in the day-to-day operations to plan for the future, University of Pittsburgh Small Business Development Center director Ray Vargo told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Further, experts say that business owners who were proactive about building and growing a company from the ground up may face succession issues if their children and heirs lack the managerial experience or will to keep operations going, the newspaper explains.

Because of these common obstacles, experts say that developing a succession plan early on that emphasizes the financial and tax aspects of transferring a company, as well as cultivating heirs to take on leadership roles, is a crucial element in keeping a company running.]]></content>

Commissioner, T.C. Memo 2012-88</a>.  The Court in <em>Wandry</em> held that a taxpayer may use a defined value gift clause (“<a href="http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/172856/Personal+Tax+Inheritance+Estate+Planning/Tax+Court+Upholds+Defined+Value+Gift+Formula+Clause">DVGC</a>”) to make a gift expressed in terms of a dollar figure rather than as a specified number of units of property (e.g., $10,000 of XYZ stock).  A DVGC protects a taxpayer against an increase in estate or gift tax as the result of a tax audit.

<!--more-->

The government has litigated successfully against DVGC’s since 1944; see for example, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11358784073877759126&amp;q=Commissioner+v.+Procter,+142&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31&amp;as_vis=1">Commissioner v. Procter</a></span>, 142 F.2d 824 (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1944).  The clause in <em>Procter</em> provided that any part of the transfer that because subject to gift tax because of IRS revaluation should be returned to the donor and should not be deemed to be part of the gift.  The Court held that taking back property (a “condition subsequent”) to avoid taxation violated public policy.

Although, <em>Wandry</em> is the fifth taxpayer victory in the DVGC area, it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first</span> case where the excess gift did not pass to a charity. Three of the taxpayer victories were won in Courts of Appeal in the Fifth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits. These taxpayers avoided the <em>Procter</em> rule by having the increase in value, resulting from an audit adjustment, pass to a charity and qualify for a charitable deduction rather than go back to the donor.

<strong>In <em>Wandry</em>, the<em> parents transferred property to a limited liability company (LLC) and caused the LLC to be appraised. Then, the parents assigned a sufficient number of LLC units (percentage interests) so the fair market value of the units equaled the dollar amount of the gift next to the child’s name.  The parents filed gift tax returns using units rather than dollar values.  The court held for the taxpayers stating that the gift  was of the stated dollar amount rather than percentages (units) of the LLC.</em></strong>

There are different types of DVGC’s, such as formula transfer clause and formula allocation clause, each replete with nuances. Although use of DVGC’s is beneficial, it raises a number of other issues that and require careful planning. One such issue is the income tax consequences of an audit that changes the number of units of property transferred.

<em>Wandry</em> offers a type of insurance against revaluation upon audit, especially in the context of family limited partnerships and should prove useful to taxpayers.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Business owners who drafted their estate planning months ago to prepare for the estate and tax law changes that will take effect in 2013 may have adopted a "set it and forget it" mentality. However, one of the most significant and potentially harmful results of filing away an estate plan too early is failing to account for personal or company changes that may occur in 2012.

<a href="accounting-for-personal-changes-during-estate-planning"><img class=" wp-image-1177 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/binoculars-200x300.jpg" width="160" height="240" /></a>Any number of financial circumstances that may occur can derail an estate plan if they are not addressed before the year's end, according to the <a href="http://columbiabusinesstimes.com/">Columbia Business Times</a>. The most immediate changes involve births, deaths, marriages and divorces that have occurred or are likely to occur over the course of the year. This may prompt changes in succession plans and business trust arrangements.

<!--more-->

In addition, changes in a company's status will also weigh heavily on an owner's estate plans. Retirement and selling off business assets will undoubtedly have an impact, but owners must also pay close attention to mergers and developing new business entities, the news source explains. New business arrangements can dictate what owners can leave to beneficiaries and have a profound effect on succession planning.

Lastly, changes in a business owner's financial status due to asset appreciation, inheritances and income should be accounted for in the form of an updated estate plan. Oftentimes, owners may fail to monitor the growth in savings and other assets over time, which can lead to tax surprises once new estate laws go into effect.

The current estate tax exemption sits at $5.12 million; however, this amount is expected to fall to $1 million for both estate and tax exemptions in 2013. For this reason, estate and tax planning is critical this year, and businesses can navigate around any uncertainty by closely monitoring and updating their estate plans.]]></content>

In July 2010, James and Theresa DeMuro, who owned and managed engineering firm TAD Associates LLC, were each indicted on one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and 21 counts of willfully failing to account for and turn over employment taxes, according to the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nj/index.jsp">New Jersey Law Journal</a>. The couple received repeated warnings from the IRS between 2002 and 2008 that they may be held personally liable under tax law for the $546,242 they withheld from employee paychecks for Social Security, Medicaid and income taxes, but never turned over to the government.

<!--more-->

In 2003, the IRS imposed penalties on the couple and required them to make monthly, rather than quarterly, payments of employment taxes. Further, the IRS set up a special trust for the company that the DeMuros were required to pay into. The couple then made frequent withdrawals from the account to cover non-business expenses and closed out the account without IRS permission, the law journal explained.

In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13730504972517261745&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">U.S. v. DeMuro</a>, prosecutors countered the DeMuros' arguments that their failure to pay employment taxes was not willful by introducing evidence showing the DeMuros spent approximately $5,043,867 on lavish vacations abroad, vacation homes, vehicles, parties and home shopping network purchases during the period they failed to pay employment taxes. Following their conviction in 2010, the DeMuros appealed the decision, arguing their personal spending was irrelevant to their case.

The presiding judges relied on previous cases, U.S. v. Ellis and U.S. v. Blanchard, to rule that lavish personal spending can directly tie into a defendant's case of willfully failing to meet their tax obligations.

District Judge John Padova, who sat on the appeals panel, offered the opinion that evidence of the DeMuro's lavish spending on personal items "that they could have used to pay their taxes belies their assertions that they were sincerely attempting to pay back their taxes as expeditiously as possible."]]></content>

The Court ruled in favor of Home Concrete and Supply LLC after the IRS took roughly six years to launch an audit against the company for a Son of Boss tax shelter.

<!--more-->

The case revolved around the sale of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-139.htm">Home Oil and Coal Co</a>., which had been sold in 1999 by its two shareholders, Robert Piece and Steven Chandler. The shareholders filed their 1999 taxes in 2000, and the IRS audited them in 2006 after determining that they used a pass-through company to increase their cost basis when filing. After the sale was finalized, the shareholders had just a $69,000 capital gain on a $10 million sale.

The IRS argued that an extended six-year time period to audit the company was warranted based on several lower court interpretations of tax law. The tax agency also noted that an extended time period to bill businesses for unpaid taxes was authorized when the amount exceeds 25 percent of their gross income. However, the Supreme Court disagreed and ruled the IRS was confined to the three-year deadline, setting the record straight after years of mixed lower court decisions and creating a significant precedent for business taxpayers.

Son of boss (bond and option sales strategy) tax shelters function by inflating the cost basis of an asset to avoid paying higher capital gains taxes. The IRS has historically gone after these shelters for tax evasion and been successful in many cases, sometimes recouping billions of dollars in taxes, interest and penalties.

The ruling is expected to impact several similar pending cases amounting to roughly $1 billion in taxes that are currently being argued in courtrooms across the country.]]></content>

By way of background, there are two types of powers of appointment.  The first is a general power of appointment (“GPA”) which permits the holder to appoint or direct the distribution of funds to anyone, including the holder, his or her creditors, his or her estate, or creditors of his or her estate. The second type is a special or limited power of appointment (“LPA”) which restricts the holder’s ability to appoint or transfer. An LPA is anything that does not qualify as a GPA.

<!--more-->

The taxable estate of a holder of a GPA includes the value of assets subject to the GPA, while the taxable estate of a holder of an LPA does not. The rationale is that unrestricted use or access to property is akin to ownership and should result in estate taxation.

Joint powers of appointment (created after 10-21-42) are LPAs if the power may be exercisable only in conjunction with another person having a substantial interest in the property which is adverse to the exercise of the power by the holder. The regulations contain examples of what constitutes a general or limited power.

If, for example, Holder may only exercise the power with X’s consent, we must carefully evaluate if X is truly adverse to the Holder’s exercise of the power . Assume A creates a trust using a trust company as trustee. Income is payable to Holder; however, principal may only be distributed if X consents. At A’s death, the trust is divided equally among X, Y, and Z unless Holder, in his will, appoints in different proportions to X, Y, or Z.  Will X block a distribution to Holder if X can be cut out?  In this instance, X is not adverse to Holder.  If we eliminate Holder’s power to appoint to X, Y, or Z, then X is clearly adverse to Holder because every principal distribution reduces X’s share of the remainder.

What if we use a Distributions Committee (“DC”) in lieu of joint powers. A DC gives the power over distributions to a committee that includes non-beneficiaries in order to avoid estate taxation of any person holding power over distributions. DCs are common in Dynasty Trusts or Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor Trusts (“DINGS”). A private letter ruling (PLR) sets forth the tax treatment of issues arising out of a particular set of facts and is binding upon IRS and the taxpayer requesting it. In 2002 PLRs,trusts using DCs included succession provisions that permitted beneficiaries to be appointed to the DC; however, the beneficiary could not participate in distribution decisions affecting him or her.  The 2002 PLRs ruled that DC membership did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> cause a member to possess a GPA.

Then, in IR-2007-127, the Service indicated it was reconsidering these 2002 PLRs because the committee members could be replaced, thus conferring a GPA upon members of a DC.  Not all aspects are being reconsidered.

It appears that DCs remain an effective substitute for joint powers if beneficiaries do not replace departing members.]]></content>

Many small business owners hope that the companies they have built will outlive them and help build a family legacy. Too often, however, business owners procrastinate when it comes: (i) to estate planning, (ii) to taking advantage of gift tax exemptions and (iii) to utilizing trusts - all strategies that can help keep a company out of probate court.

<!--more-->

Businesses that fall into probate can be compromised significantly, as court proceedings can take anywhere from a few months to a year or more, according to Fox Business. Moreover, because probate court proceedings are public, every aspect of the company may be revealed, including the assets it holds and its financial standing. During this period, business operations are typically run by the executor of the owner's will, or in cases where an executor is not specified, by an individual who is court-appointed to manage the responsibility. This can not only negatively affect the company's bottom line and exclude family members from key decisions, but can also jeopardize relations with employees and customers.

One of the factors that may inhibit owners from estate planning is a lack of clarity on when they should begin. Because <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate laws</a> are subject to frequent changes, owners who begin making preparations the day they begin turning a profit will best protect themselves and their heirs, according to Fox Business.

Living trusts are one of the most common ways business owners can keep their business out of probate, since they allow the trustee to easily transfer assets in the trust to heirs and avoid disruptions in company operations. However, many business owners are getting more creative and seeking out different trust options that fit their particular business needs.

Proper estate planning can help ensure companies are passed down successfully. Data from the <a href="http://familybusinessinstit.reachlocal.com/?scid=2117529&amp;kw=12655760&amp;pub_cr_id=7810760515">Family Business Institute</a> finds that only about 30 percent of family businesses survive into a second generation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The way in which retiring business owners plan their retirement is nearly as important as the strategies they used when they first launched or took over their business. Few business owners want to see their companies dissolved, but inadequate retirement planning can lead to insolvency, infighting between heirs and higher taxes.

<a href="avoiding-the-most-common-missteps-retiring-business-owners-make"><img class="wp-image-1210 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/succession-planning-300x201.jpg" width="216" height="145" /></a>These scenarios typically occur when business owners fail to pay enough attention to succession and tax issues, and there are several situations retiring owners should consider prior to stepping down from their company.

<!--more-->

First, owners should ensure their beneficiaries are equipped to handle every facet of a company, according to the Wall Street Journal. Too often, small business owners oversee all business operations personally, ranging from marketing and advertising to accounting and tax preparation. Failing to prepare beneficiaries for decision-making roles and set clear guidelines for who will manage which divisions can lead to infighting and poor business decisions made by unqualified individuals.

Another common, and costly, mistake is failing to account for changes in a business's valuation when transferring a company. The value of a business can appreciate by millions of dollars over a short period, and procrastinating when it comes to transferring assets or taking advantage of the benefits and protections under trust law will result in a sizable increase in the amount of taxes owners will pay when they eventually hand over the reins. Business owners may benefit financially from developing a clear-cut succession plan years before they retire and researching several different trust options to reduce their tax liability, the Journal reports.

In addition, failing to frequently conduct valuations can lead to last-minute tax and retirement planning surprises for owners who may have over- or undervalued their companies. For both succession and <a title="Procrastination on Estate Planning Can Land A Small Business in Probate Court" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/procrastination-on-estate-planning-can-land-a-small-business-in-probate-court/">estate planning</a> purposes, securing an accurate appraisal and valuation is crucial.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Facebook has grabbed the headlines, but behind the scenes key personnel have undertaken critical estate planning, proving that they are more than just technically savvy.  Here’s how it worked.

<a href="facebook-and-estate-planning"><img class="wp-image-1216 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/facebook-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>The Wall Street Journal just reported that six of the insiders in <em>Facebook</em> established Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) last year.  These trusts were established at a time when the estimated fair market value of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) was expected to be about $29 to $30 a share.  Given that there are now reports that the IPO price may be significantly higher, this strategy would appear to be yielding an immediate benefit.

<!--more-->

Unlike family limited partnerships, the IRS has issued detailed regulations on GRATs; therefore it offers a more predictable outcome.  It is also easy to implement. A person transfers assets to a GRAT and receives an annuity for a term of years.  The amount of the annuity and the length of the term are selected by the taxpayer. IRS regulations give the formula.  IRS published the interest rate to be used on a monthly basis, which is 1.6% for May.

A GRAT works well if the property transferred will appreciate in value or produce a return that is higher than the interest rate that the taxpayer is required to use.  Simply stated, if the value of the assets increases in excess of 1.6%, the appreciation will escape estate and gift tax.  Thus, appreciating assets and a low interest rate are ideal conditions for this strategy.

One IRS requirement is that the assets have to be transferred to the GRAT at fair market value (“FMV”).  Publicly-traded shares provide a FMV that is obtainable without an appraisal.  No doubt the investment bankers provided the insiders with reasonable and well-supported valuations for the IPO that can also be used to support the  GRAT.

The use of GRATs by <em>Facebook</em> insiders is a clear indication of the utility of the strategy in a low-interest environment and prior to the demise of the $5,120,000 exclusion.  If ever there were a sign that now is the time to engage in <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax planning</a>, this is it.]]></content>

The document has been drafted by the IRS' compliance practice research team and is designed to help bond issuers understand issues that may arise and avoid some of the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> problems that have arisen in recent decades over investment mispricing and abuses, according to public finance publication The Bond Buyer. The compliance team was created in response to several ongoing tax disputes and bad practices seen in the market, IRS tax-exempt bond office director Cliff Gannett said at a recent <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> committee meeting.

<!--more-->

The guidance document will first be circulated internally, but then released to the American Bar Association, the National Association of Bond Lawyers, and other industry groups. The overarching goal of the document is to educate bond issuers on how to detect red flags and prevent abusive practices from occurring.

Gannett said he is eager to see if the different law organizations agree with the issues raised in the guidance document or have any additional insight to add to the matter, the news source reports.

"We really should be very serious about looking at these transactions as they have occurred and trying to identify where there are red flags that honest public officials could identify and could start to query … whether or not it is something they want to get involved in," he told the news source.

Gannett emphasized that the compliance team, which was created in February, is not attempting to write compliance rules for organizations or conduct examination work, but simply advise groups on best practices to avoid tax law disputes.

"Our goal is to incorporate the practices that are already out there," he told Bond Buyer. "I know a number of associations have best practices that they have developed. That's very important for us to understand those."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/facebook-IPO.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1229" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/facebook-IPO-300x209.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></a>Someone asked me about the impact of the IPO price on the <a title="Facebook and Estate Planning" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/2012/05/18/facebook-and-estate-planning/">Grantor Retainer Annuity Trusts</a> (GRAT’s) created by Facebook insiders.  As explained in this posting, these GRAT’s are very useful estate planning devices, and the Facebook IPO price proved somewhat useful to the insiders.

By way of background, a GRAT is a trust to which a grantor transfers property and receives an annuity for a term of years (the “Term”).  The formula and the source of the interest rate (The “§7520 Rate”) are set forth in IRS regulations.  The client selects the Term and the property to transfer to the GRAT.  The regulations require that the property transferred be valued at fair market value (FMV) at the time that it is contributed to the GRAT. No doubt, the underwriters provided ample support for the $31 FMV of Facebook stock at the time of the transfer, before the stock was publically traded.

<!--more-->

Facebook stock closed at $38 on its initial public offering day.  What the reader should know is that the difference between $38 and $31 escapes transfer taxes, which is why the use of a GRAT is so attractive.  Because the regulations require that the gift be valued and calculated at the time of transfer, it does not allow for upward or downward changes in FMV.  It is therefore hard to imagine that the pre-IPO price was going to be below what the market would eventually set as the real price.  Facebook stock is thus a perfect example of appreciating property being ideally suited for a GRAT.

To better understand a GRAT, consider the following example.  Assume that the FMV of the subject property is $100, and the interest rate is 1.6%.  The formula assumes the property will grow to $101.60 at the end of year one and to $102.41 at the end of year two.  If the property appreciates in value at a rate greater than 1.6%, the appreciation in excess of 1.6% is not part of the gift. The $7 increase in value of the Facebook stock exceeds 1.6%, so the strategy worked.

The $5,120,000 Federal Estate Tax exclusion (the “Exclusion”) is set to expire at year-end.  The §7520 Rate dropped to 1.2%.  Clients should take advantage of incredibly low interest rates and a lackluster economy that depresses FMV of assets.  The insiders of Facebook have shown us the utility of GRATs for assets that are expected to appreciate.

I want to send a message to skeptics and procrastinators.   If the Exclusion drops to $1,000,000 as scheduled, where will your estate find the cash to pay the estate tax if you do not act this year?]]></content>

Why is this noteworthy?  The Wall Street Journal reported on the expected synergies and savings in several areas.  The Journal also cited tax reasons.  Eaton will avoid imposing the complex US tax rules on Cooper’s business.  Eaton will also not have to worry about repatriating Cooper’s earnings back to the US.  Instead, Eaton will have more flexibility as it seeks to expand around the world.

<!--more-->

It may also be noteworthy that Eaton chose a taxable form of transaction whereby the shareholders of Eaton will be taxed at the time of the exchange, but not the corporation.  2012 is the last year for lower individual tax rates, unless Congress acts,  so it is easy to understand the timing.

There were alternative forms to the one chosen by Eaton.  The §367(a) anti-expatriation rules are designed to prevent corporate flight.  Even if the rules of §367(a) are satisfied, §7874 may apply.   §7874 was enacted to stop corporate inversions and thwart expatriation.   Corporate “inversions” are a type of expatriation where a foreign corporation becomes the direct or indirect owner of the domestic parent's stock or assets. In an inversion, the foreign corporation is a subsidiary of the former domestic parent. The corporate structure is “inverted,” with the former foreign subsidiary becomes the new parent.  Consider the corporations that have inverted: Seagate Technologies, Stanley Works, Weatherford International Inc., Cooper Industries [yes, the same one], Fruit of the Loom, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (Accenture), Ingersoll-Rand, Nabors Industries, Foster Wheeler, and Tyco International.

Over time, more of Eaton’s treasury operations, intellectual property royalties and sales in foreign countries will be placed beyond the taxing jurisdiction of the US. The plan calls for an Irish company (“New Eaton”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of: (a) Cooper from Cooper shareholders for cash and newly issued ordinary shares of New Eaton, and (b) Eaton, with shareholders to receive one share of New Eaton stock for each share owned.  Eaton will merge with an Ohio corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Eaton, with Eaton surviving the merger. As a result, Eaton and Cooper will become wholly owned subsidiaries of New Eaton but New Eaton will not be subject to US taxation, except for business conducted in the US.

This is the tax law of unintended indirect consequences at work. Laws imposing higher taxes are designed to close budget deficits; however, these laws eventually cause larger deficits by encouraging behavior (expatriation) that the anti-inversion rules were designed to prevent.  Steely Dan, I believe, already has the copyright on Pretzel Logic, but certainly not the monopoly.]]></content>

<a href="creating-a-succession-partnership-can-mitigate-disputes"><img class="wp-image-1241 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/05/succession-planning1-300x201.jpg" width="216" height="145" /></a>Some parents find it challenging to treat their children equally when one may be better suited at business than others, according to personal finance website The Street. When faced with the prospect of multiple successors, many owners turn to business partnerships to give each of their children a stake and role in the business.

While these partnerships can help quell feelings of favoritism among successors, a poorly outlined succession partnership can result in infighting among siblings that may threaten the company. Business owners who plan ahead may have more time to prepare children for the demands of running a business. For example, parents who take a step back from operations and allow future successors to play a larger role may give them insight into the types of problems that may arise, according to the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/fambiz/">University of Massachusetts Amherst Family Business Center</a>.

During this transition period, business owners can retain the authority to step in and mitigate potential problems. This phase may also educate successors on their own strengths and weaknesses, giving them time to correct any shortcomings that may affect the business's bottom line.

In addition, developing a partnership charter that clearly outlines each child's role in the company, responsibilities and stake in the business can help prevent sibling infighting and make the estate administration process easier. Charters should include the strategic plan for the business, the roles, titles and authority of each partner and how much money should go in and out of the business. These stipulations can be crucial when siblings have different ideas of where they would like to take a business in the future.]]></content>

This is all a apart of the IRS Reclassification Program.

After the Internal Revenue Service rolled out its <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=246013,00.html">Voluntary Classification Settlement Program</a> (VCSP), businesses had the opportunity to come forward and avoid hefty penalties if they had misclassified workers as independent contractors. The program allows employers to change a worker's status from independent contractor to employee for future tax periods without incurring penalties or interest for the past misclassification.

<!--more-->

While some businesses may label employees as contractors to avoid paying workers' compensation, benefits and taxes under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> guidelines, many businesses may misclassify employees due to the blurring definitions of workers versus contractors, The News-Press reports.

However, businesses are now receiving more attention from state agencies and the IRS regarding their employee labeling now that the program is in place. For example, several small companies in Southwest Florida have been shut down during audits and received large fines for failing to classify employees correctly and provide worker's compensation, the news source reports. In many of these instances, it is state, rather than federal, tax agencies conducting these audits.

Shelly Osterhout, for example, was forced to close down her computer business for ten days to allow the <a href="http://www.myfloridacfo.com/wc/">Florida Division of Workers' Compensation</a> to conduct an audit after it received an anonymous that she was mislabeling employees. Although her business was cleared and she was allowed to re-open, she lost between $10,000 to $15,000 in revenue and took a hit to her reputation, she told the news source.

For these reasons, businesses around the country may benefit from making sure their employee classifications fall in line with federal and state tax law to avoid the financial ramifications of an audit.]]></content>

However, the results of a new study reveal that global efforts have been largely ineffective.

Data from the <a href="http://www.bis.org/">Bank of International Settlements</a> shows that bank accounts in offshore tax havens held roughly $2.7 trillion in 2011, approximately the same amount they held in 2007 prior to new efforts to force compliance under <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. Researchers say that international treaties, which have been signed by the United States and several European countries, have been futile because the business owners and wealthy individuals who utilize tax havens move their funds to locations that aren't covered by the treaties.

<!--more-->

In addition, researchers say some weakly worded tax law treaties also make it easier for businesses and individuals to evade prosecution. Lastly, those who had access to the bank data report that corporate structures spanning multiple havens have also presented obstacles to tax authorities.

For these reasons, the study's authors say that efforts are likely to remain fruitless.

"So far, the G20 tax haven crackdown has … largely failed … Treaties have led to a modest relocation of bank deposits between tax havens but have not triggered significant flows of funds out of tax havens," concluded Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman, who had access to the report data.

Despite the results, the IRS has continued to step up its auditing efforts of small and large businesses in attempts to close the tax gap and curb tax evasion.

A November report released by the Center for Tax Justice reveals that of the $3 trillion in tax losses that affect the global economy each year, the U.S. takes the largest financial hit.]]></content>

<!--more-->

Mr. Saverin was a US citizen for ten years, having come here from his native Brazil. Mr. Saverin denies that he renounced his U.S citizenship for tax reasons although it is true that he has no long-standing ties to the US and no longer works at Facebook.   Notwithstanding the denial, financial considerations had to have played some part in his decision.

It is not that difficult to understand why Singapore was an attractive alternative, aside from the economic growth in the region.  The tax climate in Singapore is benign as there is no estate or inheritance tax.  When faced with the unknown tax climate in the U.S., one might argue that his departure was a reasonable step in order to obtain certainty.  Singapore has a territorial system of taxation which is unlike the worldwide system of the US.  One would fully expect that Mr. Saverin’s Facebook stock, proceeds of any sale and other assets were deposited in a tax-friendly jurisdiction outside of Singapore.  Unless the income is remitted to Singapore, it is not taxed nor even reported to the government. Those of you familiar with foreigners moving to London may know that “drop-off” trusts in the Channel Islands were a common practice. An over-simplified example follows, calling for two trusts would be created.  One trust would hold assets and pay into a second trust the amount of income to be remitted to London and thus taxed.

Recently, Eaton Corporation transplanted itself into Ireland with its 12.5% corporate tax rate in order to compete more efficiently and isolate its international earnings outside the United States.  Thus, the relentless assault on the high cost of doing business continues regardless of whether that the cost is in the form of taxation or labor.]]></content>

The dispute began in 2009 after HP sued the IRS for more than $190 million in tax refunds the company claimed it was owed from 1996, after implementing a cost-cutting tax strategy established by the derivatives trading sector of the American International Group, according to Reuters. The strategy - named the foreign tax credit generator - revolves around trading derivative products to generate capital losses and foreign tax credits for corporations, which then utilize them to lower tax bills, the news source explains.

<!--more-->

U.S. companies use the strategy to invest in foreign low-tax jurisdictions, and then claim tax-lowering credits for payments owed to the foreign entities on those investments, Reuters adds.

While the IRS allows for some foreign tax credit generators, they outlawed most of these practices in 2007, claiming that many of the strategies are purposefully designed to create superficial beneficials that are not valid under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>.

Judge Joseph Goeke of the U.S Tax Court in Washington, D.C., agreed with the IRS in his 82-page opinion. He noted that HP's investments in the Dutch entity, Foppingadreef, were not real economic bets, and were instead considered carefully structured loans to the entity, which were repaid.

"HP's investment is more appropriately characterized as debt, rather than equity, for Federal income tax purposes," Judge Goeke wrote.

Both HP and the IRS have not commented on the ruling, but HP is also still battling the IRS in a separate case to recover additional funds from three other years.]]></content>

During the process of creating a succession plan, valuing a company and establishing trusts that fall in line with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, it's possible to overlook small details, such as digital assets. However, the assets a company holds online are just as crucial as physical holdings, and including them in a business estate plan can help mitigate potential issues or delays.

<!--more-->

A recent global study conducted by McAfee shows Americans value their digital assets at an average value of roughly $55,000.

Digital assets include online bank and merchant accounts, frequent flier programs, social media accounts, domain names, intellectual property and server passwords. Accessing these accounts without including instructions or a specific executor in an estate plan can be difficult, and may affect a company's bottom line, according to Inc.com. As social media and technology become more integrated in marketing efforts and relied upon to maintain relationships with clients and vendors, failing to address these issues can be particularly harmful during the transition period between an owner's death and the successor's takeover.

There may be privacy issues at stake as well, involving business interests, correspondence between clients and company financial data that, in the wrong hands, could weaken a company's profile or reputation. For these reasons, more companies are consulting with their estate planning attorneys to include their digital assets in their succession and estate plans.

Businesses can also mitigate potential issues by naming a digital executor and leaving them login information, passwords and instructions as to how these accounts are to be settled and maintained, the news source suggests.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<em>Facebook</em>’s initial public offering (IPO) and the subsequent decline in the price of its stock are daily fare for the media.  I have been asked whether the <a title="Facebook and Estate Planning" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/2012/05/18/facebook-and-estate-planning/">Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) </a>wealth transfer strategy used by some <em>Facebook</em> insiders will be successful in light of these recent events.

<em><a href="remedial-steps-to-protect-a-grat-holding-facebook-stock"><img class="wp-image-1272 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/06/facebook-ipo2-300x199.jpg" width="270" height="179" /></a></em>GRATs are successful when the underlying assets, such as <em>Facebook</em> stock, appreciate in value at a rate which is greater than §7520 rate (1.2% in June).  Given all of the bad news in the financial press today, appreciation in the price of any stock does not seem realistic. Does this mean the GRAT has failed? The answer is: no.  The reason is that it is relatively easy to devise one or more financial strategies to protect against a decline in the price of the stock.  These financial strategies can be used in estate and gift planning.

Investors have utilized puts and calls as a means of protecting against loss and locking in gains.  It is not difficult to imagine that the insiders were advised to consider such strategies in conjunction with their GRATs.  Let us assume the <em>Facebook</em> shares were valued at $31 at the time of contribution to the GRAT.  The GRAT would succeed handsomely if the shares increased to $50 in one or two years. Such an increase would mean the increase in price to $50 over $31 would pass to the remainderman of the trust. As we have seen, stocks do not always go up.  Suppose the insider wanted to protect against downside risk and he caused the GRAT to purchase a put of <em>Facebook </em>stock at an exercise price of $31.  If the market price declined to $26, the GRAT would force the counterparty to purchase the shares, thus reducing the potential loss.

Combining financial strategies with multiple GRATs permits the transferor to hedge market risk.  A carefully planned strategy that is hedged will permit a client’s wealth to be transferred successfully under most any market conditions.]]></content>

The taxpayer and advisors in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimmer</span>, however, learned from the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl</span> case and were successful as a result. Nevertheless, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl </span>continues to be a shining example of what happens when taxpayers ignore some of the basic doctrines of tax law in implementing a popular strategy.

<!--more-->

I have simplified the facts for this analysis.  In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimmer</span>, as in Hackl, the taxpayers created a limited partnership (an “LP”) and sought to qualify gifts of the limited partnership interests to a trust as a gift of a present interest.  What many readers assume to be true however is decidedly not. The gift of an interest in property does not automatically qualify as a gift of a present interest. A present interest is a term of art and means an unrestricted right to the immediate use, possession, or enjoyment of property.  In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl</span> the transfer of interests did not convey the immediate use or enjoyment of property because there were no distributions of cash or immediate benefit from the receipt of property.  In fact, the underlying <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl</span> business was timber, and growing trees requires years of cultivation (translated: losses) before trees can be cut (translated: realize a profit). The recipients therefore received no present benefit from the gifts other than an expectation of a profit many years in the future.

By contrast, in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimmer</span>, the LP received dividends and made distributions to all partners, in proportion to their respective ownership interests. Here the estate met its burden that the gifts were of a present interest by satisfying a three-part test.  First, the estate proved the LP would generate income from its portfolio of blue chip stocks.  This is a significant difference from <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl</span>. Second, the estate proved that income would flow to the partners.  Consider that the forestry and business plan in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hackl</span> showed losses for several years and those losses were allocated to the founders to offset other income. This diminished, in the eyes of the Court, the present value of the interests gifted and relegated the gifts to those of a future interest or expectancy.  Third, the income to be distributed was ascertainable.  In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimmer</span>, the cash distributions were consistent with ownership percentages and not arbitrary or speculative.   Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimmer</span> offers renewed hope for investment partnerships as part of a viable gifting strategy.

Why are gifts of a present interest significant? The reason is that a gift of a present interest may be offset by the annual exclusion, which was $10,000 in those years.  Gifts of future interests may not be offset, and they thus eat away at your lifetime exemption.  In the years 1996 through 2000, the federal estate tax exemption was only $600,000, and preserving the exemption was more important than in 2012 where the exemption is now $5,120,000.

As we approach the tax and fiscal cliff in 2013, qualifying as a present interest may once again become important if the exemption falls to $1,000,000 as scheduled.

		<content><![CDATA[The world news is dominated by the Greek elections, the bailout of Spain, and the potential demise of the European Union.  In the U.S., the presidential election, the fiscal cliff, and taxmageddon are the major stories.  Hidden in plain sight is a fantastic estate planning opportunity to transfer assets to future generations at minimal cost relative to paying death taxes.

<a href="low-interest-rates-offer-incredible-estate-planning-opportunities"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1282 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/06/greece-euro-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>The Internal Revenue Code requires related parties to charge a minimum rate of interest on inter-family transactions.  The rate of interest that is required to be charged on an inter-family loan depends upon the term of the note.  <em>Alliance Bernstein</em> projects July interest rates to be: (i) 0.24% for the short term rate (not over 3 years); (ii) 0.93% for the mid-term rate (over 3 years but not over 9 years); (iii)  2.30% for the long-term rate (over 9 years).  Imagine purchasing a successful family business or an income producing property while paying interest at a 2.30% rate for ten or twenty years.   The asset’s cash flow should be sufficient to pay interest and principal on the note. The appreciation in value of the asset after the sale will not be included in the estate of the seller.   The substitution of a note, with little appreciation potential, for an asset with substantial appreciation potential, in effect, caps the value of the seller’s estate.

Those readers of this blog may recall the analysis of <a title="Remedial Steps To Protect A GRAT Holding Facebook Stock" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/remedial-steps-to-protect-a-grat-holding-facebook-stock/">Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (“GRAT”) by Facebook insiders</a>.  The Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) for use by a GRAT is expected to be 1.2% for July.  This means that an asset, appraised at $100 on the date of gift to a GRAT, is expected to grow in value to $101.20 and to $102.41 at the end of years one and two, respectively. Thus, any appreciation in value in excess of $102.41 escapes transfer tax.    Consider that 1.2% is less than the expected return on blue chip stocks, investment grade bonds and municipal securities.

What is surprising to me and my tax colleagues is how little attention transfer planning is actually receiving.  Clients should analyze their assets for appreciation potential and then calculate the expected tax savings that would result.  Clients should also analyze their own need for income (cash) so as to select the appropriate monthly payment of interest and principal.

The federal estate tax exemption falls from $5,120,000 in 2012 to $1,000,000 in 2013.  Transfers should be made this year because the larger exemption offers more protection against audit adjustments.  The larger exemption also affords the transferor opportunity to use the technique of part-gift part-sale. This technique is especially useful where the asset being transferred is only beginning to generate cash flow or where the transferor has no need for large repayments on the note.]]></content>

However, the most critical concern most business owners address that causes the most headaches is the complicated tax code.

A study conducted by <a href="http://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/en/about/">Alvarex &amp; Marsal Taxand</a> reveals that most chief financial officers believe uncertainty regarding U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> has become more pressing than a reduction in corporate tax rates. When asked which element of the tax code they would change, 37 percent of CFOs said they would eliminate uncertainty.

"For companies to plan, to invest, to create jobs and to grow, they must have certainty," said Robert Lowe, CEO of A&amp;M Taxand. "In fact, confidence in knowing precisely what the tax code will require has become more important than how much it will cost them. As our research reveals, as long as proposed changes remain up in the air, companies will be forced to continue to burn fuel operating in holding patterns rather than charting productive courses forward."

According to the study, 90 percent of business executives with corporate holdings of $1 billion or more take tax considerations into account when making business decisions. Seventy-seven percent of financial professionals at smaller companies gave the same response.

A separate study, "<a href="http://www.laffercenter.com/the-economic-burden-caused-by-tax-code-complexity/">The Economic Burden Caused by Tax Code Complexity</a>," conducted by the Laffner Center, businesses spent $2.94 billion complying with the business income tax code in 2011, which includes the costs of retaining accountants, attorneys and tax professionals to ensure they follow tax law guidelines. The study's authors also noted that this figure does not include the cost of audits, which may represent the highest costs of all.]]></content>

Current federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> exempts estates under $5 million, while those with assets above that threshold are taxed up to 35 percent. However, unless Congress acts before the end of this calendar year, that tax-free level will drop to $1 million with the top tax rate jumping to 55 percent. An additional surtax of 5 percent will also be assessed on very large estates.

<!--more-->

Some small business owners testifying at the hearing said that their companies may be adversely affected by the lower exemption. Karen Madonia, chief financial officer of an Illinois air conditioning and refrigeration company, said her business needs to have a valuable inventory, even if its liquid assets are less extensive.

"In most cases, we're not talking about passing on bank accounts with multimillion-dollar balances. We're talking about businesses where most of the net worth is tied up in inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and real estate," she said.

Estimates from the Tax Policy Center show that the $1 million exemption would result in approximately 53,000 estates being subject to federal taxes, compared to less than 4,000 this year.

Others testifying at the hearing added that while the estate tax itself represents a fiscal burden on some companies, repeated changes to the regulations have exacerbated the issue. Data from the American Bar Association shows that the exemption level has changed five times since 2001.

The estate tax is one of many tax and budget issues which have been highlighted as the "fiscal cliff" by Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. Roughly $7 trillion in tax increases and spending cuts will start on January 1 without further action.]]></content>

The probe will explore the financial records of the Dodgers while they were under ownership of the McCourts, and sources close to the investigation say there is evidence of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations, loan fraud, bankruptcy fraud and other improprieties. Sources, who have remained anonymous to protect the confidentiality of the probe during the grand jury investigation, told the Los Angeles Times that records have already been collected from the team and the McCourts.

<!--more-->

Documents surrounding Frank and Jamie McCourt's divorce proceedings and the MLB baseball team's subsequent bankruptcy are also expected to shed insight into the allegations of financial misconduct. The divorce documents reveal prolific spending on luxury homes, memberships and a six-figure hair stylist retained for the couple, according to The Associated Press. In addition, four of the couple's sons were listed on the Dodgers' payroll, despite one's employment at Goldman Sachs and another son's enrollment at Stanford University. During the divorce, Frank McCourt told the courts the couple failed to pay federal or state taxes between 2004 and 2009.

Prosecuting authorities say the spending of team funds has raised questions and accuse Frank McCourt of using roughly $189 million of the Dodgers' funds for personal purposes.

However, attorneys representing Frank McCourt say their client is not the subject of a criminal investigation, but a series of standard audits that the Internal Revenue Service has been conducting for years, the AP reports.

McCourt sold the team for $2.15 billion in May, but retained ownership of half the stadium parking lots along with the new owners.]]></content>

Joseph Mohamed, who is a successful real estate developer, appraiser and entrepreneur in California, donated several pieces of real estate to a charitable remainder trust in 2003 and 2004, claiming $18.5 million in charitable deductions. These trusts allow owners to claim immediate deductions on the contributions, despite collecting income on the assets. After the owners' death, the remainder of the trust is given to charity.

<!--more-->

However, Mohamed completed his own taxes and failed to submit a qualified appraisal that provided an up-to-date value of the assets. This triggered an audit, which prompted the Mohameds to have the assets appraised. The results of the valuation revealed the properties were actually worth $20.3 million, but the IRS rejected the deductions due to the Mohamed's failure to submit the proper forms.

U.S. Tax Judge Mark Holmes ruled in favor of the IRS.

"We recognize that this result is harsh - a complete denial of charitable deductions to a couple that did not overvalue, and may well have undervalued, their contributions," Holmes wrote in his court opinion.

However, Holmes explained that, in accordance with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, the Mohameds did not comply with substantiation requirements and the deduction was invalid.

Noting that the law is clear, Holmes wrote that "a taxpayer relies on his private interpretation of a tax form at his own risk."

The case highlights the need of business owners who are making substantial tax decisions to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_blank">consult an attorney</a> during filing season to ensure they don't overlook small errors that could result in substantial losses following an audit.]]></content>

The U.S. Attorney's office of New Jersey said the singer failed to file income taxes with the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007 and pay taxes on roughly $1.6 million in income. The singer currently owns and operates Creations Music Inc., Boogie Tours Inc., L.H. Productions 2001 Inc. and Studio 22 Inc., and earns the majority of her income from royalties through these companies.

<!--more-->

The Newark, New Jersey, resident is scheduled to appear before a U.S. Tax Court on June 29. If convicted of violating federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, she may face up to one year in prison and $100,000 in fines on each of the three charges.

Hill recently responded to the allegations and explained on Tumblr that she failed to meet her tax obligations because she was "underground" trying to "build a community."

"For the past several years, I have remained what others would consider underground," she wrote. "I did this in order to build a community of people, like-minded in their desire for freedom and the right to pursue their goals and lives without being manipulated and controlled by a media-protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda."

In addition, Hill noted that she previously alerted authorities about her reasons for failing to pay her taxes, but they did not comply with her wishes.

"I conveyed all of this when questioned as to why I did not file taxes during this time period," she wrote. "Obviously, the danger I faced was not accepted as reasonable grounds for deferring my tax payments, as authorities, who despite being told all of this, still chose to pursue action against me, as opposed to finding an alternative solution."]]></content>

Changes to gift and estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> that are set to go into motion at the end of the year have many business owners and high net-worth Americans scrambling to develop succession and inheritance plans that will help keep estate taxes to a minimum.

Due to the financial and tax ramifications of these estate planning tasks, business entities should consider contacting a professional to assist them, rather than performing these responsibilities alone.

<!--more-->

In many cases, business owners may not realize how complex their estates may truly be, especially if they have not yet developed a succession plan or assessed their company's value in a long period of time. For these reasons, making estate planning decisions without the guidance of a tax professional and attorney can result in individuals making less-informed decisions that can have heavy consequences, said former president of the Virginia Mortgage Bankers Association, Steven Rockefeller.

In addition to making potentially costly estate planning mistakes, individuals who are uninformed about tax law may inadvertently transfer high expenses to their successors. Confusing or ill-prepared estate documents may require survivors to seek legal representation to sort out mistakes.

Consulting a professional can also help business owners ensure that certain stipulations regarding a company's operations are clearly outlined. For example, business owners may make certain rules regarding the allocation of financial resources or the roles and responsibilities of successors who take over a company. In some cases, owners may also choose to utilize the tax protection that trusts afford them to ensure that their business legacy remains intact.]]></content>

There are several personal elements business owners must factor in to ensure success and prevent costly problems from endangering their company and legacy.

First and most immediate are the tax implications of handing control over to another individual. There are several viable options under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> that enable owners to protect their assets during the transition to a new owner. Conducting timely valuations of a company's worth and utilizing the advantages of trusts and ownership options can shield new leadership from excessive tax burdens.

<!--more-->

Business owners should consider working with a professional to manage their tax burden prior to the year's end. Current estate and gift tax rules are expected to expire at the end of 2012, and may not be as favorable in the coming years.

Focusing on a company's tax burden and bottom line is crucial during succession planning, but it should not overshadow other elements, such as outlining roles and expectations of new management. The most financially solvent company can quickly be brought down by inexperienced leaders, family squabbles for authority and misunderstandings in a succession plan. This is especially true when more than one individual will be in a position of leadership.

Management issues can be avoided by clarifying the roles, responsibilities and managing authority of each successor and including these details in estate documents. This can help ensure a company's balance of power stays intact and prevent any one owner from deviating from the goals of the business. In many cases, business owners may choose to transfer partial ownership to successors early to ensure they are capable of taking on new roles.]]></content>

Weinland was found guilty of five <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations when he failed to pay more than $350,000 in taxes between 2005 and 2010. Jurors agreed with the grand jury indictment, which accused the preacher of funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into a Swiss bank account, lying on federal tax forms and writing off personal expenses as church expenses. These deductions included stays at the Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas, tickets to the Blue Man Group and clothing purchases at Nordstrom.

<!--more-->

Weinland defended his actions, arguing that the financial system would collapse before the world ended. He also explained using church funds to pay for family members' housing arrangements and his home security system by noting he receives death threats due to his teachings. However, prosecutors argued that Weiland's personal religious beliefs and teachings could not be used as a viable excuse for his failure to report on foreign bank accounts or for his taking false tax deductions.

The preacher also noted that he never attempted to educate himself on the validity of his tax deductions.

The jury took less than four hours to convict Weinland on all counts. He put up a $300,000 bond and was placed under house arrest with electronic monitoring until U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves sentences him on September 24. He will face up to five years in prison.

Weinland gained notoriety by twice predicting the end of the world, first to occur on September 30, 2008 then again on May 27, 2012.]]></content>

The federal tax agency announced this week that it has been successful in collecting more than $5 billion since 2009 from offshore tax evaders due in large part to its Voluntary Disclosure Program. The initial program was launched in 2009 and two additional programs were announced in 2011 and 2012. Through the initiative, those who violate federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> by failing to report income in offshore accounts can escape jail time and receive reduced penalties if they voluntarily provide information about their accounts and pay taxes.

<!--more-->

To date, the IRS said that 33,000 tax evaders have come forward since the first two programs were launched and paid back taxes, interest and penalties owed to the federal government. Furthermore, the agency said an additional 1,500 taxpayers have come forward since the most recent program was launched in January 2012.

"We continue to make strong progress in our international compliance efforts that help ensure honest taxpayers are not footing the bill for those hiding assets offshore," said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. "People are finding it tougher and tougher to keep their assets hidden in offshore accounts."

The most recent program requires those who disclose unreported offshore funds to pay a penalty of 27.5 percent of their account's highest balance in the previous eight tax years. Those who do not participate in the disclosure program and are charged with evading taxes face jail time and a requirement to pay penalties of up to 50 percent or more of their total balance.]]></content>

However, it may be uncertainty over future taxes that prompts many small businesses to close their doors in 2012, according to a new analysis.

Reuters recently spoke with several business owners who are struggling to sell their companies before the year's end. The most prominent reason many owners cited for selling revolved around potential tax increases and changes to estate and gift <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> that are expected to occur in 2013. Michael Butler, CEO of privately-owned investment bank Cascadia Capital, said his company is experiencing significantly higher call volumes from small business owners who are interested in selling before the year's end.

<!--more-->

"A lot of people are nervous about the tax situation," Butler told Reuters. "We're also seeing a lot of businesses that really went through a tough time in the recession and have now kind of bounced back as survivors. People are saying, 'Hey, the risk-reward is skewed such that I think I had better just try to sell now than go through another cycle.'"

There are several potential tax issues that are driving many small business decisions. Low capital gains rates, which currently sit at 15 percent, are set to expire and may climb to 20 percent in the future. The favorable tax rules that govern estate and gift taxes are also likely to change if the government does not intervene, making many owners contemplate their business planning and succession strategies.

Lastly, uncertainty over how Medicare and healthcare taxes will impact them in the future is another concern business owners share.]]></content>

Hill, who owns four record labels, plead guilty to violating federal tax law by failing to pay income taxes on more than $1.8 million between 2005 and 2007. According to court documents, the 37-year-old neglected to pay $818,000 in 2005, $222,000 in 2006 and $761,000 in 2007. Although Hill plead guilty, she wrote a lengthy email explanation to fans regarding her reasons for violating tax law.

She noted that she went underground for several years to keep herself and her six children safe.

"I did not deliberately abandon my fans, nor did I deliberately abandon any responsibilities, but I did however put my safety, health and freedom and the freedom, safety and health of my family first over all other material concerns," Hill wrote on her personal website. She also noted that she plans to pay back the full amount of taxes she owes to the federal government.

Hill's attorney also asserted that many people evade taxes each year, but the singer/record-label owner was deliberately targeted due to her celebrity status.

Upon accepting her guilty plea, U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Shipp ordered Hill to undergo mental health counseling, although he did not further clarify the reason behind the ruling. Hill will face a maximum of one year in jail for each count of tax evasion and up to $75,000 in fines. Bail was set at $150,000 and sentencing will be held in November.]]></content>

Executor responsibilities include submitting payments to creditors, divvying up the estate to beneficiaries, and managing the decedent's private affairs. Executors typically act as the middleman in ensuring all of an individual's financial obligations were satisfied, but in certain scenarios, they may face personal liabilities.

A well-organized estate plan is one that takes several factors into account, including federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. In cases where the decedent failed to adhere to tax law and, as a result, owes a balance to the federal government, it's crucial that executors prioritize these payments to avoid personal liability, according to the Cannon Financial Institute.<!--more-->

The institute highlighted a recent memorandum that explained a scenario in which personal liability may fall on an executor. In one instance, an individual passed away and left an estate whose assets were placed in a foreign trust. The executor paid creditors and beneficiaries from the trust. However, the IRS later determined that the decedent failed to file certain returns associated with the trust, and charged penalties against the estate.

In this case, if there was enough remaining in the trust to pay the IRS balance, the executor could use those estate funds to cover the amount. However, if the remaining balance was insufficient to cover these costs and the executor had prior notice from the IRS about the penalties and still chose to pay creditors and beneficiaries first, he or she would be held personally liable for the costs.

For this reason, it is crucial that executors ensure all estate and tax documentation was filed correctly prior to distributing assets to avoid liability.]]></content>

The new law was recently approved and signed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, and is designed to provide a measure of financial relief from state <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. The exemption was included in the recently passed Pennsylvania Tax Code bill and extends to various farm industries, including both crops and livestock. The exemption will go into effect immediately, and Corbett hopes the law will help farmers pass on working land to heirs without worrying they will have to pay heavy "death taxes." Lawmakers in other other states have also pushed similar proposals recently.

<!--more-->

"The death tax has forced too many families to sell their legacy, their land and their way of life," said Governor Corbett. "This tax has put too many farms out of business because it was too expensive for farmers to pass them down to their children. This will happen no more. We intend to save our farms."

Prior to the legislation, heirs who inherited working farms were required to pay a 4.5 percent tax if they were adult children of the deceased and 12 percent if they were siblings.

Real estate and property taxes have placed a significant financial burden on many farmers, and many working properties in the state have been broken up or forced to close down altogether as a result of estate and inheritance tax burdens, according to the Bucks County Courier Times.

Although Pennsylvania farmers may be exempt from state taxes, they will still need to plan for federal estate and gift taxes, as current tax rules are set to expire at the end of 2012.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">By:  Joel N. Kreizman, Partner, Co-Chair Litigation Group</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perhaps So – If the New Jersey Supreme Court Agrees</strong></p>
<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/07/gavel-glasses.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1390" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/07/gavel-glasses-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>In a recent decision by New Jersey’s Appellate Division, two members of a three judge Panel answered the above question, in the circumstances presented, in the affirmative.  The third panel member, Judge Stephen Skillman, dissented, arguing that an unexecuted will may never be admitted to probate.  However, under New Jersey Court Rules, decisions of split Appellate Division panels are subject to automatic appeal to the State Supreme Court.  Accordingly, the ultimate answer to the question should be provided during the High Court’s next term.

<!--more-->

The case is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the Matter Of The Estate Of Richard Ehrlich</span></strong>.  The decedent was a lawyer who had sent the original of his will to his executor.  The executor, however, predeceased Ehrlich and the executed will was never found.  The matter came before the court, not on a lost will claim, but on a contention that the unsigned copy should be accepted for probate because there was clear and convincing evidence that the copy expressed the decedent’s intentions.  The beneficiary who proffered the will argued, and the majority of the appellate panel held, that the statute setting forth the formalities of a will, <strong>N.J.S.</strong> 3B:3-2, <em>et seq.</em>, should be liberally construed to carry out the testator’s intent.  They cited, in particular, to <strong>N.J.S.</strong> 3B:3-3 which states:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Although a document or writing added upon a document was not executed in compliance with <strong>N.J.S.</strong> 3B:3-2, the document or writing is treated as if it had been executed in compliance with <strong>N.J.S.</strong> 3B:3-2 if the proponent of the document or writing establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document or writing to constitute: (1) the decedent’s will …</p>
The dispute between the majority and Judge Skillman was not based on the strength of the evidence supporting the testator’s intent.  Rather, the dissent argued that <strong>N.J.S.</strong> 3B:3-3 “only allows the admission to probate of a defectively executed will, not an unexecuted will.”

In support of that position, Judge Skillman reviewed the statute’s legislative history, which includes references to interpretations of similar statutes in other jurisdictions, as well as to the <strong>Restatement (Third) of Property</strong>.  The comments to the latter, state, in part:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Only a harmless error in executing a document can be excused under this Restatement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Among the defects in execution that can be excused, the lack of a signature is the hardest to excuse.  An unsigned will raises a serious but not insuperable doubt about whether the testator adopted the documents as his or her will.</p>
Judge Skillman further pointed out that the decedent was an attorney who specialized in estates and trusts, someone who would certainly know that an unexecuted will is unlikely to be probated.  So may an unexecuted will be admitted to probate?  With valid arguments on both sides of the issue, prediction is nearly impossible.  Time – and the New Jersey Supreme Court -- will tell.]]></content>

The Tax Court of New Jersey (the “Court”) held, that the Estate of Warshaw (the “Estate”) was entitled to a refund of New Jersey Estate Tax (“NJET”) paid where the Estate subsequently learned the decedent was a victim of the Ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff.  The decedent died on May 27, 2006 and the executors made estimated tax payments before filing a New Jersey Estate Tax return on July 30 2007.  The decedent’s IRA was managed by Madoff’s investment advisory firm and its assets were held by its related custodian.  <!--more-->

The Estate paid New Jersey Estate Tax based upon a one-line statement provided by the Custodian that valued the IRA at $1,463,733 at date of death.  In December 2008, Mr. Madoff was arrested, pled guilty on March 12, 2009 and was sentenced on June 29, 2009. The Estate submitted a refund claim on January 12, 2009. The NJET is based upon federal estate tax law which holds that the value at death is determined without regard to subsequent events.  Federal estate tax law does permit the consideration of subsequent events to establish the value at time of death.  The Court held that the subsequent events revealed that the IRA was worthless at the time of death.  Federal law relies on a willing buyer-seller test to establish value and a willing buyer would have demanded a list of assets in the IRA before consummating the purchase.  Taxpayers sometimes believe incorrectly that this line of cases can be used to support a lesser price resulting from a downward trend in market conditions.

<strong>Sales And Use Tax – Letter Ruling Regarding the Purchase of Commercial Gases</strong>

The ruling states that various gases, including oxygen, acetylene, argon, and other mixes are exempt from New Jersey sales tax.  Taxpayers should avail themselves of opportunity to request a ruling from the State as it provides certainty for taxpayers on issues critical to the long-term health and success of their business.

<strong>State Business Tax Climate </strong>

The Tax Foundation Background Paper No. 62, 2012 State Business Tax Climate Index ranked New Jersey as the least favorable state for small business.

Governor Christie vetoed a measure that would increase the income tax rate to 10.75% from 8.97% on incomes $1,000,000.]]></content>

New Jersey resident Theodore Warshaw passed away in 2006, and left behind an estate that was valued at roughly $1.8 million. New Jersey estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> requires that residents whose estates exceed $675,000 pay taxes, and Warshaw's executors paid approximately $88,677 in taxes. Court documents reveal that the majority of Warshaw's assets were held in an individual retirement account managed by Bernard Madoff Securities, which claimed the contributions were being invested in stocks, bonds and other investment vehicles.

<!--more-->

The IRA fund, which was transferred to a trust for Warshaw's widow, was valued at $1.4 million. Following Madoff's arrest in 2008, it was discovered that the $1.4 million in IRA assets were actually valued at $0.

Warshaw's executors appealed to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, and argued that the estate fell below the $675,000 threshold because the IRA actually had no value at the time of Warshaw's death. The state tax division denied the refund request, citing a 1929 Supreme Court case that ruled the value of assets in a taxable estate cannot be calculated by events that take place following the estate holder's death. The appeal was taken to the Tax Court of New Jersey.

The court ruled that Warshaw's estate should be refunded the $88,677, explaining that the Madoff Ponzi scheme was relevant to the valuation of the funds at the time of Warshaw's death. The court said in its opinion that "subsequent events may be considered to establish evidence of fair market value as it existed on the date of death."]]></content>

The government has increasingly shored up its resources for auditing high net-worth individuals and businesses to ensure they are in full compliance with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. Cash-based companies are often a target because the payment structure of these businesses may make it easier to hide income. Companies that are audited can expect IRS representatives to examine several aspects of their operations to prove compliance, according to Fox Business.

<!--more-->

A pre-audit analysis is generally agents' first task, which involves looking for clues that point to discrepancies in the owner's reporting information versus lifestyle. For example, the owner's address, DMV records and investments are typically examined to indicate potential tax fraud. If reporting information details low business income, but the owner lives in an exclusive neighborhood and drives a top-model vehicle, the IRS may be inclined to examine the case further.

During the physical meeting with the IRS agent, there will be a thorough examination of company bookkeeping to explore how sales are recorded and whether bank deposits match. The agent will also take a sample of sales invoices to match against bank deposits, Fox Business adds. There are several other areas that will fall under an agent's scrutiny, including inventory and vendor invoices as well as inflow and outflow consistency.

Lastly, other income sources, such as vending machines, kickbacks and rebates and sub-leases, will be evaluated. Business owners should ensure these additional income resources were declared to avoid potential liability.]]></content>

The new rules will affect employers' and employees' compliance with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. For example, the guidelines dictate that all service charges paid to employees under the new rules are deemed as paid by employers for FICA tax purposes. In addition, the federal tax agency released new benchmarks to differentiate between service charges and tips.

<!--more-->

In order to be deemed a tip, four conditions must be satisfied. First, tips must be made free of compulsion. Second, the customer must have the unrestricted right to determine the amount he or she leaves the employee. Third, the payment should not be the subject of negotiation or dictated by employer policy. Finally, the customer must have the right to determine who receives the payment. If any one of these conditions are not met, the money left may be deemed a service charge.

The IRS clarifies with an example. If the employer requires that parties of six or more pay an 18 percent gratuity, this amount is classified as a service charge and must be allocated toward FICA taxes for the employee. However, if there is no policy governing gratuity amounts or requirements, the money is counted as a tip.

The new guidelines also require employees who receive tips of more than $20 during the calendar month to report the amount to their employer. These tips are to be considered wages for FICA tax purposes. Tips included under the guidelines include cash tips, debit or credit card tips, and those divided by other employees in a tip-sharing program.

The new rules will go into effect on January 1, 2013. The IRS said the timeline should give business owners enough time to update their reporting systems.]]></content>

However, wealth advisors say many business owners with sizable assets have failed to take advantage of the opportunity and may pay considerably more in taxes starting in 2013.

<!--more-->

The lifetime gift exclusion is expected to roll back to $1 million on January 1, 2013, when the current federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> governing estate and gift taxes expires and new rules are put into place. Many business owners, however, are hesitant to gift such large amounts for fear that they themselves may fall short on funds in the future, according to Bloomberg. Some owners are also failing to make significant tax decisions due to uncertainty about whether the current <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax laws</a> will be allowed to expire or be renewed.

The article also cited the results of an American Institute for CPAs study, in which two-thirds of public accountants reported that less than 10 percent of clients with assets of $10 million or more have utilized even part of the current exemption.

"The global economic issues that we experienced and continue to see today have made individuals far more careful and far more concerned with deciding to part with wealth," Chris Heilmann, chief fiduciary executive at U.S. Trust, told Bloomberg. "There is an unprecedented opportunity to take advantage [of the tax break before it expires.]"

While a recent Reuters article noted that many business owners are attempting to sell their companies before the tax changes or cement their estate plans, separate data from the Tax Policy Center shows many business owners and high-net worth individuals have made no preparations for the upcoming changes. According to the nonpartisan tax agency, the number of households, businesses or individuals projected to pay estate and gift taxes will increase from 3,300 in 2012 to 52,500 in 2013.]]></content>

The Taxpayer Advocate Service - the IRS watchdog department - recently submitted its mid-year report to Congress. The federal tax agency cited tax fraud as one of the most significant issues that it faced in 2012, which may continue to hamper its processing efforts during the 2013 tax year. According to the report, the agency's fraud detection system flagged nearly two million returns as being potentially fraudulent. This is an increase of 72 percent from last year.

<!--more-->

The agency said violations of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> have become more pervasive due to several factors, ranging from a higher incidence of electronic filing, higher dollar amounts for refundable credits relating to individual returns and businesses, and unclear guidelines governing wage and withholding laws.

The IRS has named several priorities for next tax season that it hopes will help it detect and curb fraud and tax evasion. They include revamping systems to manage the impending changes to the tax code that are expected to occur in 2013, beefing up its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program to cut down on tax evasion through the use of offshore accounts, and working with other agencies to alleviate compliance challenges.

However, the IRS said eliminating delays and processing backlogs may be more difficult in 2013 due to budget constraints. The IRS petitioned to increase its 2012 budget by $1 billion, however, it was ultimately reduced by $11.8 billion. If the same reductions are carried out in future years - especially during periods of tax uncertainty - this may strain IRS processing timelines even more.]]></content>

In Estate of George H. Wimmer, TC Memo 2012-157, the IRS challenged that the gifts of limited partnership interests made by George Wimmer did not qualify under the annual exclusion gift <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. The federal tax agency asserted that because the partnership was funded with publicly traded stocks that paid dividends quarterly, they are considered "future interests." Current tax law relating to gifts requires that they be of "present interests" in order to qualify.

<!--more-->

The U.S. Tax Court reaffirmed its stance in previous cases and noted that donors must prove three scenarios in order for the transfer of a limited partnership interest to qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion. First, the partnership must generate income; second, some portion of the income must flow to donees; and third, income must be readily ascertainable.

The federal tax court found that the first and third stipulations were easily met in this case. Regarding the second stipulation, the court explained that the general partners have a fiduciary responsibility to the donee limited partners. Because one of the donees was set up as an irrevocable trust with no other assets, the court asserted that the only way it would be able to pay its income tax was if the partnership made steady distributions of income.

Therefore, the tax court ruled that due to the legal requirement to make steady distributions to the trust, all stipulations were met and the estate's gifts qualified as annual exclusion gifts.]]></content>

Businesses often face a great deal of scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service to ensure they are in full compliance with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. However, new reports show that small companies may receive more attention from the federal tax agency than larger companies, making it crucial that owners proceed with caution.

The 2011 Enforcement and Service Results report released by the IRS reveals that 1.02 percent - or 19,697 - of small businesses with assets below $10 million were audited last year. This rate, compared with the 2004 report, in which only 0.32 percent of small companies were examined, represents the highest level of business audits in the last several years. A separate study conducted by tax analysts revealed that larger entities, namely hedge funds, private equity corporations and venture capitalists, have undergone fewer audits in recent years.

<!--more-->

The disparity between the auditing of small versus large companies largely comes down to the perception that smaller businesses are more likely to inadvertently violate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax laws</a> due to the complexities of the U.S. Tax Code, according to MainStreet.com.

Small companies may lack the financial resources of their larger counterparts to effectively track expenses and retain a team of tax and legal professionals that are equipped to handle potential tax issues. In addition, as the tax landscape changes and new rules are implemented, it may be more challenging from smaller companies to revamp their databases or understand their compliance responsibilities.

For these reasons, small business owners are advised to work with a tax professional during filing season to ensure they accurately report income and understand how tax code changes may impact their returns.]]></content>

<a title="Taxpayer Wins Court Approval of Defined Value Gift Clause" href="taxpayer-wins-court-approval-of-defined-value-gift-clause/">U.S. taxpayers</a> do not realize that they are living in a period of incredible opportunity for wealth transfer and income tax planning.  They are upset by the upcoming presidential election, the looming fiscal cliff, the EU crisis, the Greek exit, and a European recession.  Their financial and legal advisors do not know whether to serve coffee or anti-depressants to them at meetings.

<!--more-->

Despite the uncertainty, however, these clients have an invaluable opportunity: to transfer wealth today at a fraction of the cost that taxpayers faced in the past.  Very low interest rates and depressed market conditions have made this the best of times, not the worst of times.  Asset prices will rise in the future, either due to inflation or improving market conditions. On the other hand, the transfer tax value of an asset today is depressed, below its intrinsic value, thereby allowing future appreciation to pass tax-free to one’s heirs.  Assets not needed for support can therefore be sold or given away <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">today</span></strong>.  Assets needed for support can be sold to one’s family for a note, bearing a low rate of interest, or transferred for an annuity.

Today, the hidden gem is therefore the opportunity to transfer assets that yield little or modest cash flow but offer tremendous potential for appreciation.  Certain planning techniques require payments to calculated using an interest rate published by IRS. In prior years, higher interest rates resulted in payments that often exceeded the asset’s cash flow, thus making it difficult or impossible to transfer these assets.  With today’s exceptionally low rates of interest, however, techniques such as GRATs, SCINs and charitable trusts permit one to transfer virtually any asset at an acceptable tax cost.

Estate planning compares the costs of holding assets until death and paying death taxes or transferring the assets today and using your exclusion.  Liquidity, that is having the cash to pay the tax, is always an issue. Imagine your heirs are presented with a tax bill after your death.  Will the heirs have to sell at less than best price or borrow from a bank with a risk premium built into the interest rate?

Depressed asset prices and low interest rates result in reduced transfer tax costs making, this the most opportune time to plan for the transfer of wealth.  What will be your legacy to your heirs?  Will your legacy be the opportunity lost or the transfer of the wealth you worked so hard to acquire?]]></content>

Undergoing an IRS audit can be stressful and time-consuming for companies. Many fear the financial backlash and potential damage that a full-scale audit with negative results poses to their reputations in the business community. However, Mark Everson, former IRS commissioner, has released guidance on what to expect and how to prepare for the examination.

Everson explains that understanding the purpose of the audit can be crucial in preparing and organizing documentation. Business audits typically surround offshore accounts, transfer pricing, executive compensation, employee classifications, and passive hobbies and activities. These areas represent the largest opportunities for unreported income and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations. Auditors are more likely to scrutinize these categories because they may give the agency the largest potential for closing the tax gap via penalties and interest.

<!--more-->

Following notification that an in-person audit will take place, Everson urges owners to gather a team of internal employees and tax professionals to ensure the parties involved are prepared to answer questions. A lack of preparation or varied responses may prompt auditors to become more thorough in their examination, which can lengthen the process.

It's also crucial to establish the scope of the examination to ensure all financial records are organized and available for the inspection. This can also prevent surprises and detours during the exam, Everson advises.

Lastly, it's imperative to meet the deadlines imposed for producing information and documentation for the IRS. Failing to adhere to schedules will not garner businesses favor with the federal tax agency and may continue to delay the auditing process. Consulting a professional to ensure all relevant paperwork is adequately prepared in a timely manner can cut down on mistakes and ensure the examination goes as smoothly as possible.]]></content>

The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Williams violated federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> by concealing more than $7 million in two foreign accounts between 1993 and 2000. Court documents reveal that the former executive opened two Swiss offshore accounts to hide his financial activities. More specifically, Williams was accused and convicted of purposely failing to fill out Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts forms, also known as Fbars.

<!--more-->

The reporting requirement was inserted into federal law decades ago, but the widening tax gap has prompted the IRS to become more stringent about these regulations in recent years. Further, the IRS has been petitioning for more financial resources to expand its tax evasion programs in an effort to catch and prosecute lawbreakers.

The recent ruling struck down a 2010 court decision in Alexandria, Virginia, that ruled in favor of Williams and set the IRS back in its efforts to curb tax evasion. Williams was convicted in a separate case involving fraud and conspiracy in 2003, to which he plead guilty. In light of his previous conviction, two judges on the three-panel court had strong remarks for Williams.

"Williams cannot now claim that he was unaware of, inadvertently ignored, or otherwise lacked the motivation to willfully disregard the Fbar reporting requirement," they wrote.

The IRS will now impose heavy penalties on Williams for his crime. According to Justice Department rules, willful failure to submit Fbar forms can result in $100,000 in penalties per instance or 50 percent of the account balance for each year of evasion. These penalties are assessed in addition to back taxes and interest.]]></content>

In a July 23, 2012 blog, Joel Kreizman, Esq. analyzed a New Jersey Appellate case where an unsigned copy of a Will was admitted to probate where the signed original was lost. The issue before the court was whether a liberal construction of the statute permitted an unsigned copy to be probated as a Will.  The statute permits a defectively executed will to be probated, but it does not provide for an unexecuted document to be probated. This decision is on appeal to the state Supreme Court.

After all, a signature distinguishes a will from a draft, does it not?

<!--more-->

The State of Nevada enacted legislation to provide for electronic wills in 2001. This  statute permitted an electronic document to constitute a will if it contained one <em>authorization characteristic</em> of the testator and if were stored and controlled by the testator (or an authorized custodian) in a manner that permits there to be only one will.  An electronic signature is typically a typed name whereas a digital signature utilizes security measures such as cryptography. Yet, as we surmise, many individuals lack the technical expertise to utilize encryption and may not be able to take advantage of the statute.   If electronic wills are intended to make testamentary planning available to the masses, how do we ensure the masses have the skill to execute successfully.  In time, perhaps, a more computer-savvy generation may be able to take full advantage of this statute.

Naturally, there is litigation.  In South Africa, an individual e-mailed his colleagues at work advising them of the location of his will on his work computer before his suicide. In the U.S., a testator called two neighbors into his home to sign on paper as witnesses to his will although the testator did not sign the printed version.  The issue was whether the version electronically stored on his computer could be probated.  Electronic wills did not eliminate litigation.

Numerous issues arise out of the imperfect execution or witnessing of a Will. There are evidentiary issues that arise in holographic and electronic settings. The electronic age of wills permits the testator to avoid execution by his or her handwritten signature and appearing before witnesses that could be called upon to testify that the individual testator signed the will.

The common thread through all of the foregoing is that not everyone will follow a prescribed path so new cases will present more of these issues, including those arising from the hacking of the electronic depository.]]></content>

Dwight Grant, better known to Philadelphia natives as Beanie Sigel, pleaded guilty to failing to file tax returns between 2003 and 2005. He originally pleaded guilty to the charges in August 2011, at which time U.S. District Judge Jan DuBois ordered that he report to prison on September 12, 2012. He will also face a year of supervised release after his sentence has been completed, during which he must pay back taxes, interest, and penalties. Failure to file penalties can reach a maximum of 25 percent, except in cases where fraud or negligence are at play, in which case penalties may be higher.

<!--more-->

The IRS noted that Sigel also failed to file returns between 1999 and 2002, save for a $10,000 tax bill he paid in 2001. Between 1999 and 2005, Sigel earned roughly $2.2 million in taxable income, and owed the federal government $728,536. However, he was not prosecuted for the violations of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> between 1999 and 2002 because the statute of limitations had expired, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Sigel told the court that he took responsibility for his crimes, but noted that during his prison stints in 2004 and 2005 for separate charges, his family members took advantage of his wealth, the Inquirer reports. He also noted that he did not live a lavish lifestyle during the periods in which he failed to pay taxes.

Sigel is the second rapper recently convicted of tax evasion, following the high profile case of R&amp;B Grammy winner Lauryn Hill, who will soon face sentencing for her own violations of tax law.]]></content>

A survey of executives at roughly 235 real estate firms revealed that if there was an immediate need to replace a CEO today, many are not prepared to name a new leader, which can have significant implications for the future of businesses. The study, conducted jointly by the Urban Land Institute and Russell Reynolds Associates, reveals that 89 percent of survey respondents lack sufficient succession plans. Of the small handful of firms that have a plan, only 48 percent review them annually.

<!--more-->

Additional findings show that only 28 percent of succession plans incorporate specific capabilities that are required for a CEO to be successful, and only 22 percent have established a formal written document that names a successor. The study's authors said the findings are disturbing and should serve as a "wake-up call" to companies.

"Senior executives need to be implementing and providing the leadership programs necessary to attract, motivate, and retain the best and brightest minds in real estate," said ULI chairman Peter Rummell. "Individual companies and the industry in general can benefit by acting strategically, proactively and decisively to plan for who's next, and to cultivate those with leadership qualities."

The authors surveyed companies of all sizes and structures, ranging from corporations to family-owned businesses. The latter category is especially vulnerable to disruptions that result from a lack of succession planning, as many family-owned companies that pass business assets to heirs also must consider gift and estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> when making decisions.]]></content>

However, the use of that law may have caused some confusion for some households.

Under the rules, when one member of the couple dies, they can pass their assets to their spouse, while using their own personal tax exemption to reduce the future taxable value of the estate. When the second spouse dies, they can use their own personal exemption as well.

<!--more-->

Prior to this law, one spouse was able to pass their assets to the other tax-free. However, the remaining spouse would only have one personal exemption to use unless they utilized Bypass Trusts or other financial planning measures.

However, as the Wall Street Journal notes, the estate administration deadlines surrounding the law mean that the executor of the estate must file the estate-tax return quickly in order to take advantage of the benefit. Should they miss the deadline, that second exemption may not be available.

"This could easily happen to the owners of a farm or small business whose advisers aren't estate-tax specialists," Tom Ochsenschlager, of American University's Kogod Tax Center, told the Journal.

The proper use of estate tax law becomes even sharper with the federal exemption still currently scheduled to drop from $5.12 million to just $1 million on January 1. While the spousal estate-tax return law would also need to be extended by Congress, analysts told the paper they expected it to remain in place.]]></content>

The IRS is cracking down on companies that misclassify employees as independent contractors in an attempt to avoid paying federal FICA taxes and providing benefits to workers. Under the current <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, employers are exempt from paying the Medicare and Social Security taxes - commonly known as FICA - that they are required to pay for regular employees. In addition, companies are not required to extend benefits, such as healthcare and retirement options, to independent contractors.

<!--more-->

For these reasons, many companies have a financial incentive to misclassify workers, but this can lead to tax penalties, taxes, and fines from the IRS. To help curb these abuses and entice companies that have misclassified workers to come forward, the IRS unveiled its Voluntary Classification Settlement Program. The program allows companies to voluntarily reclassify workers as employees, rather than contractors, for future tax years, and avoid significant liability for previous years of misclassifications.

Companies must meet several eligibility rules in order to qualify for the program, according to the Philadelphia Business Journal. For example, employers must have consistently treated workers as independent contractors and filed 1099 forms for the previous three years. In addition, the businesses must not currently be facing an audit from the IRS or other tax agency in order to qualify. Those who have undergone previous audits related to misclassifications must also have complied with the auditors' requests to be considered eligible.

The IRS has created several program recently to encourage those who have violated tax law to come forward and pay their tax burden. While the IRS has been able to recoup millions through its use of voluntary programs, the federal tax gap remains upwards of $385 billion.]]></content>

The current lifetime gift tax exemption of $5.12 million is currently set to expire at the end of the year. Because of that, many business owners have chosen to create trusts to pass their business or real estate assets to their successors before 2013 begins.

However, many in the appraisal industry told Reuters that they are seeing a surge in appraisal requests because so many business owners are attempting to take advantage of the current estate tax laws. One veteran appraiser remarked that his business is busier than it has been in 50 years.

<!--more-->

That increased demand means companies that delay too long in obtaining a valuation of their business or property may not be able to find a qualified appraiser able to meet the deadline.

"We're sort of in a perfect storm right now because the gift tax exemption is higher than it's ever been, and the value of businesses are at an all-time low, which makes it a perfect time to gift them," Karen Goldberg, president of the Estate Planning Council of Manhattan, told Reuters.

Demand is expected to increase even further following Labor Day, since Goldberg added that many business owners and executives take time off during the summer months and may not begin the process until after they return.

Appraisers told the news source that the normal turnaround time for an appraisal is anywhere from four to eight weeks. That timeline may become stretched, with the additional work creating delays. The gift tax and appraisal paperwork would need to be completed before 2012 tax returns are filed next year to take advantage of the 2012-level exemption.]]></content>

A recent poll conducted by executive search firm Witt/Kieffer found that 54 percent of healthcare CEOs have either no retirement plans in place or say they are at least five years away from stepping down. A majority said they had not even begun working with their management team to review any potential successors.

<!--more-->

"Succession planning is not on my radar yet, although I know it should be," said one respondent looking to retire in less than five years.

That expectation that they will remain in their posts and lack of succession planning were due to a number of different reasons. While more than 80 percent said they still had goals they wanted to achieve or challenges which needed to be solved, others said their plans were based on other factors.

The survey found that 52 percent did not feel that anyone in their organization was ready to take over for them, while others added that more work needed to be done in that respect. That lack of advanced planning could leave hospitals or other healthcare organizations unprepared when the time arises from both a personnel and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> standpoint.

"While it's encouraging that so many want to see through the challenges healthcare faces, these CEOs will transition out of their role at some point, and the need for succession planning in healthcare organizations is clear," said Elaina Genser, Witt/Kieffer senior vice president and western region managing director.

Plans for after their retirement varied widely among respondents. Most wanted to pursue recreational activities while others looked forward to potential options for a second career, such as teaching or consulting in the industry.]]></content>

Many officials have repeatedly said that a simplification of the corporate tax code would be a positive, including IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Geithner called the many different available tax breaks an "overwhelming source" of complications, The Wall Street Journal reports.

<!--more-->

While not a problem limited to companies operating in the United States, analysts say U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/">business law</a> can make it difficult for some firms to comprehend their tax requirements. A recent study by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers ranked the U.S. in the bottom 25 percent of 183 countries in terms of how long it would take a small manufacturer to calculate its corporate income tax.

Some tax breaks, such as bonus depreciation, are very popular, the paper reports. However, in some situations, the requirements of the tax breaks themselves also make them less advantageous for companies that do want to use them. For example, a spokesperson for USAA told the Journal that the computer modeling requirements for one energy efficiency deduction make it impractical to use, since the cost savings would not make up for the initial outlay.

The tax and compliance burdens are more severe for smaller companies in relative terms. A report from the U.S. Small Business Administration found that while companies with more than 500 employees spent an average of just $780 per employee on tax compliance, those with fewer than 20 spent more than $1,300 per worker.]]></content>

There are currently 11 Swiss banks under investigation by the U.S. government, accused of aiding wealthy American customers in violating federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> by failing to report income, according to Reuters. In an effort to remove the black mark from its banking institutions and maintain its reputation in the global financial industry, Switzerland has tentatively agreed to comply with the U.S. anti-tax evasion law, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

<!--more-->

The Internal Revenue Service has leaned heavily on FATCA to curb tax violations and prosecute corporations and wealthy individuals that fail to comply with federal reporting standards. While FATCA enforcement rules have yet to be finalized, Swiss banks' compliance with the laws is expected to be a central part of a deal being negotiated between the U.S. and Switzerland, the news source reports.

"We are prepared to sign a settlement with the U.S. for the Swiss banks today," said Switzerland Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, according to Reuters. "We feel we have made a constructive proposal to the U.S. but it is up to them to accept it or not."

In addition to negotiations with countries that provide tax havens for Americans, the IRS has also shored up its efforts to find and prosecute tax evaders despite facing budget cuts. The IRS has also enhanced its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program as a method of encouraging tax evaders to come forward and report hidden income without the fear of prosecution.]]></content>

Adopting a "set it and forget it" attitude can result in a higher tax burden and confusion among beneficiaries and heirs, both of which can endanger small companies.

Frequent reviews of business estate plans can help mitigate these oversights, and there are several steps owners can employ to ensure they have covered all the necessary components of an estate.

<!--more-->

First and foremost, it's crucial that owners have their businesses professionally valued. Low valuations are a common mistake the Internal Revenue Service examines, and this can lead to significantly higher tax bills for a company and its new heirs, according to Forbes.

Owners who want to take advantage of tax benefits and ensure their company stays in the proper hands may also consider an irrevocable trust to help them accomplish their goals. These types of trusts may allow for more flexibility regarding how a company is managed and the types of spending beneficiaries may engage in, the news source explains. Gifting property and business interests prior to 2013, when lifetime limits are expected to increase, may also help an owner limit the size of the taxable estate.

Many family-owned businesses begin integrating heirs into the company well in advance to ensure a smooth transition. However, it's equally important to draft a document outlining a company's assets and debts as a way to guide new heirs on how to manage a company's capital, according to The Business Times. This may include property ownership and values, company stock holdings and investments, insurance policies, debts, and other relevant financial data that may impact a company's value, tax obligations and success.]]></content>

A new report shows the Internal Revenue Service is leaning more heavily on a legal tool than it has in previous years in an effort to ensure wealthy individuals and businesses are in compliance with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>.

Data from the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which oversees the IRS, released new data revealing summons-related legal disputes increased to 132 in 2011, up from 44 in 2005, according to Reuters. Summonses, which require companies and individuals to release financial records, company books, and other data to the IRS, were historically utilized during an investigation. However, the IRS is now using them more heavily and closer to the beginning of inquiries than they did in years prior, Reuters explains.

<!--more-->

Further, the use of a summons, as opposed to a simple document request, carries the threat of court enforcement and the involvement of the Justice Department, a move that some analysts say is being used to speed up the process of audits and investigations, the news source reports.

Steven Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Enforcement, recently touched on the subject earlier this year at the Tax Executives Institute, and noted that all IRS agents were receiving additional training on the use of summons. Miller noted that taxpayers and companies that fail to comply with IRS-imposed deadlines for submitting documentation can expect to receive a summons, noting that they are a "normal and expected" part of the process, Reuters reports.

Despite a widening tax gap which is projected at $385 billion dollars, the IRS suffered budget cuts last year that made it challenging to reach its tax enforcement initiatives. As a result, the federal agency is investigating businesses, offshore account holders and wealthy Americans more aggressively to ensure their compliance with federal tax codes and detect potential cases of underreporting income. The renewed use of summonses may be another cost-efficient tactic that allows the agency to more deeply examine the financial paperwork and speed up the process of investigations.]]></content>

There are, however, strategies for the reluctant donor to consider.

<!--more-->
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qualified Personal Residence Trust</span> (QPRT)</strong> - this technique allows a donor to retain the right to reside in the property for a period of years of his or her choosing (the QPRT Term”).  After the end of the QPRT Term,  the donor may lease the property from the trust.  Most clients like this technique because they can act as trustees.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts</span> (GRAT)</strong> – GRATS offer the senior generation an opportunity to retain an income stream while potentially transferring appreciation to the next generation. In today’s market, a financial portfolio might offer an opportunity to retain income in the form of an annuity and transfer all future appreciation as the markets grind higher.</p>
Note: The QPRT and GRAT strategies suffer from mortality risk. If the grantor should die before expiration of the chosen term, the property comes back into the estate.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spousal Access Trust</span> </strong>– this type of trust provides the spouse with access to funds, including income and principal, without inclusion in the estates of the donor or the spouse.  There is a variation of this technique using a QTIP trust that is employed in states that do not match the federal exclusion. New Jersey is a state that “de-coupled” from the federal exclusion in 2001 leaving the state exclusion  at $675,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discretionary Trust</span></strong> – This type of trust is created by the donor for his or her own benefit where he or she remains eligible to receive distributions from a trust established in an asset protection jurisdiction.  Currently, there are thirteen such states.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Donative Promise</span></strong> – this technique is, in essence, a gift without parting with the assets. This is sure to be a favorite among some donors because it allows for reporting the transfer (gift) today and use the exclusion. This technique has received a lot of attention in recent professional publications and may become the rage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts</span> </strong>– A transfer of securities in exchange for a Note for less than the entire value of the transfer permits the return of cash (from portfolio income) to the client while utilizing the exclusion this year.</p>
There are other alternatives available; however, the ones mentioned offer substantial opportunity for those hesitant to make outright transfers or wanting to retain an income stream.]]></content>

A former mayor of the Toms River Township in New Jersey has plead not guilty to charges of tax evasion in pre-trial motions this week.

Carmine Inteso Jr., is facing several counts of federal tax evasion and failure to file personal income taxes and was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport earlier in July upon his return from a civilian contract job in Afghanistan. The government charges Inteso with accepting $291,792 in payments from an insurance broker with business interests in his town, and creating a fake company to hide the proceeds. The insurance broker associated with the tax evasion has not been listed in the case.

<!--more-->

The IRS claims that Inteso was in violation of federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> between the years 2006 and 2008. Between these years, the former mayor is being accused of withdrawing $279,000 from the "sham" company and failing to pay personal income taxes on funds received from the fake company.

"It was part of the tax evasion scheme that defendant Inteso ... (concealed) such income and purposely evade(d) the assessment of the Internal Revenue Service," the indictment says, according to NewJersey.com.

Further, the government said in a filing that Inteso willfully failed to file tax returns for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008, and currently carries a tax liability of $49,000.

Inteso has plead not guilty to the charges and was released on $200,000 bond. If convicted of the charges, the former mayor faces a maximum prison sentence of five years for each of the three tax evasion counts and one year for each of the three failure-to-file income tax counts.

The trial is expected to begin on September 19, 2012.]]></content>

Birkenfeld, who formerly worked as a UBS AG banker, received a prison sentence in 2008 after he detailed to the IRS the ways in which the bank helped thousands of Americans evade taxes. He pled guilty to conspiracy and served roughly two and a half years in prison before being released on August 1. In addition to confessing his own <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations, Birkenfeld told the IRS how UBS was able to lure wealthy clients and manage assets amounting to more than $20 billion in such a manner that they were able to avoid paying taxes.

<!--more-->

UBS agreed to pay roughly $780 million to avoid federal prosecution after admitting its complicity in tax evasion crimes between 2000 and 2007. The bank also handed over information relating to 4,700 Swiss bank accounts.

As a result, perhaps, of the admissions and subsequent investigation into the Swiss banking system, more than 14,000 clients have participated in the IRS tax amnesty program, which has allowed the federal tax agency to recoup more than $5 billion in unpaid federal taxes.

The whistle-blower reward program was enhanced in 2006 to attract more informants, and currently offers rewards of up to 30 percent of any unpaid taxes and fines recouped during a successful investigation and prosecution. The reward extended to Birkenfeld is the most significant reward ever paid out since the program's inception. Michelle Eldridge, a spokesperson for the IRS, said the whistle-blower program helps to battle noncompliance, and that the reward "reflects our commitment to the law."]]></content>

The renewed use of summonses may be another cost-efficient tactic that allows the agency to more deeply examine the financial paperwork and speed up the process of investigations.]]></content>

The IRS is cracking down on companies that misclassify employees as independent contractors in an attempt to avoid paying federal FICA taxes and providing benefits to workers. Under the current <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, employers are exempt from paying the Medicare and Social Security taxes - commonly known as FICA - that they are required to pay for regular employees. In addition, companies are not required to extend benefits, such as healthcare and retirement options, to independent contractors.

<!--more-->

For these reasons, many companies have a financial incentive to misclassify workers, but this can lead to tax penalties, taxes, and fines from the IRS. To help curb these abuses and entice companies that have misclassified workers to come forward, the IRS unveiled its Voluntary Classification Settlement Program. The program allows companies to voluntarily reclassify workers as employees, rather than contractors, for future tax years, and avoid significant liability for previous years of misclassifications.

Companies must meet several eligibility rules in order to qualify for the program, according to the Philadelphia Business Journal. For example, employers must have consistently treated workers as independent contractors and filed 1099 forms for the previous three years. In addition, the businesses must not currently be facing an audit from the IRS or other tax agency in order to qualify. Those who have undergone previous audits related to misclassifications must also have complied with the auditors' requests to be considered eligible.

The IRS has created several program recently to encourage those who have violated tax law to come forward and pay their tax burden. While the IRS has been able to recoup millions through its use of voluntary programs, the federal tax gap remains upwards of $385 billion.]]></content>

Auto companies establish plants in states where there are no unions and property taxes are less in an effort to reduce labor costs and overhead.  Despite these efforts, a business will sell its products in states where tax corporate income tax rates are high, such as California, New York and New Jersey. Businesses seek to reduce taxable income earned in high-tax states through the payment of fees paid to affiliates located in low or no-tax states such as Nevada.  The discussion of one such technique follows.

<!--more-->

Businesses with multi-state operations establish a holding company in a low-tax jurisdiction to own patents, know-how, trademarks and service marks (hereinafter “Intangibles”).  The holding company leases the right to use the Intangibles to operating subsidiaries in high tax states in exchange for a royalty payment.  The royalty payment reduces income subject to tax in the high-tax state.  This technique worked because a taxpayer must have a physical presence (Nexus”) in the state before that state’s income tax could be imposed.

The concept of Nexus evolved in the 1990s as states fought back and enacted laws that changed the definition of Nexus.  In 2003, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lanco</span></em>was decided and held that the use of intangibles in New Jersey was a sufficient Nexus to give the state the right to tax the royalty payments notwithstanding that the licensor had no physical presence in the state.  Taxpayers have been unsuccessful in their efforts to overturn the holding in <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lanco</span> </em>in the cases that followed.

The<em> New Jersey Division of Taxation</em>  has issued a notice whereby it is seeking to make it easier for taxpayers to come into compliance with current law.  Taxpayers with this issue are being offered an opportunity to come forward and incur reduced penalties.  The Division will waive all penalties except a 5% amnesty penalty.  The Voluntary Disclosure Program will look back to tax years beginning after December 31, 2003 or the date business commenced if later.  This is a considerable benefit to taxpayers because <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lanco</span>  </em>involved<em> </em> tax years as far back as 1997.  The state is also willing to consider  reaching a settlement on the application of the ‘throw-out” rule, which has been repealed.  Taxpayers seeking to make Voluntary Disclosure of Intangibles are not required to reach agreement on the application of the throw-out rule.

The Voluntary Disclosure Program represents an opportunity for taxpayers to avoid most penalties and eliminate audit risk for years before 2004.  Taxpayers should act before the expiration of the program on January 15, 2013.]]></content>

Unfortunately, one cannot speak “tax” unless one speaks in acronyms.  Therefore, this guide may be useful.

<!--more-->
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“SAT”</strong></span> means <strong>Spousal Access Trust</strong> which is a trust that is designed to transfer property out of your estate for death taxes but have access to the funds for support.  Typically, two SATs are formed and the creator of the trust names the other person as the beneficiary.  The trusts cannot be identical, but can be designed to provide substantial benefits to each beneficiary.  This technique hedges against the loss of the exclusion without losing access to all of your money.  A gift to a spouse remains in the estate of the recipient-spouse because of the marital deduction and is subject to estate tax at death.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“QTIP”</strong></span> means <strong>Qualified Terminable Interest in Property</strong> and is a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction provided the spouse is the only recipient of income and principal.  The twist is that there are rules which state that if you transfer part of the income, you have made a gift of the principal.  Thus existing QTIPs can trigger use of the Exclusion with very small gifts of income.  One use of the QTIP is to control the ultimate disposition of the trust at the death of the spouse and this does not change.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“GRIT”</span></strong> means <strong>Grantor Retained Income Trust</strong> where the grantor transfers cash or securities and retains the income stream and attempting the keep the trust assets out of his estate.  The effectiveness of GRITs was eliminated by statute which made the entire transfer a gift, unlike the prior rules which reduced the size of the gift by the right to income.  GRITs will use the Exclusion against the gift to the trust but the transferor retains access to income and principal from the trust property.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I offer a few more acronyms while omitting detailed explanations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“DING”</strong></span> means <strong>Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor</strong> trust which is designed to avoid income tax in the grantor’s state of residence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Enhanced GRATs”</strong></span> are <strong>Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts</strong> that are designed to increase the value of what is transferred to heirs as part if the remainder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Swapback SCINs”</strong></span> are <strong>Self Cancelling Installment Notes</strong> that are created to absorb the Exclusion through the division of an existing note into two or more notes.</p>]]></content>

Most notable of these benefits is that businesses are classified by the Internal Revenue Service as a flow-through entity, in which corporate income, losses, and deductions are reported on individual tax returns and assessed at individual income tax rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this allows S-Corporations to avoid double taxation on corporate income, the structure may also leave more small companies open to scrutiny from the IRS if they fail to understand or abide by federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> relating to dividends and salaries. Owners who work for their company in an employment capacity have the option of taking profits from the business and allocating them in two ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first is compensation in the form of a salary or wages, which is subject to regular payroll taxes. The second is distributions - or dividends - which are not subject to payroll tax and are taxed below the ordinary income rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Issues may arise if the IRS feels that small business owners may set artificially low wages to avoid paying as much as they should in payroll and income taxes. Further, the IRS stipulation that shareholders pay themselves "reasonable compensation" based on market rates for similar jobs in the area can leave some salary assignments open to interpretation by owners, which may complicate the scenario further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business owners who take advantage of both wages and distributions should consider conducting research into the standard salary offerings of similar positions to avoid the scrutiny of the IRS. In an era where small businesses are receiving the majority of federal audits, it may pay to be more cautious about business practices that involve taxation issues.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Building an effective <a title="Top Considerations for Small Business Succession Planning" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/top-considerations-for-small-business-succession-planning/">succession plan</a> may appear simple initially for business owners. Many companies, especially those that are family-owned, may choose to name a new leader and begin integrating that individual into business operations to familiarize them with the inner workings of a company.

<a title="succession planning" href="businesses-encouraged-to-focus-on-the-details-during-succession-planning"><img class=" wp-image-1479 alignright" title="succession planning" alt="succession planning" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/08/succession-planning-300x201.jpg" width="240" height="161" /></a>While this strategy may be a smart move, many business owners fail to focus on the small details of succession planning that can cause significant headaches for beneficiaries and heirs, according to Investment News. For example, the article notes that many owners may be too preoccupied with cultivating a new leader that they fail to consider other personnel. The ascendency of a new leader may open up additional positions for long-time veterans that should be addressed.

It can also be helpful for businesses to address issues of compensation, stock ownership and distributions, and other forms of monetary gain. Many of these topics - such as those relating to distributions and compensation - carry <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> implications that should be evaluated during the planning phase. Further, revising these figures as a company's valuation shifts or the business undergoes significant changes relating to growth and profitability is also crucial. Relying on older valuations can trigger a string of financial and tax issues when a new owner takes over.

Lastly, difficult economic times can exacerbate the transition period for businesses and leave new or inexperienced owners with few funding resources. This can be particularly difficult with small businesses, in which the head of the family and company has long-standing relationships with a bank that a new owner has not yet cultivated. Discussing different financing resources or instructing successors on strategies for overcoming liquidity issues can help companies better navigate these types of issues in the future.]]></content>

The facts were relatively simple as the parents tried to allocate income to their children, some of whom were serving overseas in the military and others lived out-of-state. The aforementioned children did not work at the ranch or contribute any capital to the partnership. As you might suspect, the taxpayers lost. Then, in 1951, Internal Revenue Code §704(e) was adopted, codifying the <em>family partnership rules of Culbertson </em>and<em> </em>addressing other issues.  §704(e) was designed to accommodate legitimate partnerships such as those investing in financial assets and real estate. Where capital is a material factor, one need only show that the party owns his or her capital account to satisfy the statutory test for a legitimate partnership.

We fast forward to the General Electric 2011 Annual Report which contained the following disclosure in footnote 14 on page 108.  It reads:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In January 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court decision which allowed General Electric’s $62Million refund claim regarding taxation of Castle Harbour aircraft leasing partnership from 1993 to 1998.</em></p>
The facts of the case are straight forward. A GE subsidiary contributed fully depreciated aircraft and two Dutch banks contributed cash to an offshore partnership in exchange for partnership interests.  GE subsidiaries continued to lease and service the aircraft.  The Dutch banks were allocated 98% of the income; however, the banks did not report this income in the Netherlands because the Dutch territorial system of taxation did not tax income earned outside its home country.  Offshore financing structures are not unknown around the world.  Instead, the banks received cash distributions on their investment account which was the sum of capital invested, plus a preferred return (8% or so), less cash distributions. Note the absence of any reference to a capital account proved fatal.

The IRS successfully sought to disregard the existence of the partnership and to force the GE subsidiary to report all of the income.

Tax doctrines, such as “family partnership rules,” but are applied more broadly than the name implies. Certainly no one would consider GE and the banks as a family.  In hindsight, could this financing structure be redesigned?

The Internet makes it easier to establish a business off-shore, share information and operate the enterprise. Perhaps the Banks could perform treasury and other functions. The downside of the <em>Castle</em><em> Harbour</em> structure was that the Banks had no appreciable upside just a fixed return. The question is whether the next version of a <em>Castle Harbour</em> structure will give the bank an upside, eliminate the use of an investment account and rely upon a capital account as one would in a true partnership.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[There are certain legal doctrines that have been developed to address state taxation of non-resident businesses. The Supreme Court created a four part test in 1977 in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complete Auto Transit, Inc</span>.  The first part was that an out-of-state business must have a “connection” or nexus to the state seeking to impose tax. In <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-0194.ZO.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quill v. North Dakota</span> (1992)</a>, the Supreme court held that an out-of-state mail order house without sales outlets or representatives in North Dakota could not be required to collect North Dakota sales tax, upholding <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/386/753/case.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Bellas Hess (1967) v. Dept of Revenue, the State of Illinois</span></a>.

<a href="the-impact-of-the-internet-upon-long-standing-rules-of-taxation"><img class=" wp-image-1585 alignright" title="online business" alt="Internet Taxation" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/10/online-business-300x225.jpg" width="270" height="203" /></a>All of us recognize the internet as the single biggest force of change in our lifetime. The Internet’s effect on the traditional notion that physical presence is required before a state may impose income tax and sales tax is a bit less obvious.  Internet retailers, without a physical presence, have hurt brick and mortar stores and state tax collections.  Today, the traditional apportionment three factor formula, payroll, property and sales in a state, is or has been revised to tax the new paradigm.  States have responded to attack revenue lost in other areas or to expand the concept of sufficient contact or nexus.

One business strategy has been defeated in court in New Jersey, South Carolina and other states.  It involves shifting income to low or no-tax states from high-tax states using tax deductible payments to siphon the income away. Many large, multi-state businesses would place their Intangibles (trademarks, patents, copyrights and know-how) into subsidiaries in no-tax states and lease the Intangibles for a deductible royalty payment designed to reduce the amount of income subject to taxation in high-tax states.

Until recently, tele-commuting employees did not create a nexus in New Jersey for their employers until the <a title="CPAs and Taxpayers Beware:  Employee Telecommuting Is Doing Business In New Jersey For Purposes of Taxation" href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/cpas-and-taxpayers-beware-employee-telecommuting-is-doing-business-in-new-jersey-for-purposes-of-taxation/">Tele-Bright</a> decision. Here, no doubt, the state was interested in expanding its reach to include businesses using remote workforces.  Again, the traditional notion of a nexus is being modified in response to the Internet.

In the international arena, the concept of a Permanent Establishment (PE) is expected to be revised. The UN, according to my colleague, <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/">Frank Brunetti, Esq.</a>, is seriously considering amending is definition to include a server or a remote office. Israel recently ruled that an investment advisor, working from his home in Israel, was performing services in Israel and not in the European office of his employer. Thus, the employer was subject to tax in Israel.

These changes in traditional definitions will eventually permit the collection of state sales taxes and may foreshadow the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT) in the U.S.  The internet has changed retailing and the workplace forever; however, taxation struggles to catch up. As our states and the federal government cry out for more revenue, the elimination of the requirement of a physical presence in order to tax is virtually certain.]]></content>

Third, the estate’s resources and the size of the potential tax refund virtually assured the case would be litigated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first point is Texas law provides that the intent to contribute assets to a Texas limited partnership is sufficient to give the partnership an equitable interest in the assets.  This holding is in line with <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Church</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline">, </span>a pro-taxpayer decision in 2001.  Unfortunately, the law of every state is not as helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second point raises a frequent issue faced by practitioners.  Every estate plan is not always promptly and successfully implemented.  All too often, people consider implementation of the estate plan to be less important.  In <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Keller</span>, </em>the widow executed the family limited partnership ("FLP") documents on May 10<sup>th</sup> with the manifest intent of contributing bonds to the FLP.  The widow died on May 15<sup>th</sup> before the market value of the bonds was obtained and signing the form to transfer the bonds to the FLP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The estate tax return, which reported the bonds as an estate asset, was filed along with an estate tax payment of $147 million.  The Executor subsequently learned that there were two issues that could help the estate recover of part of the payment.  The estate filed a refund claim citing Texas law for the proposition that the bonds were equitably transferred to the FLP. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled for the taxpayer and ordered a $115 million refund. (The other issue concerned a loan of funds to the estate which was highly illiquid).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The third point is the estate possessed a significant resources refund and could pay to litigate the case up to the court of Appeals.  Not all taxpayers have the resources to take the fight to that level.  As we move toward year-end, how many taxpayers will push the panic button and attempt to hastily implement an estate plan before the demise of the $5,120,000 exclusion?  Not all of them will be as lucky.</p>

However, those who fail to appraise gifted assets may face tax consequences if items were improperly valued.

A recent Reuters report noted that appraisers have seen a spike in business in recent months as businesses and wealthy individuals seek out services in preparation of the lucrative gift tax exemption expiring at the end of the year. The current lifetime gift exclusion of $5.12 million - or $10.24 million for married couples filing jointly - is expected to revert back to $1 million in 2013. Further, estate taxes on any amount that exceeds that limitation will be taxed at a 55 percent top rate in 2013, as opposed to the current 35 percent.

<!--more-->

In a down economy where many small businesses are struggling, more family-owned entities are paying closer attention to federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> changes as they focus on estate planning and carrying on the legacy of their businesses. In having real estate and other assets appraised, these companies are trying to avoid tax issues that may arise from placing inaccurate values on these gifts.

Industry professionals say the surge in appraisal applications has only just begun, as many businesses and wealthy individuals may still be enjoying extended vacations. However, those who plan on securing appraisal services are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, namely to ensure that they hire a professional who falls in line with IRS appraisal requirements.

At present, the federal tax agency requires that appraisers be certified by the American Academy of Appraisers and pass a variety of tests in order for their assessments to be valid. For this reason, planning ahead and working with the appropriate professionals can give businesses enough time to plan accordingly.]]></content>

Huguette M. Clark (the “Decedent”) died a resident of New York City on May 24, 2011, at the age of 104 years. The Decedent was the daughter of a United States Senator who came into office after amassing a fortune in mining and railroads. The Decedent spent the last twenty years of her life living in a New York City hospital. A cadre of private doctors, nurses and other members of her personal staff attended to the Decedent.   The hospital’s staff, relatives or outsiders had no contact with her.  The isolation of an elderly or infirm person is one of the common elements in cases of undue influence.

<!--more-->

The New York City Public Administrator (“Administrator”) was appointed as sole administrator after an insider was removed.  The estate is estimated to be worth in excess of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). Some estimates of the size of the estate are three times that amount. Unlike the matter of the Estate of Howard Hughes where a new will was offered for probate every week, there are only two wills being offered for probate.

The Administrator’s 71-page petition describes the Decedent as a recluse for decades, even before she entered the hospital at age eighty-five. The Administrator alleges undue influence by a small group consisting of caretakers and professionals. The Administrator is asking the court to impose a Constructive Trust against eighteen (18) individuals including the Decedent’s private nurses, accountant, attorney and two doctors, a group of in all.  It is common in these cases that the persons providing care replace the natural objects of the wealthy person’s bounty.

These cases may also involve changes in well-established patterns of behavior. During her years before hospitalization, the Decedent averaged $40,000 a year in gifts. In contrast, consider that one nurse received gifts in excess of $16 million. The very large gifts began to flow after Mrs. Clark lost her hearing and most of her sight. What is also striking is the disregard of the law by certain professionals. The Decedent owed the IRS $5,000,000 in Generation Skipping Transfer Taxes (GSTT) on gifts made in 2000.  GSST was imposed because the unrelated recipients are more than one generation (37.5 years) below the Decedent.  Interest and penalties were piled on top of the unpaid tax.

A constructive trust is an equitable remedy imposed by a court upon the recipient of the property. Although the recipient has possession and title, the court is ordering the recipient to hold the property as a custodian for the rightful owner, in this case, the Estate.  This case should be assigned reading to all law school students.  It will, no doubt, be the basis of a movie in the not-to-distant future.]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">Several tax evasion probes have stemmed from the bank failure and investigations span several states, including Kentucky, New York, and Florida. Matthew Morris and Allen Reichman, both of New York, were also arrested in connection with the extensive <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> probe, and all three suspects have relationships with former Park Avenue president Charles Antonucci who plead guilty to securities fraud, bribery and embezzlement in 2010. More specifically, Antonucci admitted to trying to steal bailout funds issued to the bank via the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program. The three suspects are facing several indictments for related schemes and are considered to be co-conspirators in these complex investigations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Huff, in particular, was responsible for running a payroll-servicing firm in Florida between 2008 and 2010, which was charged with managing federal tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service for three businesses. The funds that were intended for payroll taxes flowed directly through Park Avenue Bank. Rather than remitting these payments to the IRS, Huff reportedly stole $53 million in payroll tax funds to pay for homes, farm equipment, designer jewelry, clothing and luxury vehicles. If found guilty of 13 counts of tax evasion, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank robbery, the 51-year-old may face up to 30 years in prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Morris, the bank's former senior vice president, and Reichman, former executive director of investments at investment bank Oppenheimer and Co., are facing their own related charges. Morris is facing five counts of conspiracy and fraud, while Reichman faces one count of conspiracy.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Newark, New Jersey, field office for the IRS Criminal Investigation division has increased its attention on the state's businesses and high net-worth individuals in recent months in attempts to detect tax fraud and financial-related crimes, according to a new report in Accounting Today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The division specifically investigates legal source, illegal source and narcotics/terrorist financing cases. However, the agency focuses its primary attention on legal source crimes, or those in which individuals and businesses in certain industries take in legal income but engage in tax evasion-type crimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"Year-round efforts of IRS-Criminal Investigation are directed at that portion of Americans who willfully and intentionally violate their legal duty to voluntarily file lawful and accurate tax returns and those individuals who commit other related financial crimes," Victor Lessoff, special agent in charge of IRS Criminal Investigation's Newark Field Office, told the news source. "The prosecution of these individuals is a vital element in fostering confidence in our tax system and compliance with the law."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The law enforcement arm of the IRS has already named several businesses and individuals found guilty of noncompliance with federal tax law, and the group plans to increase its efforts to close the tax gap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In recent years, the IRS has faced significant budget cuts that have made it more challenging to fully realize its efforts to find and prosecute tax evaders. Despite budget cuts, the agency has increased its manpower and reorganized its resources to curb tax abuses and collect unreported income.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/10/global.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1641" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/10/global-300x231.jpg" width="270" height="208" /></a>A Senate hearing and news reports recite phrases such as “exporting jobs” and “tax gimmicks” to describe the actions of large multi-national companies.  These reports, however, do not describe the differences between the laws of the United States and those of other countries in adequate detail. These differences create inconsistencies which are perceived as gimmicks by some and as business conditions by others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I begin with background information.  First, the United States imposes taxes on the worldwide income of its citizens, resident aliens, domestic corporations, and their subsidiaries (“Worldwide Taxation”). In contrast, many foreign countries impose tax only on income earned within their borders (“Territorial Taxation”).  Second, there is an exception to the U.S.’s Worldwide Taxation of income earned by the foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation.  This provides that income earned by foreign subsidiary from an active trade or business in its country of incorporation is not taxed until the income is repatriated to the domestic parent corporation (the “Exception”).  Third, Worldwide Taxation and Territorial Taxation collide when income is taxed in both the United States and the source country. Although the foreign tax credit is intended to offset the impact of double taxation, it is an imperfect mechanism as shown in the following instances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft and Hewlett Packard were chastised for their tax practices in a September hearing before a Senate subcommittee. Senator Carl Levin stated that 90% of HP’s cash was sitting offshore. The Exception allows a United States corporation not to repatriate the income of certain foreign subsidiaries.  Instead, the funds remain offshore without paying United States tax.  This is especially true where the foreign tax credit will not protect this income from additional taxation upon repatriation.  This additional tax is required where the U.S. tax rate is higher than the foreign tax rate on that same income for purposes of computing the credit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PepsiCo funded its foreign companies as part of its 1990’s overseas expansion, using hybrid securities that were classified as debt in the Netherlands and as equity (capital) in the U.S.  Subsequently, PepsiCo received payments from these foreign companies. The character of the payments, as either a return of capital or as interest on debt, was critical for income tax purposes.  The Tax Court held that the payments made by the Dutch subsidiaries were a non-taxable return of capital rather than interest on debt. The differences between Dutch law and United States law, as to what constitutes debt, therefore created a tax anomaly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I turn now to the international competition for tax revenue, economic growth, and new jobs.  There have been discussions among members of a Congress about adopting a “patent box” regime similar to those adopted in Ireland and Malta. The United Kingdom may adopt such legislation to spur growth. The objective of such a regime is to encourage spending on research and development and the invention of products. The regime also creates high-paying jobs.  Royalties and gains derived from patents are taxed at lower rates and remain in the “patent box” or host jurisdiction for years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stock price of a publically traded company will decline in response to a dramatic increase in expenses. The company’s effective income tax rate caused by the repatriation of offshore funds is such an expense.  In a world where nations are competing against one another for economic growth, revenue and jobs, it is easy to predict where the money will or will not go.</p>]]></content>

As the favorable gift and estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> is expected change at the year's end, trusts are becoming more popular among business owners and high net-worth families as a way of lowering their tax burden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the more common - albeit complicated - trusts some are turning to are intentionally defective grantor trusts. Unlike other safeguards, IDGTs allow businesses and families to pass wealth onto children and grandchildren without reducing their liquidity, according to Forbes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The financial product, if set up properly, allows businesses and individuals to move assets out of taxable estates and transfer gains to beneficiaries tax-free. The trust may be considered "defective" due to a purposeful flaw. Assets are removed from an individual's estate, lowering the heir's tax burden, while allowing owners to continue paying income taxes on those assets. The latter essentially allows owners to gift those assets to beneficiaries at a locked-in value.</p>
One caveat that discourages many business owners from leaning on this type of trust is that it can be particularly complex and, if not structured properly, draw scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service. Further, if the value of assets declines, heirs may not gain the full benefits from this financial product. For this reason, individuals relying on a trust are encouraged set it up with a professional, have any assets appraised accordingly, and ensure they fully understand the inner workings and potential risks of these arrangements.]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman recently announced his office is reviewing the tax strategies of more than 12 of the nation's largest private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, TPG Capital, Sun Capital Partners, Apollo Global Management, and Silver Lake Partners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The strategy in question involves the process of converting management fees into fund investments to benefit from a lower tax rate. The conversion of management fees into investments triggers capital gains, which currently have a 15 percent tax rate, compared to the 35 percent tax rate for ordinary income.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This strategy may have enabled private equity firms to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Currently, industry professionals are split on whether the strategy is a violation of tax law. While a large percentage say the method is common among private equity and hedge fund firms, others consider the move to be aggressive at best or illegal at worst, the New York Times reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">However, Schneiderman is specifically focused on the scenario of firms foregoing management fees altogether and automatically classifying them as investments, Time magazine reports. While the investigation is ongoing, the news source reports that the regardless of what the state office uncovers, it does not have the authority to punish the firms for breaking federal tax law. However, if illegalities are discovered, it may prompt the Internal Revenue Service to conduct its own investigations.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bagios, a native of Greece, requested permission to travel from Florida, where he is out on $625,000 bail, to visit his ailing mother in Greece and wife and children in Switzerland. However, Judge Snow noted that given the current charges levied against him for several <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations, and the prison sentence he is facing, Bagios is considered a flight risk. Further, the former banker is experiencing difficulty meeting his financial obligations - such as rent - which may increase the likelihood that he will not return to Florida for trial, prosecutors noted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Permitting the defendant to travel to his country of origin or residence would be an invitation to flee," Judge Snow wrote in her testimony, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bagios is one of nearly two dozen bankers facing tax evasion charges from a 2008 crackdown on offshore tax violations. He was arrested in January 2011 for his role in assisting more than 150 Americans to hide roughly $500 million in unreported income from the Internal Revenue Service during his tenure at UBS. If he is convicted, he faces a five-year prison sentence for his complicity in these federal crimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Court proceedings regarding the large crackdown are still ongoing, with seven former Credit Suisse bankers being indicted last year and 50 U.S. taxpayers being charged with tax law violations, Bloomberg reports. While UBS was able to avoid prosecution through a massive $780 million payout, the bankers and other parties that facilitated the tax law violations were not.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">Prior to 2006, <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> rules required that mutual funds be restricted from investing in certain assets - such as commodities and other alternative investments - that generate more than 10 percent of their income, in order to preserve their exemption from corporate income tax, according to Reuters. However, the IRS issued 72 private letter rulings to mutual funds between 2006 and 2011 that enabled them to navigate around the restrictions and maintain their tax-exempt status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As a result, several were able to generate 100 percent of their income from commodities by setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands as controlled foreign corporations. In other instances, the mutual funds also structured the investments as fixed-income instruments, Reuters explained. To date, mutual funds have invested more than $50 billion in commodity funds via subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Lawmakers in the U.S. have called this practice into question, and the IRS is now considering whether to revoke the private letter rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"The controlled foreign corporations are corporate fictions, offshore shams, paper exercises whose sole purpose is to make an end run around the legal restrictions on commodity investments by mutual funds," said Chairman Carl Levin of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to Reuters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The impending IRS ruling will have a significant impact on mutual funds, corporate investors and commodity prices. If the tax agency revokes previous rulings, mutual funds may be forced to scale back, restructure or liquidate holdings. Despite some opposition to the tax rules, the IRS has dismissed concerns about tax evasion, and historically noted that the agency has been "very aggressive attacking sham corporations that are trying to use the (tax) code in ways that are not permissible to lower taxes in the United States."</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">In U.S. v. Quality Stores, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with a district court's earlier ruling, which affirmed that FICA taxes do not apply to non-wage payments made to employees who are terminated or laid off and allocated these payments as a form of severance. After Quality Stores issued severance packages to laid-off employees, the company withheld FICA taxes from the payments and paid its share. However, it later applied for a refund from the IRS, arguing that the payments were not defined as wages under federal law. The IRS declined the refund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The IRS provides an exemption from FICA taxes for layoff benefits in supplemental benefit plans, under the provision that payments must be attached to unemployment insurance claims and payments. Quality Stores argued that while the payments were not tied to the receipt of state unemployment compensation, the amounts were still not defined as wages because they were provided to former employees for not working, Bloomberg explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In her decision, Sixth Circuit Judge Jane Stranch ruled that the process of determining whether wages are payments for FICA <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> purposes is difficult because the rules governing these scenarios are largely undefined. However, she also noted that even though payments related to "involuntary separation, a reduction in force or a similar condition" are included a worker's adjusted gross income, it does not necessarily mean the payments are FICA taxable, Bloomberg reports.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">New research appearing in the American Accounting Association's journal, Accounting Review, found that a decline in the Internal Revenue Service's business auditing correlates with less federal taxes being paid to the government. In addition, corporations that run a higher risk of being audited may be more likely to report more accurate information in public financial statements, which could be a positive sign for shareholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"The idea that shareholders benefit from having their companies audited by the IRS may seem strange to some investors," said Jeffrey Hoopes of the University of Michigan, who co-authored both studies. "Our research, however, suggests that strict tax enforcement promotes good financial reporting and tends to check managers' proclivities to divert corporate resources for their personal use under the guise of saving taxes."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">According to the research of 5,000 businesses whose previous financial and tax records were analyzed over a 17-year span, those companies' effective tax rates increased by an average of two percentage points when the likelihood of being audited doubled. In addition, companies may have put more effort into ensuring all financial paperwork, valuations and investment portfolio information were accurate prior to filing their returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hoopes also noted that as the IRS continues to focus on companies and their tax reporting strategies to close the widening tax gap, companies may become more diligent about complying with tax law, and avoiding the types of practices that can trigger a costly and extensive audit. This is especially the case following the tax agency's most recent and ongoing probes into offshore tax havens and popular business tax loopholes.</p>]]></content>

If the existing provisions are allowed to lapse, 14.7 million of the nation's individuals and small business owners may face additional tax liabilities, making it crucial that they take advantage of the lucrative estate tax benefits before the end of year, according to life insurance trade group LIMRA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Small businesses and wealthy individuals are currently exempt from paying estate taxes on $5.12 million worth of assets - or $10.24 million if married filing jointly - and enjoy a 35 percent tax rate. Without government action, however, the estate tax exemption will revert to $1 million with a 55 percent maximum tax rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"The uncertainty that has surrounded our estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax laws</a> has made it impossible for Americans to plan for a reasonable transition of their assets to the ones they love and to charity for the greater good," said Robert Kerzner, president and CEO of LIMRA. "Today, there are three likely possibilities that Congress could adopt - if they address this issue before the end of the year - which would impact many American families and businesses."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The authors noted that Congress may renew the current $5 million exemption at the 35 percent tax rate or allow the current conditions to revert back to $1 million at the 55 percent rate. The third option may be to compromise on the estate tax rules with a $3.5 million exemption at a maximum 45 percent tax rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The study's authors noted that if the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate law</a> is allowed to expire, the average amount households and businesses will pay in estate tax is $1.4 million. As a result of these potentially high costs, tax professionals and estate planners have seen a spike in the number of businesses formulating succession plans and opening trusts to protect their assets. As the end of the year will remain busy for professionals trying to meet the December deadline, business owners with sizable assets are encouraged to satisfy their succession planning obligations quickly or run the risk of paying a large amount in taxes.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">The point of contention revolved around the concepts of equity and debt, and the use of hybrid securities that can appear to be either in certain scenarios. In PepsiCo's case, the U.S. company expanded its operations abroad in the 1990s and established a facility in the Netherlands to remain competitive with Coca-Cola, which had moved into the European and Asian markets, Reuters explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The IRS imposed a large tax bill on the company for amounts owed between 1998 and 2002, arguing that PepsiCo's Dutch payments to its parent company were considered debt interest payments from its Dutch subsidiaries, and therefore subject to corporate income taxes under U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, Reuters reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During this period, PepsiCo created hybrid securities which were treated as debt in the Netherlands, but equity in the United States. The company argued that it had an equity stake in its Dutch subsidiaries, and the payments were non-taxable returns on capital investments. U.S. Judge Joseph Goeke agreed with PepsiCo, noting that the company had used "legitimate tax planning" to establish its hybrid securities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In his complex 100-page ruling, Judge Goeke explained that PepsiCo needed to spend billions of dollars on capital investments to establish itself in European areas, and tax changes prompted PepsiCo to transfer ownership of its foreign partnerships to Dutch holding companies. As a result, these partnerships passed to the control of Dutch subsidiaries, which were then issued new promissory notes by U.S.-based PepsiCo to fund new European markets. As a result of this process, the Judge agreed that PepsiCo's characterizations of debt and equity were legitimate in the case.</p>]]></content>

When revenues start falling, some small businesses seek out areas in which they can afford to cut costs. Suspending payroll tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service should never be one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>, businesses are required to withhold payroll taxes from their employees' paychecks and match these amounts when they make payments to the IRS. When companies divert these payments, even temporarily, they violate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax laws</a> and run the risk of attracting the attention of the IRS. When this occurs, it may not only be the business owners who are held accountable, but all persons who fall under the responsible and willful definition of neglecting payroll taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In determining accountability, the IRS will typically examine several individuals and factors, including the roles of each employee, those who have the authority to sign company checks, the identity of the company's officers, directors, and shareholders, and the individuals with the power to hire and terminate employees. Individuals who control the financial affairs of a business may also fall under the "responsible persons" label, the news source explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The IRS must also prove that the responsible persons acted willfully. Willfulness occurs when individuals pay creditors with the knowledge that the IRS has not been paid. Individuals may also be guilty of acting willfully if they "recklessly" disregard a known risk that the IRS taxes were not paid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It's crucial that businesses understand that failing to investigate claims of unpaid taxes constitutes an act of willfulness, and even if they were not fully aware that taxes were not paid. The IRS has been focusing more heavily on businesses in an effort to close the tax gap, making it crucial that small businesses adhere to the tax code to avoid legal action.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Wall Street banker, who has requested anonymity to protect his career, will receive $2 million from the IRS following his cooperation and assistance in helping the IRS prosecute Illinois Tool Works for extensive <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations. According to the insider, the company enlisted the assistance of a Swiss bank to fake unauthorized tax deductions amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. The IRS said that without the assistance of the whistleblower, it is unlikely that the agency would have discovered the crime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The payout is the third seven-figure reward the insider has received under the program, following two other $1 million-dollar payments he received for assisting the IRS on separate cases. One former case helped to unveil the infamous Enron scandal, while the other has been kept secret at the whistleblower's request. Because these cases occurred prior to the expansion of the whistleblower program in 2006, payouts were capped at $2 million as opposed to the higher amounts informants can receive now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The announcement follows the unprecedented $104 million whistleblower award extended to former bank executive Bradley Birkenfeld, whose information helped unveil the illegal dealings of UBS AG. The information led to a $780 million-dollar settlement between the Swiss bank and the federal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Between 2007 and 2011, the IRS issued 729 awards, amounting to gifts of roughly $69 million to whistleblowers, according to CNN Money. In recent years, the IRS has designed several programs to crack down on tax evaders and investigate the improper use of tax havens.</p>]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anthony Young, CEO of Young Oil, was indicted on <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations this week, including a failure to pay roughly $1.6 million in taxes over a two-year period, according to Bloomberg. The charges go back to 2005 and 2006, during which periods Young is accused of failing to pay $496,000 and $1,167,000 million in taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most recent charges represent another chapter of Young's complicated legal issues that arose immediately following his company's bankruptcy petition three years ago. Young's company ran into financial issues in 2009 and was forced to file for bankruptcy. Two months after the filing, Franklin Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate found that the company had committed fraud and other violations, and owed the state of Kentucky $20 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fraud charges go back to 2008, when the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions froze the company's assets following a string of investor complaints. Young had raised roughly $20 million from investors between 1997 and 2008, but the court found that Young was misusing and misappropriating investor funds, and had defrauded and misled investors about the company, Bloomberg explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Mr. Young used his profiteering scheme to purchase a Lear Jet, an $86,000 Corvette, and various vacations to the Caribbean," Wingate wrote in his findings, according to Bloomberg. "Additionally, Mr. Young sponsored a racing company and lived a lavish lifestyle, all at the expense of misinformed investors."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joan Lloyd blocked the state's collection attempts following the company's bankruptcy filing. In addition to tax evasion charges, Young is also being sued by a U.S. bankruptcy trustee.</p>]]></content>

From Willie Nelson and Wesley Snipes to Martha Stewart - prior to being convicted of insider trading - there are several notable celebrities as of late who have violated federal or state <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> and faced heavy penalties and fines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Most recently, the California Franchise Tax Board released the names of new celebrities who are facing charges for ignoring their state tax burdens. For example, singer Dionne Warwick, who currently resides in New Jersey, has been delinquent on a $2.6 million tax bill to California since 2003, the Huffington Post reports. Although no details were released, Warwick's publicist notes that the singer has worked out a repayment plan with the state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Steven Seagal, best known for his action-packed films, is also currently delinquent on a $350,000 tax bill to the state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As many states - especially California - suffer revenue shortfalls from falling property tax revenues, budget restraints, rising medical and pension costs and municipal debt, it is likely that the state will seek out and penalize individuals and businesses that fail to pay taxes. States may begin adopting new Internal Revenue Service strategies for tax collection, which have become more aggressive as the federal agency attempts to close the national tax gap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As state and federal agencies find new strategies to increase their collection attempts, businesses and high net-worth individuals are encouraged to educate themselves on their obligations under tax law, as well as their repayment options. State and federal agencies are legally authorized to impose heavy penalties and interest rates on those entities and individuals who shirk their responsibilities.</p>]]></content>

However, the results of a new study reveal that while companies are prioritizing corporate governance strategies, many are letting business succession planning fall by the wayside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">PricewaterhouseCoopers recently released the results of its Private Company Trendsetter Barometer survey, which revealed 80 percent of private companies surveyed are adopting new and more comprehensive corporate governance practices in response to the economy. However, when identifying the main areas of governance they would emphasize, business succession came in last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Financial reporting led the charge with 73 percent of respondents prioritizing this category, while fiscal planning and regulatory compliance tied at 61 percent. Developing a long-term corporate strategy followed at 56 percent. Only 43 percent of private companies emphasized talent management and business succession as a core area of concern in their new corporate governance strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">PwC's Ken Esch notes that while today's economic environment requires companies to accurately report financial data, the failure to focus on a company's future may put them in a precarious position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"Such an environment also underscores the need for a solid leadership pipeline," said Esch. "Many private companies, however, are neglecting this issue. Although failing to identify and groom the next leader has been a historical shortcoming among private businesses, it could prove especially problematic in today's economy. Lack of a succession plan suggests uncertainty about a company's future, whereas a clearly communicated plan signals that the company is here to stay."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Developing a sound succession plan not only ensures the legacy of a private company is carried on, but also enables businesses to plan ahead and account for financial, estate, and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> issues that may arise when a private firm changes hands.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> announced that it would reopen its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP) for a third time.  The announcement was made in <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Offshore-Programs-Produce-$4.4-Billion-To-Date-for-Nation%E2%80%99s-Taxpayers;-Offshore-Voluntary-Disclosure-Program-Reopens">IR-2012-5</a>, an Information Release published on January 9, 2012.  It is significant to note that the first round OVDP in 2009 imposed lower penalties than the second round in 2010.  The third round imposes slightly higher penalties at a 27.5% rate as opposed to the previous 25% upon the highest balance held in the account.

<a href="irs-re-reopens-its-offshore-voluntary-disclosure-program" rel="attachment wp-att-625"><img class="wp-image-625 alignright" alt="" src="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/files/2012/01/5856616883_2e08acfeb6_m1.jpg" width="192" height="144" /></a>What is significant is that the IRS has collected $4.4 billion and a wealth of information from 33,000 prior disclosures. Taxpayers who have completed a disclosure know that IRS asks for the name and contact information for person or entity soliciting the foreign account or helping establish it. It is very interested in how certain programs are marketed to US persons and asks for disclosure of affiliates, related parties and the like. This is not accidental. At some point, the IRS will use the information and identify certain targets for investigation.  The question for each taxpayer who has elected to disclose is whether the information developed from other taxpayers will lead IRS to you.  Unless your account is buried in a treasure chest offshore, it is more likely than not that some other US taxpayer has disclosed his account in the same foreign financial institution as yours or has disclosed the name of the same service provider that has assisted you.  This comment, although not meant to scare taxpayers, injects a bit of reality into the deliberation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/taxation-concepts-in-conflict-worldwide-versus-territorial-2/scarinci-and-hollenbeck-201-293-0778/" rel="attachment wp-att-1737"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1737" title="Worldwide taxation" alt="" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Scarinci-and-Hollenbeck-201.293.0778-300x224.jpg" width="280" height="209" /></a>A Senate hearing and news report recite phrases such as “exporting jobs” and “tax gimmicks” to describe the actions of large <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">multi-national companies</a>.  These reports, however, do not describe the differences between the laws of the United States and those of other countries in adequate detail.

I begin with background information.  First, the United States imposes tax on the worldwide income of its citizens, resident aliens, domestic corporations and their subsidiaries (“Worldwide Taxation”). In contrast, many foreign countries impose tax on income earned only within their borders (“Territorial Taxation”).  Second, there is an exception to the Worldwide Basis of taxing the income earned by foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation.  This exception provides that income, earned by foreign subsidiary from an active trade or business in its country of incorporation, is not taxed until the income is repatriated to the domestic parent corporation (the “Exception”).  Third, Worldwide Taxation and Territorial Taxation collide when income is taxed in both the United States and the source country. Although the foreign tax credit is intended to offset the impact of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">double taxation</a>, it is an imperfect mechanism as shown in the following instances.

Microsoft and Hewlett Packard were chastised for their tax practices in a September hearing before a Senate subcommittee. Senator Carl Levin stated that 90% of HP’s cash was sitting offshore. The Exception allows a United States corporation not to repatriate the income of certain foreign subsidiaries.  Instead, the funds remain offshore without paying United States tax.  This is especially true where the foreign tax credit will not protect this income from additional taxation upon repatriation.  There is additional tax to be paid where the U.S. tax rate is higher than the foreign tax rate on that same income for purposes of computing the credit.

PepsiCo funded its foreign companies as part of its 1990s overseas expansion using <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/securities-offerings-and-corporate-disclosure/">hybrid securities</a> that were classified as debt in the Netherlands and as equity (capital) in the U.S.  Subsequently, PepsiCo received payments from these foreign companies. The character of the payments, as either a return of capital or as interest on debt, was critical for income tax purposes.  The Tax Court held that the payments made by the Dutch subsidiaries were a non-taxable return of capital rather than interest on debt. The differences between Dutch law and United States law, as to what constitutes debt, created a tax anomaly.

I turn now to the international competition for tax revenue, economic growth and new jobs.  There have been discussions among members of a Congress about adopting a “patent box” regime similar to those adopted in Ireland and Malta. The United Kingdom may adopt such legislation to spur growth. The objective of such a regime is to encourage spending on research and development and the invention of products. The regime also creates high-paying jobs.  Royalties and gains derived from patents are taxed at lower rates and remain in the “patent box” or host jurisdiction for years.

The stock price of a publicly traded company will decline in response to a dramatic increase in expenses. The company’s effective income tax rate caused by the repatriation of offshore funds is such an expense.  In a world where nations are competing against one another for economic growth, revenue and jobs, it is easy to predict where the money will or will not go.

However, the Internal Revenue Service announced the inflation adjustments for 2013, which raises the current gift tax limit.

At present, Americans are permitted to gift up to $13,000 without triggering a tax, or $26,000 for married couples filing jointly. Under the 2013 adjustment, this allowance will rise to $14,000, or $28,000 for joint filers, the increase of which may benefit business owners who utilize the gift tax law as a succession strategy for passing assets to company associates or relatives.

In addition to this change, the federal tax agency will also increase contribution limits for retirement accounts. The 2013 limit will rise from its current $17,000 to $17,500. Catch-up contributions for investors 50 and older will remain unchanged at $5,500. These increases should also be incorporated into <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business owners</a>' and affluent individuals' wealth-building and estate-planning strategies.

While these adjustments may facilitate greater transfers of wealth, tax uncertainty surrounding the impending expiration of the estate tax law continues. The current estate tax exemption of $5.12 million - or $10.24 million for married couples - is set to expire after December 31, 2012, and revert back to $1 million. Further, the tax rate on transfers above those exemptions is set to increase from 35 to 55 percent.

In response the high level of uncertainty, advisors and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com ">legal professionals</a> have reported an uptick in the number of business owners and affluent clients utilizing trusts as a strategy for keeping wealth intact and passing assets onto future generations.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Several months ago, a client placed his <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/" target="_blank">New Jersey real property</a> up for sale.  The client’s primary objective is to convert the illiquid asset into cash to be used for retirement. The client remains unwilling to accept even a remote risk of non-payment.  The client has not received an acceptable all-cash deal, so he began to entertain other types of offers.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/square-pegs-in-round-holes-the-use-of-series-llcs-outside-of-the-state-of-formation/5343253793_a4848fbe1a/" rel="attachment wp-att-1751"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1751" title="Use of Series LLCs " src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/5343253793_a4848fbe1a-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="164" /></a>An agent for a developer made an offer to a client to purchase the real property in exchange for cash and a note. The note, equal to seventy-five percent of the purchase price, would be secured by a mortgage that would be subordinated to a future construction mortgage.  If the project fails and the construction lender forecloses, the protection of the second mortgage may be negated, leaving the seller as an unsecured creditor.  The agent later disclosed that a series limited liability company (“<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/llc/" target="_blank">Series LLC</a>”) would be the entity acquiring title and executing the note and mortgage.   The client’s question to me was what does this have to do with getting paid.  The answer is everything.

A Series LLC is similar to the foreign protected cell company.  Each series may own assets but each series is not treated as a separate entity for State law purposes.  The debts, liabilities, and obligations of one series generally are enforceable only against the assets of that series and not against assets of other series or of the Series LLC.   Today, nine states, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. permit the creation of Series LLCs; however, New Jersey is not one of the nine states.   Therefore, my client cannot assume that his Note will be repaid from the assets inside the other series.

What law would a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com" target="_blank">New Jersey court</a> apply if it were to preside over a lawsuit to collect on the Note, even if the parties agreed to apply <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com" target="_blank">New Jersey law</a>?  The Series LLC was formed under the law of another state, but is this fact enough to predict the outcome of the lawsuit?  One cannot assume that a New Jersey court would enter a judgment against the other series.  Although there might be case law from other jurisdictions to guide the New Jersey court in reaching its decision; the outcome is not certain. The assets of the Series LLC are located in states other than New Jersey, so legal proceedings to collect the debt may be needed in other jurisdictions.

The <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_blank">tax treatment</a> of the Series LLC is also unsettled. There are proposed federal income tax regulations that have not been adopted. Several states have issued advisory rulings on the income tax treatment of foreign Series LLCs operating within their borders.  Although taxation of the Series LLC is not an issue for my client, uncertainty prevents nationwide acceptance.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/doomsday-prophet-sentenced-for-tax-evasion-charges/ronald-weinland-doomsday-prophet/" rel="attachment wp-att-1758"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1758" title="Ronald Weinland Doomsday 'Prophet'" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ronald-Weinland-Doomsday-Prophet-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>The "Doomsday Prophet," who gained a strong following in his native Kentucky, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for failing to pay income taxes for a number of years. U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves also fined Weinland $7,000 and ordered him to pay $245,176 in back taxes.

Weinland was convicted of tax evasion in back in June after he failed to pay taxes on $4.4 million in income between 2004 and 2010. He was able to temporarily hide income through the use of foreign bank accounts and by lying on tax forms. In addition, evidence revealed that he wrote off a number of personal expenses as church expenses. Weinland also appeared to live a luxurious lifestyle, filling his closet with designer suits and clothing and billing several trips to Las Vegas to the church.

Further, Judge Reeves noted that Weinland lied during his trial about his use of Church funds. For example, he used church donations to pay for his son's education, but purposely misclassified it as a scholarship. Further, he used church funds to purchase his son a BMW, cover his daughter's living costs and send his wife on luxurious vacations.

Despite the crimes, Judge Reeves said he received correspondence from more than 600 followers around the world, many of them requesting leniency and saying that Weinland is a generous person who would help them out financially during periods of <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">financial hardship</a>.

"It is easy to be generous with other people's money," Reeves said, according to Cincinnati News.

The 63-year-old must report to prison on January 2, 2013.]]></content>

Bae Soo "Chris" Chon, who formerly owned and operated Mirage Cosmetics, admitted to a complex scheme that allowed him to evade roughly $1.8 million in taxes from overseas sales. Rather than meeting his obligations to the Internal Revenue Service, Chon explained that he diverted these funds to foreign bank accounts. In addition, Chon understated his federal and state taxes by $522,000 for tax years 2008 and 2009.

"Chon has agreed to pay $412,404 in restitution to the IRS for federal taxes owed for the tax years 2008 and 2009, plus penalties and interest," the United States Attorney Office said. "Chon tendered two checks to the IRS on September 11, 2012 for $111,069.72 and $679,775.78, reflecting the agreed restitution and his counsel's calculation of the amount of the applicable interest and penalties, for the tax years 2008 and 2009 respectively."

In addition, Chon will be required to pay 50 percent of the highest aggregate balance he carried in his overseas accounts in 2009.

Mirage manufactures lipsticks, nail polishes, and blushes and markets the products to popular retail chains in the United States. However, the company was purchased by an international firm in 2011 for a reported $39 million, according to court documents.

The IRS has increased its efforts of late to crack down on companies that evade their tax obligations through the use of foreign accounts. In addition to working more closely with overseas banks to ensure that American clients are reporting accurately, the federal agency also developed a voluntary disclosure program for tax evaders.]]></content>

However, the Internal Revenue Service provided more clarity on the issue in a recent ruling.

The ruling reaffirms the existing <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> governing reimbursements, which states that expenses incurred by employees must have a business connection in order for workers to be reimbursed tax-free. The agency outlined several scenarios in which companies have improperly recharacterized employee taxable wages as nontaxable business expense reimbursements.

In one example, technicians' wages were reduced, but workers received the difference in nontaxable tool allowances. The company then only restored their taxable income when technicians had maxed out their tool allowances. The IRS disputed this business connection, ruling that workers always received the same gross amount regardless of whether they used their tools. The same logic was also assigned to a case involving nurses, some of whom saw their wages reduced when traveling overnight, but received the amount as a per diem to cover costs. The IRS reaffirmed that they were receiving the same gross pay, regardless of whether they incurred expenses.

The last scenario involved construction workers who were reimbursed mileage for using their personal vehicles to visit different job sites. However, the IRS took issue with this scenario, arguing that employees who didn't incur expenses traveling still received reimbursements on a frequent basis.

In order to be classified as a nontaxable business reimbursement under IRS scrutiny, employees must have incurred legitimate company expenses and been reimbursed the amounts in addition to their wages, rather than in place of their earnings.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[It seems that when Lindsay Lohan's name is mentioned in the press as of late, there is some <a href="http://www.scarincihollebeck.com">scandal</a> or court appearance that accompanies it. The "Mean Girls" star has been in trouble with businesses and authorities for several months, and now it appears that she has also drawn the ire of the Internal Revenue Service.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-seizes-lindsay-lohans-bank-account-charlie-sheen-helps-foot-tax-bill/lindsay-lohan_charile-sheen_arrest_tax/" rel="attachment wp-att-1780"><img class="wp-image-1780 alignright" title="Lindsay Lohan_Charile Sheen_Arrest_Tax" alt="" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Lindsay-Lohan_Charile-Sheen_Arrest_Tax.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>The IRS recently seized the young starlet's bank accounts to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to in back taxes. The government has responded to her <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations by placing liens on all of her accounts for failure to pay taxes in 2009 and 2010, and an unspecified amount in 2011. The 26-year-old reportedly owes the IRS a total of $233,904.

However, it pays to have friends in high places, and Lohan has received some financial support from her "Scary Movie 5" co-star Charlie Sheen, according to Fox News. The agency reports that Sheen recently cut Lohan a check for $100,000 to help her get out of her tax mess and sent the funds to her manager. The report did not say whether Sheen had gifted the amount to Lohan by asking her manager to pay the IRS directly, or simply give her the money to Lohan to make the payments herself.

The asset freeze may come at a difficult time for Lohan who is due in court on separate charges for a June car accident, a scenario that may require her to provide money for bail bond, according to the New York Daily News.

Several stars have been convicted of tax law violations in recent months, including Grammy award winner <a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">Lauryn Hill</a>, who pleaded guilty to <a href="/philadelphia-rapper-beanie-sigel-receives-two-year-sentence-for-tax-evasion/">tax evasion</a> on $1.8 million in income she earned between 2005 and 2007. The IRS has taken a hard-line on tax evasion and related violations as of late in its attempt to close the ballooning federal tax gap.]]></content>

&nbsp;

Many leaders of small, family-owned companies groom their children to take on the role of a <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business leader</a> early on. While many understand the benefits of keeping leadership within the family - such as protecting wealth and limiting their tax liability exposure - building an <a href="/businesses-encouraged-to-focus-on-the-details-during-succession-planning/">effective succession plan</a> can still be challenging.

As 2012 nears its end, and uncertainty surrounding potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> changes lingers, there are several components on which business leaders should focus to build a viable succession plan. The <a href="/house-committee-holds-hearing-on-looming-estate-tax-shift/">estate tax exemption</a> is expected to fall to $1 million from its current $5 million if the government does not extend the current rules, and the tax rate will rise to 55 percent, from its current 35 percent. As a result, the cost of transferring a business that is valued above $1 million may be more costly in 2013.

Incorporating future beneficiaries into day-to-day operations can certainly mitigate issues when they eventually take over, but employing legal and tax safeguards is also critical.

For example, existing owners should first determine the amount of wealth they want to retain, the amount to be passed on to heirs, and the available tools for minimizing estate and gift taxes when they eventually transfer wealth. Typically, most business owners rely on trusts to keep wealth intact and shielded from estate taxes. While trusts are effective in protecting family wealth, there are several types, most of which are complex and require professional assistance to set up.

However, there are a number of options which enable family-owned businesses to choose the tool that works best for their unique circumstances. Financial advisors are urging companies to cement their succession plans quickly and help mitigate the potential costs of tax law changes.]]></content>

&nbsp;

The U.S. government is putting a great deal of resources into trying to close the federal tax gap, which currently stands at $385 billion. In doing so, the U.S. Treasury Department is making agreements with several countries that house U.S. interests to curb <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations committed by American citizens that amount to tax revenue losses in the millions.

The Treasury recently announced that it has finalized its agreement with Ireland and will implement a series of protocols to help stem tax evasion, according to Reuters. The two countries announced their agreement to share <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">financial information</a> about affluent citizens' accounts being held in the countries in an effort to pick up on tax reporting discrepancies.

The implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, is slated to take place in 2014. Bilateral talks and agreements are designed as a core component in the efficiency of FACTA. In addition to its agreement with Ireland, the Treasury expressed its expectation that a similar agreement will be finalized with Switzerland in the next several days, Reuters reports.

Under the rules of FACTA, foreign financial institutions are required to report to the U.S. on American account holders with balances exceeding $50,000 or face actions that could jeopardize their participation in financial markets in the U.S. The implementation of FACTA, coupled with the IRS voluntary disclosure program - which has already allowed the tax agency to collect $5.5 billion - are expected to have a considerably positive impact on combating tax evasion.

Similar agreements have already been reached throughout Europe and among leading Swiss banks.]]></content>

However, recent rulings have demonstrated that the federal agency may be loosening its stance regarding which holdings may be included in a real estate investment trust, or REIT.

There are often disputes over whether assets are defined as "personal property" or "<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/">real property</a>." While most land has typically fallen into the latter category, the IRS may be affording businesses some flexibility on structural components, which have historically been considered personal property. As of late, the IRS has started recognizing structures - including billboards, racking and shelving, floating gaming boards, cellphone towers, and electricity transmission lines - for inclusion into REITs, according to National Real Estate Investor magazine.

Tax professional Robert Willens notes that the IRS has traditionally looked toward a component's physical characteristics to determine which category is falls into. More recently, however, the agency has been factoring in how assets are used before making its determination.

"Now the IRS is looking more at the owner's intent - does the owner intend for the component to be moved?" Willens told the news source. "The fact that it can be moved is not nearly as important as whether the owner intends to move it. It's a subtle shift, but a shift nonetheless."

For example, in a recent case, AmeriSouth XXXII, Ltd. et al. v. Commissioner [of the IRS], the IRS agreed that shelving units in apartment buildings were considered structural components and therefore classified as real property.

Analysts say that as the IRS reconsiders its stance on REITs, a wide <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">variety of assets</a> may be slated for inclusion as real property, ranging from railroad tracks to sporting venues.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/villages-government-considers-taking-irs-to-tax-court/villages_florida_irs_tax/" rel="attachment wp-att-1809"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1809" title="Villages_Florida_IRS_Tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Villages_Florida_IRS_Tax.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="118" /></a>District officials indicated they are disappointed with a preliminary IRS ruling that asserts the district is not a valid "political subdivision" under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>. As a result, the IRS does not consider the $364 million worth of recreational revenue bonds the district issued between 1998 and 2003 to be tax-exempt, according to the Orlando Sentinel. If the decision is finalized, bond buyers would owe significant taxes, bond values would fall and the district would be subject to several lawsuits, the news source explains.

The Villages are made up of more than a dozen different<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/"> community development</a> districts, and each district government is permitted to essentially operate in the same way that city and counties do. The exception is that they may not maintain their own police force or approve of growth plans, the news source explains. However, two of the districts - Village Center and the Sumter Landing - are currently in dispute by the IRS.

District governments may issue bonds, and these are typically used to <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">purchase infrastructure</a>. The decisions made regarding the bonds are typically handed over to a board that makes decisions in the best interest of the community.

The two districts in question, however, sold roughly $364 million in bonds and the decisions continue to be made by the developer, rather than an independent board. Further, the IRS alleges that the bonds were used for purchases that only benefit the developer and left residents facing millions in debt, the Sentinel reports. For these reasons, the IRS argues that these bonds are not tax-exempt.

While the federal tax agency has only issued a preliminary decision, the districts say they will wait for a final ruling before determining if they will pursue the matter in tax court.]]></content>

The names of both the informant and corporation have not been released, but those involved in the case say that the business involved is a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/">Fortune 500 company</a>. Further, the IRS refused to disclose how much it was able to recoup from the company's tax evasion activities, but given the allowance under the whistleblower program, estimates put the total around roughly $250 million. The IRS programs allows informants to collect anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of the tax amount for the information they provide.

The payment is currently the second largest whistleblower payment under the program, which was enacted in 2007 to help the IRS find and prosecute individuals and businesses that failed to comply with federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>.

In August, former banking executive Bradley Birkenfeld received the largest reward in history - totaling $104 million - after feeding information to the IRS about offshore tax evasion facilitated by Swiss banking giant UBS. The details Birkenfeld provided enabled the government to reach a settlement with UBS that required the bank to pay out $780 million for its activities.

While whistleblower cases are becoming more prevalent, they typically take years to prosecute, in many instances due to the complexities of tax evasion schemes and the number of players involved. The most recent case was filed in 2008. However, IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said in July that the agency is presently working on 10 whistleblower cases that are nearly complete, and trying to calculate the number of claims to be paid out.]]></content>

Stephen Baldwin, younger brother of "30 Rock" and "It's Complicated" actor Alec Baldwin, was recently arrested on charges of state <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations, including the failure to pay roughly $350,000 over a three-year period. The Long Island, New York, native faces up to four years in prison on the felony charges of <a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">failing to file and pay income taxes</a> for tax years 2008 through 2010.

The actor pleaded not guilty to the single count and stated his innocence in a recent telephone interview with Reuters. He also noted that he personally handed over a $100,000 check to the state during his arraignment following the arrest. Further, he argued that he had <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">bad representation</a> during the three-year period and <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2009.

"My ability to make the payment I did today, as a sign to the state and district attorney, that I'm working to get this resolved," he told Reuters.

However, prosecutors say that his failure to file and pay personal income taxes for several years has contributed to the economic shortfalls the state is facing, a scenario that has resulted in cuts to public programs and education.

Baldwin is said to be cooperating with authorities and seeking out solutions that will allow him to pay his overdue taxes and penalties without facing jail time. The actor was released on his own recognizance, and is scheduled to appear in a New York courtroom on February 5, 2013.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A federal court has upheld a ruling that allows the Internal Revenue Service to access and investigate a Florida Native American tribe's financial records for evidence that members failed to meet their obligations under <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a>.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-can-investigate-florida-tribes-financial-records-court-rules/miccosukee-tribe-florida-native-americans/" rel="attachment wp-att-1829"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1829 alignright" title="Miccosukee-tribe-florida-native-americans" alt="" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miccosukee-tribe-florida-native-americans-300x90.jpg" width="300" height="90" /></a>The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the IRS may subpoena the Miccosukee tribe's records, despite objections from its members that to do so would violate its sovereignty. Under federal tax law, the tribe itself - which conducts gaming on its lands - does not have to pay taxes to the government, but it must deduct and withhold income taxes from gambling revenues paid to individual members. Because Native Americans are American citizens, individual tribal members can be taxed.

Between 2000 and 2005, the tribe was found to be in tax law violations, which prompted the ongoing lawsuit that alleges the tribe also failed to comply with federal requirement between 2006 and 2009. The IRS is investigating whether the tribe failed to meet its withholding and reporting requirements for profits that were distributed to roughly 600 members during these years. However, the Miccosukee refused to extend access to their bank records, citing sovereign immunity. The tribe also argued that the records obtain confidential financial information and that they may be forced to change their <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/investment-banking/">banking practices</a>.

The judges rejected the tribe's arguments, noting that it chose to give its financial records to the banks, making the records the property of financial institutions, rather than the tribe.

Projections show that tribal members may owe as much as $25 million in back taxes, penalties and interest to the IRS.]]></content>

<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">Small and mid-sized businesses</a> in the information technology sector would be wise to look over the potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> implications the "fiscal cliff" could have on them in the coming year, according to an industry nonprofit.

In a white paper, CompTIA, an organization made up of various members and companies in the IT field, noted tech businesses will likely face financial adjustments due to the economic issues Congress plans to address in its upcoming session.

Specifically, the nonprofit indicated in the white paper, titled "Impact of the Fiscal Cliff on SMB IT Companies," that the removal of certain tax credit provisions may harm a number of IT businesses. Thus, CompTIA recommends these companies analyze how they can prepare.

"As Congress returns to wrap up unfinished business, I urge them to consider the impact of tax and federal policies on the domestic IT sector, which employs more than two million workers and contributes $110 billion to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/employee-benefits-erisa-group/">workers' payrolls</a>," said CompTIA president and chief executive officer Todd Thibodeaux.

One tax credit in particular that the white paper mentions is the research and development tax credit, which incentivizes the development or betterment of new technologies.

Business expensing is another facet of <a href="/estate-planning-acronyms-for-the-remainder-of-2012/">fiscal cliff</a> discussions that may ultimately affect the IT sector. As CompTIA states, Section 179 small business expensing will drop to $25,000 next year, a considerable decrease from $139,000 this year.

Members of the tech industry have requested that the White House carefully consider whether tax hikes and other regulatory changes for the IT and similar industries are needed.

Nine executives in the tech field, including Michael Dell of Dell and Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm, signed a letter to President Barack Obama recently asking that the government pass legislation to prevent spending cuts and tax hikes from taking place.]]></content>

The 42-year-old performer, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, pleaded guilty in a New Jersey courtroom to violating federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> by failing to report millions of dollars in income to the Internal Revenue Service in 2007 and 2010. The court documents indicate Cartagena earned about $1.3 million in 2007, $1.4 million in 2008, $320,000 in 2009 and $680,000 in 2010, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Court documents reveal that he owes roughly $718,038 in back taxes in back taxes, which the rapper said he intends to pay before appearing for sentencing in April. He is currently out on $250,000 bail. Fat Joe faces up to <a href="http://www.sportsentertainmentattorney.com/">two years in prison</a> and $200,000 in fines and prosecutor fees.

Cartagena is best known for his hit singles, "What's Luv" and "Lean Back." His most recent album, "The Darkside Vol. 1," was released in 2010. His attorney says he hopes his client, who is currently cooperating with authorities, will avoid jail time.

However, cooperation does not always translate into reduced jail time, as evidenced by other celebrities who have committed similar crimes. For example, rapper <a href="/philadelphia-rapper-beanie-sigel-receives-two-year-sentence-for-tax-evasion/">Beanie Sigel</a> was sentenced to two years in prison earlier in the year for failing to file returns between 1999 and 2005, and failing to pay $728,536 in taxable income. Grammy winner <a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">Lauryn Hill also pleaded guilty to tax evasion</a> in 2012 in a New Jersey courtroom. The IRS has vamped up its efforts to detect and prosecute tax evaders in an effort to close the federal tax gap.]]></content>

However, retaining the services of investment advisors, attorney and tax specialists is becoming more common among individuals of nearly all income classes.

Amid looming changes to estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> - which would reduce the current <a href="/estate-tax-change-to-affect-nearly-15-million-households/">$5 million estate tax exemption</a> to $1 million and raise the top rate from 35 to 55 percent - more wealthy Americans may be required to pay an estate tax. Once individuals factor in the cost of their homes, vehicles, investments, retirement accounts and other assets, reaching the $1 million estate limit is not as difficult as it once was. Therefore, more professionals are seeing an uptick in business from broader demographics who are planning for the future, according to Fox Business.

As the process of passing wealth becomes more complex, and consumers seek out the best trusts and investments for their unique situation, the assistance of a number of advisors may be more imperative to save money and avoid costly tax law errors.

Fox Business noted that there are significant factors affluent individuals and small business owners must consider when estate planning. The ways in which investment income and trusts will impact tax obligations is crucial to planning for a person's retirement and senior years as well as their ability to pass wealth onto future generations.

Further, Fox Business noted that a family's unique needs - such as whether beneficiary's have a chronic illness or a special financial situation - may also warrant the assistance of legal professionals when they start making estate preparations. As the end of the year approaches, professional services firms are expected to see a spike in the number of families seeking guidance, making it important that those who have not started preparations develop a plan quickly.]]></content>

Christos Bagios, formerly employed by Swiss banking giant UBS and the Credit Suisse Group, was accused of helping Americans evade millions of dollars in taxes between 1993 and 2009, a charge to which he originally plead not guilty. However, he recently changed his plea to guilty in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida. After changing his plea, he admitted to the courtroom that he was complicit - along with five other UBS bankers - in helping <a href="/irs-gives-former-ubs-banker-104-million-whistle-blower-award/">high net-worth clients hide money</a> from the Internal Revenue Service.

During this period, it is alleged that he enabled more than 150 Americans to violate federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> by shielding more than $500 million from authorities.

Bagios is a Greek citizen who spent more than 15 years in Switzerland. He was arrested in January 2011 in New York. After spending 37 days in custody, Bagios spent roughly 19 months in "conditions similar to home confinement" and received brief visits from his wife and children who reside in Switzerland, according to court documents. Following his decision to change his plea to guilty, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra granted Bagios' motion to obtain emergency travel documents to renew his Greek passport and return to his family in Switzerland as soon as practicable.

Bagios also gave up information about his co-conspirators that may help the government further its investigations into Swiss banks and prosecute additional parties. At present, 11 other banks are under investigation amid similar allegations.]]></content>

The federal agency announced that is currently engaging with more than 50 countries and jurisdictions to boost international tax compliance and strengthen the provisions surrounding the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The Treasury notes that the cooperation it has received from several foreign countries and entities has greatly facilitated its goals of finding tax evaders and lowering the federal tax gap.

"Global cooperation is critical to implementing FATCA in a way that is targeted and efficient," said Treasury assistant secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur. "By working cooperatively with foreign governments and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">financial institutions</a>, we are intensifying our ability to combat tax evasion while minimizing burdens on financial institutions."

Further, the Treasury Department noted that in addition to its initial intergovernmental model for implementing FACTA, it has recently developed a second model that will facilitate more bilateral agreements with allies. For example, an agreement has already been finalized between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, and the department is currently engaging in discussions with other countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Norway. The Treasury said it hopes to have <a href="/treasury-reaches-final-agreement-with-ireland-on-anti-tax-evasion/">finalized agreements</a> in place with these countries by the end of the year.

While the government is finalizing agreements or discussing the terms of agreements with several countries, there are still a large number of jurisdictions for which no deals have yet to be discussed.]]></content>

The owner of a popular tax agency plead guilty in a federal court to several <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax Fraud</a> violations that were carried out in several offices across Alabama and Georgia.

Bruce King, <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">owner and operator</a> of tax preparation agency Premier Tax, plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and filing false tax returns, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Alabama. In addition, Vonecia Orum also plead guilty to submitting falsified tax returns to the <a href="/irs-criminal-investigators-focus-attention-in-new-jersey/">Internal Revenue Service</a>.

Nine other defendants were also convicted of their complicity in the crimes. According to court documents, King held training sessions with employees on how to falsify tax returns to fraudulently secure larger returns for customers. Those workers who participated in the scheme filed several false returns, leading to a total loss of more than $1 million.

In addition, evidence reveals that some of the Premier Tax workers also used false dependents on tax returns. For example, a common scenario included using customers' personal information without their consent to list them as dependents on clients' tax returns. The workers who engaged in this crime are also facing identity theft charges in addition to falsifying returns and committing fraud.

Only six workers were included in the original 28-count indictment that was returned on March 28. In July and August 2011, three other employees pleaded guilty to criminal information that charged them with filing false returns.

The Justice Department has not yet released the sentences of the defendants involved in the case, or clarified about whether the investigation is ongoing.]]></content>

Due to the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA), high-net earners will see their dividends and capital gains taxes rise from 15 to 20 percent beginning this year. Moreover, while the law will keep the federal estate tax exemption at $5 million, the top tax rate of 35 percent will jump to 40 percent.

Though the estate tax is likely to affect many high-earners and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business owners</a>, a finance expert indicated <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F01%2F05%2Fyour-money%2Ffiscal-deal-ends-decade-of-uncertainty-over-gift-and-estate-taxes.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSk8Rx745Be9BjShEICONhH-w5Mw" target="_blank">ATRA will ultimately help</a> the overwhelming majority of Americans.

"You could say this eliminates the estate tax for 99 percent of the population, though I've seen figures that say 99.7 or 99.8," former Internal Revenue Service inspector Richard A. Behrendt told the New York Times.

He added that in terms of policy, the estate tax increase was implemented for a small segment of high-earning Americans - those inside the top 1 percent of earning nationwide. Trusts and other tax vehicles can also further reduce their liabilities.

One concern another finance expert, Carol G. Kroch, a managing director for wealth and philanthropic planning at Wilmington Trust, has regarding the passage of ATRA is that some high-net earners may avoid some financial planning ideas due to the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> changes. However, she noted many of these individuals "can still create that pool of wealth" via trusts, despite the estate tax increase.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/fica-taxation-of-severance-pay-may-remain-thorny-issue-due-to-conflicting-rulings/taxes3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1893"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1893" style="margin-right: 10px;" alt="tax Severance Pay " src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/taxes3-300x200.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></a>

Conflicting court rulings may lead to confusion and dispute over whether employers are required to pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax - or FICA taxes - on severance payments made to former employees.

The issue has been a contentious one, with the Internal Revenue Service asserting that severance payments are considered wages under <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> unless they meet specific conditions that would instead qualify them as supplemental unemployment benefits. Failing to meet the latter conditions would make severance payments subject to FICA taxation.

Under the narrow terms of the supplemental <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/employee-benefits-erisa-group/">unemployment benefits</a> exclusion, payments made on account of a worker's involuntary termination due to a reduction in job force or closing of a facility may not be subject to FICA taxation, according to the IRS. In addition, payments must not be made in a lump sum, but instead made in a series of payments to complement state unemployment benefits.

In 2008, the Federal Circuit agreed with the IRS stipulations, noting that severance payments that fell outside the scope of the supplemental unemployment benefits definition are subject to FICA taxes, according to Bloomberg. However, a more recent ruling by the Sixth Circuit court resulted in more ambiguity by rejecting portions of the 2008 ruling. For example, the Sixth Circuit ruled that payments made in a lump sum to employees due to an involuntary separation from employment which stems from a reduction in force or the closing of a facility are exempt from FICA taxes. The court also noted that the payments do not have to be designed to supplement state benefits to be exempt from FICA.

As a result of the most recent ruling, many employers may now consider whether to request refunds from the IRS for FICA payments made in previous years. However, if the IRS chooses to appeal the ruling, it may continue to cause confusion.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/advisory-panel-urges-irs-to-combat-identity-theft-in-its-tax-fraud-efforts/identity-theft-business/" rel="attachment wp-att-1901"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1901" style="margin-right: 10px;" alt="Identity Theft-Tax-Fraud" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Identity-Theft-Business-300x262.jpg" width="210" height="183" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service has funneled a significant amount of resources toward combating <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> violations. However, some argue that the federal agency is not paying equal attention to another important crime that is connected to <a href="/tax-agency-owner-pleads-guilty-to-multi-state-tax-fraud-crimes/">tax fraud</a>.

The IRS Advisory Council's 2012 annual report offers up several suggestions, including a recommendation to focus more attention on combating identity theft, which often leads to tax fraud. The group noted that by focusing too heavily on seeking out tax evaders and tightening its compliance standards, it was missing out on the opportunity to detect and prosecute identity thieves that have committed other costly <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax-fraud crimes</a>.

"The IRS must continue to diligently look for ways to combat identity theft which leads to tax fraud," said the panel. "The IRSAC commends the IRS on its two-pronged effort, but is concerned that both taxpayers and the tax system will suffer if appropriate measures are not taken quickly and effectively to control this fraud."

Identity theft is a crime that affects roughly 11 million Americans of all income brackets each year. The report argued that failing to address the issue in the present would lead to higher costs in the future as the crime becomes more prevalent. Over time, this may divert resources away from other pressing tax issues, and strain the shrinking IRS budget even more.

The advisory panel noted that by working more closely with banks and financial institutions, they could more closely manage the risk of identity theft and help stem the crime. The IRS has already partnered with several financial institutions and formed agreements with a number of countries to ensure compliance with U.S. tax law. The IRS said stronger relationships with <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">banking institutions</a> may help it detect federal tax crimes and help close the growing tax gap.

A South Carolina state legislator was found guilty of misdemeanor <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax evasion</a>, but will face no jail time.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/lawmaker-found-guilty-of-tax-evasion/tax_evasion_tax_fraud/" rel="attachment wp-att-1930"><img class="wp-image-1930 alignright" title="South Carolina Lawmaker Found Guilty of Tax Evasion" alt="Tax Evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Tax_evasion_Tax_Fraud-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a>

Representative Kris Crawford was charged with <a href="/tax-agency-owner-pleads-guilty-to-multi-state-tax-fraud-crimes/">failing to file tax returns</a> from 2004 and 2007 in a timely manner. His 2004 taxes were filed in 2007, his 2004 and 2005 taxes were paid in 2008, and his returns for 2007 were filed in 2008.

Crawford argued that he depended upon his <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">accountant </a>to file his returns for him and did not actively or purposely <a href="/former-ubs-banker-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-charges/">violate tax law</a>. However, a jury came back with a guilty verdict for Crawford after prosecutors argued that he failed to ask questions about his returns, even following several issues with his state income taxes, The Associated Press reports.

Crawford, who was recently re-elected to a fourth term, will be required to pay a $10,000 fine, but will face no jail time. He originally faced one year in jail and $10,000 for each count.

Crawford, who is also an emergency room doctor and father of four, turned himself in on the misdemeanor charges in April 2010, and fully cooperated with authorities during the duration of the trial. The case was tried in court last year, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict, resulting in a mistrial. In a phone call with the AP, he said that he is happy with the outcome of the case and glad the trial is finally over.

"It certainly provides closure I can live with," Crawford told the AP. "I look forward to getting back to work for the people who elected me twice amid all of this and look forward to continue treating my patients."

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/reit-investments-spike-due-to-relaxation-of-tax-rules/reit_investments_trust_accounts/" rel="attachment wp-att-1954"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1954" alt="REIT_Investments_Trust_Accounts" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/REIT_Investments_Trust_Accounts-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a>

&nbsp;

More investors have begun incorporating <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/">real estate investments</a> trust into their portfolios as the Internal Revenue Service takes a more relaxed stance on how REITs are structured for tax purposes.

Strict rules surrounding these accounts previously excluded <a href="http://www.dkirealestate.com/">individual investors</a> and small businesses from this type of investment, and instead only opened them REITs up to large institutional investors. In recent months, however, more baby boomers who are trying to bolster retirement income, as well as <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">small businesses</a>, are showing more interest in these funds and utilizing them for wealth-building purposes, according to Forbes. In addition, more companies are converting to an REIT structure to gain tax benefits.

This is primarily because the IRS, in recent months, has taken a more flexible viewpoint regarding what qualifies as real property, and this relaxation has enabled more companies to convert to this structure. As more businesses can include structures, such as billboards, shelving, cellphone towers and other infrastructure as real property, <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/is-commercial-leasing-starting-to-rebound-in-new-jersey/">investing in real estate</a> has become more profitable for all involved. Further, an expansion of the REIT industry enables investors to continue diversifying their portfolios in an era where <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> changes and uncertainties have made investors skittish, Forbes reports.

While the IRS has relaxed its standards of what may qualify as an REIT, some uncertainty still lingers. For example, the federal tax agency has not yet ruled whether solar farms would qualify as an REIT. The solar industry has been hurt recently as a result of some notable bankruptcies, but is still viewed by many investors as an up and coming industry.

However, as the IRS continues to further clarify these definitions, there may be a shift where businesses and individuals invest.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Reversal of Tax Decision</h3>
&nbsp;

Two former Ernst &amp; Young attorneys won a reversal of a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax decision</a> that convicted them of developing illegal <a href="/irs-held-to-three-year-timeline-to-audit-tax-shelters/">tax shelters</a> from 1999 to 2001.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a decision that convicted Martin Nissenbaum and Richard Shapiro of creating unlawful shelters at the accounting firm to help <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/">wealthy individuals</a> evade <a href="/treasury-department-works-with-more-than-50-jurisdictions-to-stem-tax-evasion/">federal taxes</a>, citing a lack of evidence. However, the court reaffirmed the conviction of Robert Coplan and Brian Vaughn, who were sentenced to 36 and 20 months in prison, respectively. The panel also affirmed the conviction of investment advisor Charles Bolton, but ordered a reduction of his fine.

The defendants were accused of costing the <a href="http://scarincilawyer.com/">government </a>roughly $2 billion in taxes by helping those individuals with more than $10 million in taxable income create paper losses using fraudulent scenarios, Reuters reports. This enables the losses to be taxed at a capital gains rate, rather than ordinary income rate, the news source added.

The investigation was started shortly after the accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, started a new team to develop tax shelters that would target high net-worth individuals, according to The Associated Press.

They were convicted in 2010 for tax law violations, and Nissenbaum and Shapiro were also charged with obstructing the Internal Revenue Service. Ernst &amp; Young was not charged in the case, as lawmakers say they cooperated with authorities.

While tax shelters are legal, the IRS has been focusing heavily on these tax-advantaged strategies as of late in an attempt to detect potential <a href="/former-ubs-banker-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-charges/">tax evasion</a> and close the growing tax gap. As a result, the federal agency has partnered with many countries and banks to provide more transparency in the account and reporting processes of investors.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Estate Tax Increase puts U.S. Farmers at Risk</h3>
Family-owned businesses and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">high-net worth individuals</a> are bracing for a potential hike in <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal estate taxes</a>, but U.S. farmers are an overlooked segment that are expected to be particularly impacted by this scenario.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-tax-puts-farmers-assets-at-risk/estate-tax-us-farmers-wheat-field/" rel="attachment wp-att-2003"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2003" style="margin-bottom: -8px;" alt="U.S. Farmers to be impacted by estate tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/estate-tax-US-Farmers-Wheat-Field-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a></h3>
If lawmakers choose not to reinstate the Bush tax cuts,<a href="/fiscal-cliff-deal-has-various-estate-tax-implications/"> federal estate tax</a> rates are expected to increase to 55 percent from its current level of 35 percent. In addition, the exemption will drop from $5 million to $1 million. The new rates coupled with rising prices for land have farmers in the Midwest concerned about whether the existing <a href="/americans-involve-more-professionals-in-the-estate-planning-process/">estate tax law</a> will be extended, and some are already preparing for the worst-case scenario.

Many farmers are speeding up their succession land and quickly putting their assets into trusts or making gifts at an accelerated pace, according to agricultural news website the Capital Press.

"Some people are going to make gifts they normally wouldn't have until later," Kerry Arritt, an <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">accountant</a> in Burley, Idaho, told the news source. "It will cost their heirs a few million dollars if they wait."

In other cases, some farmers are concerned that they may be forced to sell off significant shares of land in order to pay their taxes, according to The Associated Press. In some areas, such as Iowa, land prices have tripled in value, greatly increasing the amount of estate taxes some families will be subject to, the AP adds.

Further, analysts noted that the "big farming" industry is now simply the "farming" industry in most areas, and that many agricultural plot owners are not millionaires, but farmers who inherited small plots of land through previous generations. As a result, these landowners are most likely to be negatively impacted by the changes if they fail to succession plan now.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tax Filing Season will Start January 30, 2013</h3>
Last year was a significant one for many individuals who made key changes to their finances and investments in anticipation of the fiscal cliff. However, those who want to see how these changes will impact their <a href="/core-elements-of-an-effective-succession-plan/">tax liability</a> may have to wait longer than usual due to the Internal Revenue Service's recent announcement that it will delay the start to tax filing season to January 30, 2013.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season/tax-filing-season-delayed/" rel="attachment wp-att-2020"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2020" style="margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="Tax Filing Season Delayed" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Tax-Filing-Season-Delayed-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>The IRS made the announcement on the heels of the <a href="/fiscal-cliff-deal-has-various-estate-tax-implications/">fiscal cliff</a> deal reached by lawmakers, which resulted in several key changes to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> and made certain benefits and rates permanent. In response, the federal agency said it must delay the start of filing season to take the new laws into account. Meanwhile, it will begin updating forms and completing programming and testing of its processing systems. The delay is likely to affect roughly 120 million Americans of all income demographics who file income tax returns.

However, <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/judge-approves-solyndra-bankruptcy-plan-despite-objections-from-federal-agencies/">the IRS</a> said the delay may have more of an impact on those who file more complex returns and claim certain tax benefits. For example, those claiming residential energy credits, depreciation of property or general business credits may experience a longer wait time after submitting their returns as the IRS may require more time to process extensive forms and update systems.

"We have worked hard to open tax season as soon as possible," said IRS acting commissioner Steven Miller. "This date ensures we have the time we need to update and test our processing systems."

However, individuals should keep in mind that the filing deadline is still April 15. Although taxpayers may have to wait longer to file, they may benefit from using the additional time to take into account the tax law changes made on January 2. For example, the estate tax law was made permanent and sets the lifetime exemption at $5 million for individuals - or $10 million for joint filers - and a tax rate of 40 percent. As these terms will not experience fluctuations in the future, the new year may be a good time for individuals to begin making concrete decisions regarding their estate planning.]]></content>

An elderly heiress and charity benefactor pleaded guilty in a Florida courtroom to sheltering tens of millions of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service in an offshore account.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/millionaire-guilty-offshore-tax-evasion/tax-forms-us/" rel="attachment wp-att-2048"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2048 alignright" style="margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="Offshore Tax Evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Offshore-Tax-Evasion-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></h3>
Mary Estelle Curran, 79, admitted to violating <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal tax law</a> by failing to report more than $43 million that she hid in a number of <a href="/u-s-considers-punishments-for-foreign-banks-that-aid-in-americans-tax-evasion/">offshore accounts</a> in Switzerland and Liechtenstein between 2001 and 2007. The large amount of money she was able to hide from authorities makes the case one of the largest of its kind.

Curran is well-known in her Palm Beach community not only for owning a luxury home estimated at $3 million dollars, but also for her considerable <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=charitable+contributions">charitable contributions</a>. She has provided funding to several organizations of the years, including the Opportunity Inc. Early Childhood Center and the Rehabilitation Center for Children and Adults. She inherited the offshore accounts from her late husband, who passed away in 2000.

Curran will be forced to pay roughly $21.7 million in tax penalties following her admission of <a href="/tax-agency-owner-pleads-guilty-to-multi-state-tax-fraud-crimes/">filing false tax returns</a>. She will also be required to file amended tax returns for the years in question and pay $667,716 in overdue taxes, penalties and interest. In addition, the heiress faces up to a maximum of six years in prison. Sentencing will be held on March 29, 2013.

This tax evasion lawsuit is one of many that have been taken up by the Justice Department and the IRS in recent years, as it cracks down on unlawful offshore account activity. Currently, the two federal agencies are investigating dozens of individuals who have used offshore accounts as a safe haven for hiding income from the IRS.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Steering Clear of Wealth Transfer Dilemmas</h3>
The estate planning is a multi-layered process that requires individuals and business owners to be well-versed on <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>, wealth building and <a href="/irs-raises-gift-tax-limit-for-2013/">transferring assets to beneficiaries</a>. However, an often overlooked planning component involves making sure that executors are also educated on the process and able to meet a person's wishes.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/avoid-wealth-transfer-issues-executor/estate-planning-books/" rel="attachment wp-att-2063"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2063" alt="Educate Your Executor to Avoid Wealth Transfer Issues" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Estate-Planning-Books-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></h3>
An executor is the person responsible for properly carrying out the terms set forth in the will. This is not always an easy process when dealing with complex estate issues, such as debt, taxes, considerable wealth and assets and trusts. To ensure that wealth is effectively passed on to beneficiaries without issues, it's important that individuals ensure their executor is informed. This includes disclosing their financial condition, including outstanding debts.

A common problem than often arises is failing to inform executors about the location of important paperwork and documents they will need to carry out the policyholder's wishes, Fox Business reports. As a result, <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/">paying creditors</a>, resolving tax issues and distributing wealth to heirs can be delayed. To avoid these issues, individuals are encouraged to set up a meeting with their executor whether it's a spouse, family attorney or relative to identify assets and accounts and provide any security information they may need.

Lastly, it's important for those with significant assets to <a href="/americans-involve-more-professionals-in-the-estate-planning-process/">assign some assistance to executors</a>, such as an attorney or accountant. Executors who face a complex estate may be more likely to make mistakes that can lead to tax issues, personal liability or probate problems. Ensuring the executor has a professional to consult can mitigate these risks and ensure wealth is passed on to heirs quickly and efficiently.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The IRS  is within its rights to request financial records from UBS of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">U.S. taxpayers</a> suspected of hiding their income in accounts with Swiss bank Wegelin, a court ruled.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-seek-bank-records-from-ubs/ubs-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2084"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2084" style="margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="IRS to Seek Bank Records from UBS" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IRS-to-Seek-Bank-Records-from-UBS-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>U.S. District Judge William Pauley granted the Internal Revenue Service a motion to issue a "John Doe" summons - which requests information about possible <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=tax+fraud">tax fraud</a> committed by individuals whose identities are not known - on UBS. Following the guilty plea and subsequent closure of Switzerland's oldest bank Wegelin, which admitted to helping U.S. clients skirt their U.S. tax law obligations, Pauley said that the IRS request was valid, as many UBS taxpayers may have hidden their income at Wegelin and other Swiss banks.

Following the ruling, a UBS spokesperson that the bank would comply with the request, and offer up information on U.S. clients. However, it noted that it would only provide U.S. records, not Swiss ones, to the federal tax agency, according to Reuters.

Although <a href="/former-ubs-banker-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-charges/">UBS was previously absolved of its own tax law violations</a> in 2009 after it admitted to helping Americans evade taxes and agreed to a $780 million settlement, its association with Wegelin has put it back in the spotlight. Wegelin pleaded guilty on January 3 to helping <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">U.S. clients</a> hide income in secret accounts, and became the first foreign bank to be indicted by the U.S. A spokesman for the bank also raised eyebrows and make other banks nervous when he admitted that facilitating tax evasion was a common practice among many financial institutions. The 271-year-old institution agreed to pay $57.8 million in fines.

Wegelin is just the latest bank on the list of Swiss institutions the IRS is examining in connection with tax evasion as it seeks to crackdown on the misuse of offshore accounts and close the federal tax gap.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Former football star O.J. Simpson is facing a slew of legal issues and the latest involves a hefty <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax debt</a> owed to the <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a>.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/o-j-simpson-owes-tax-debt-to-irs/" rel="attachment wp-att-2115"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2115" style="margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="OJ Simpson Owes Half a Million Tax Debt to IRS" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/OJ-Simpson-Owes-Half-a-Million-Tax-Debt-to-IRS-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" /></a>

Simpson, who is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence in Nevada's Lovelock Correctional Center after a 2008 conviction involving kidnapping and armed robbery, has reportedly skipped out on paying more than half a million dollars in taxes. The IRS <a href="/unpaid-federal-taxes-lead-to-federal-tax-liens/">filed a lien</a> for $179,435.07 for the years of 2007 to 2010, and the <a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/california-extends-film-tax-credit/">State of California</a> says Simpson still owes $318,566.04 for the year 2000. Another federal lien filed by the IRS in December 2012 details an additional tax debt of $17,015.99 in taxes for the year 2011, and marks the third tax lien filed against Simpson in the past 12 months. Overall, Simpson owes $515,017.10 in taxes.

Imprisonment does not absolve Americans of their tax law obligations, and the IRS will continue to seek the unpaid amounts from Simpson. In addition to his tax woes, Simpson is also on the hook for millions of dollars owed to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman related to a civil lawsuit they won after the former star was acquitted of the double murder. The 1997 civil court judgment against Simpson ordered him to pay the families of those victims $33.5 million.

As Simpson is already serving a prison sentence - nine years of which he is ineligible for parole - and owes millions of dollars to the families of his slain ex-wife and her friend, it is uncertain how effective the IRS liens will be in recouping these tax debts. Simpson is far from the first celebrity to face punishment from the IRS for unpaid taxes. A number of other high-profile stars, such as Lauryn Hill, have also faced prosecution for failing to meet their tax obligations.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Avoid Tax Compliance Issues</h2>
There are a number of perks to hiring independent contractors for jobs, rather than relying on salaried employees. However, there can also be potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> missteps related to issuing forms to freelance workers, making it important for <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">business owners</a> to tread cautiously around <a href="/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season/">filing season</a>. Failing to comply with federal tax guidelines could result in penalties, audits and damage to a company's reputation, all of which can be costly for small business employers.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2133" alt="Business Owners Avoid Tax Compliance Hang-ups Related to Independent Contractors" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Business-Owners-Avoid-Tax-Compliance-Hang-ups-Related-to-Independent-Contractors.jpg" width="251" height="203" />To avoid drawing the ire of the <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a>, it's important that company owners not only issue 1099 forms to both independent contractors as well as non-corporate service providers. This means that businesses that paid at least $600 for services during 2012 to any service provider, be it a sole proprietor or partnership, must issue Form 1099-MISC to these entities no later than January 31, 2013. One source of contention that can cause confusion and lead to potential tax law issues is a stipulation regarding corporations. Business owners are not required to provide Form 1099-MISC to corporations. However, owners are required to provide this form to attorneys or medical service providers who do business as corporations, the American Accounts Payable Association elucidates.

Another common scenario that can be harmful to small business owners is failing to issue tax documents in a timely manner. The AAPA reminds that business owners sending Forms 1099-MISC to the IRS by mail should do so no later then February 28. Companies that relay these documents electronically will need to submit them by April 2.

Lastly, business owners should err on the side of caution when sending out documentation. Complying with evolving <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax laws</a> can be confusing for many owners, and it may be a positive idea for them to work with a professional to better understand their obligations. However, if owners are confused about whether they should send out Form 1099, it may be a smart idea to send one out, as failing to do so may result in penalties in certain scenarios.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="/irs-seek-bank-records-from-ubs/">Wegelin and Co.</a>, the oldest bank in Switzerland, will soon shut its doors following a guilty admission for helping American clients <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">evade U.S. tax law</a> by hiding more than a billion dollars in income from the <a href="/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a>.

Otto Bruderer, an official at the 270-year-old Swiss institution, entered the guilty plea on the bank's behalf in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, New York. The bank was the first Swiss institution to be charged amid federal officials' extensive investigations into offshore banking and tax law violations. The bank was found<a href="swiss-bank-guilty-clients-evade-taxes"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2149" alt="Oldest Swiss Bank to Close After Pleading Guilty to Helping US Clients Evade Taxes" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Oldest-Swiss-Bank-to-Close-After-Pleading-Guilty-to-Helping-US-Clients-Evade-Taxes-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> guilty of one count of conspiracy in which it helped more than 100 Americans hide more than $1.2 billion from the IRS. The bank entered into a plea agreement with U.S. federal officials which will require them to pay $20 million in restitution, $15.8 million for fees on undeclared accounts and $22 million in fines. The agreement between officials and the bank is pending court approval and sentencing is expected to take place on March 4.

Following the agreement, the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">financial institution</a> said it "will cease to operate as a bank," according to BBC News. The decision to close its doors and sell off assets was largely due to the criminal accusations and the bank's desire to protect its non-U.S. clients.

In addition to pleading guilty to tax evasion, Bruderer allegedly admitted that while the practice of helping clients evade taxes was "wrong," he noted that it's a common practice in Switzerland, the BBC reports. In response, the Swiss banking community has expressed concern over the possibility that heavier investigations and penalties may be imposed on Swiss banks as the U.S. cracks down on tax evasion and offshore accounts.

"Some Swiss financial analysts are already speculating that Wegelin's $58 million fine, which many had expected to be higher, was kept low by the U.S. authorities in return for Wegelin clearly implicating the rest of the Swiss banking community in tax evasion," said BBC correspondent Imogen Foulkes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Foreign financial institutions that shelter Americans' <a href="/swiss-bank-guilty-clients-evade-taxes/">offshore funds</a> will now be required to comply with the final rules on FATCA issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.

The federal officials announced that they have finalized regulations relating to U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law compliance</a> and <a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2169" alt="Government Issues Final Rules on FATCA" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Government-Issues-Final-Rules-on-FATCA-300x159.jpg" width="300" height="159" /></a><a href="/irs-seek-bank-records-from-ubs/">offshore accounts</a>. The groups said that many of the rules relating to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act did not differ from those outlined in 2012, but that they took constructive criticism from foreign governments and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/">financial institutions</a> into account, after concerns arose that FATCA was too extensive and would only complicate reporting.

"These regulations give the administration a powerful set of tools to combat offshore tax evasion effectively and efficiently," said Neal Wolin, the deputy Treasury secretary."The final rules mark a critical milestone in international cooperation on these issues, and they provide important clarity for foreign and U.S. financial institutions."

The final rules will require U.S. and foreign entities to phase in timelines for due diligence, reporting and withholding and align them with the intergovernmental agreements, and also refine and clarify the treatment of investment entities. The new rules also seek to expand and clarify the scope of payments not subject to withholding, and outline the compliance and verification obligations of foreign financial institutions. Additionally, the rules require that countries sign intergovernmental agreements that better facilitate cooperation between countries.

Many nations have already forged agreements with the U.S. to prevent future incidences of tax evasion. For example, Norway recently joined six other countries – Denmark, Ireland, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom – in reaching an agreement with the U.S. on implementing FATCA. In some countries, banks will provide information on U.S. accounts to their own governments, while financial institutions in other nations will report directly to the IRS.]]></content>

Matthew Thomas, Himanshu Patel, and Mathilde Guetta, three former bank clients, brought the suit against UBS claiming that the Swiss bank did not meet its obligation to inform them that they had to declare their accounts to the IRS and pay any taxes owed. The clients eventually chose to participate in the IRS' Voluntary Disclosure Program, and were required to pay their taxes plus interest and a 20 percent penalty.

The case was first brought before U.S. District Judge John Darrah, who dismissed the case last June. In the most recent ruling, the court asserted that no breach of contract or failure to perform fiduciary responsibilities existed on the part of UBS.

"The plaintiffs are tax cheats, and it is very odd, to say the least, for tax cheats to seek to recover their penalties from the source, in this case UBS, of the income concealed from the IRS," U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner wrote in the ruling, according to Bloomberg. "This lawsuit, including the appeal, is a travesty."

In 2009, UBS faced punishment for its admitted role in helping thousands of <a href="/former-ubs-banker-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-charges/">U.S. clients evade taxes</a> and <a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">hide income in offshore accounts</a>. Although no criminal charges were pursued, the Swiss bank was forced to pay a settlement of $780 million to avoid further prosecution. It has since released thousands of names and account information on U.S. accounts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Small businesses and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/">affluent individuals</a> have no doubt missed the intense scrutiny the <a href="/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> has ramped up recently. It also appears that more thorough examinations are likely in the future, albeit in a different format.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/audit-by-mail-more-common-with-irs/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2191" alt="Audit-by-Mail to Become More Common for Businesses and Individuals" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Audit-by-Mail-to-Become-More-Common-for-Businesses-and-Individuals-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Although the IRS is aggressively trying to close the $385 billion <a href="/reverses-ernst-young-tax-decision/">tax gap</a>, it lacks the financial resources and manpower to conduct full-scale audits of those companies and individuals it suspects of skirting U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>. In response, the agency is instead scrutinizing returns more closely via its audit-by-mail program, according to the Maryland Capital Gazette. The news source notes that tax audits have surged in recent years, and of the 1.5 million audited returns of 2011, roughly 75 percent were correspondence audits completed by mail. In these audits, the IRS generates a mailed notice to taxpayers requesting that they substantiate some information on their returns.

Although these audits may seem expedient, and are typically processed more quickly than in-person examinations, it's still important that <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business owners</a> and affluent households treat them with the same level of seriousness that they would another type of IRS inquiry. An improperly worded response or document stream may invite closer scrutiny that could turn into a full-scale audit with IRS officials. In many cases, taxpayers may go into too much detail when answering these questions, which can also lead to additional inquiries. For this reason, it's important that business owners with significant financial interests rely on a professional who understands the complexity of tax codes and regulations.

Consulting a tax attorney may provide the type of clarification and guidance needed to clear up any issues before they evolve into more serious legal issues.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The publisher of an annual tax report that influences the Internal Revenue Service's <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> policies recently released a critical report about the agency's Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/national-taxpayer-advocate-ovdp/"><img class=" wp-image-2202 alignleft" alt="National Taxpayer Advocate Report Criticizes 2012 OVDP Changes" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/National-Taxpayer-Advocate-Report-Criticizes-2012-OVDP-Changes-300x199.jpg" width="240" height="159" /></a><a title="National Taxpayer Advocate Bio" href="http://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media-Resources/National-Taxpayer-Advocate-Bio" target="_blank">Nina Olson</a>, head of the National Taxpayer Advocate, critiqued some of the changes the IRS made to its OVDP program in 2012, arguing that the agency was not doing enough to combat tax evasion and other violations, according to Forbes. The OVDP is a partial amnesty program that offers <a href="/swiss-bank-guilty-clients-evade-taxes/">tax evaders</a> reduced litigation and penalties if they come forward with their crimes. Since the program's inception, it has collected more than $5 billion in <a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">offshore taxes</a> from Americans.

In the report, Olson argues that the IRS is unfairly penalizing taxpayers who have a "reasonable cause" defense. Reasonable cause refers to a scenario in which taxpayers did not willfully neglect to file taxes or file them properly due to circumstances beyond their control or other mitigating circumstances.

In addition, Olson also criticizes the IRS for including an "opt-out" option in 2012, a rule that was not permitted in previous years. The benefit enables taxpayers with reasonable cause defenses to enter the OVDP program, and then opt-out at a later date in the hopes of paying a smaller penalty, Forbes reports. The report states that by allowing benign taxpayers to opt-in and opt-out of OVDP programs, the IRS is increasing the cost and burden of correcting past tax violations and increasing the processing times of those who opt out to roughly 550 days.

Further, the report notes that while the IRS continues to arbitrarily prosecute tax evaders through the program, it has halted several programs designed to educate Americans with offshore accounts or those who are living abroad of their reporting obligations under U.S. tax law. Olson noted that misinformation and a lack of clarity and resources are strong contributing factors to the growing number of tax law violations, a scenario for which the IRS is partially responsible.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Court Makes Decision on Tax Licensing Case</h3>
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia recently ruled the <a href="/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> did not have the authority to license independent <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax preparers</a>. However, the <a href="/national-taxpayer-advocate-ovdp/">IRS</a> said it plans to appeal the decision, a move that may affect as many as many as 700,000 professionals who file their clients' <a href="/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season/">tax returns</a>.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-appeal-tax-licensing-decision"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2216" alt="IRS to Appeal Court's Tax Licensing Decision" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tax-calculator-pen-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>At the center of the issue is the federal tax agency's latest tax licensing effort, which would have required independent preparers not affiliated with<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com"> large corporate entities</a>, such as H&amp;R Block, to pass a competency test and follow several new regulations and rules. These changes would have taken place under the IRS's newly created Registered Tax Return Preparers Program.

The IRS noted that too many mistakes were being made by independent agents which were causing delays and higher expenses. The federal court quickly struck down the IRS' rules, which would have imposed a new annual application fee and continuing educational requirements on independent preparers. The RTRP program requirements would have started on January 1, 2014, and attorneys, certified public accountants and enrolled agents would be exempt from the policies.

Judge James Boasberg's ruling also included an injunction that prohibited the implementation of the RTRP program.

The IRS said it will appeal the decision, noting that discontinuing the program "would result in a substantial disruption to tax administration," according to Bloomberg. The agency also noted that hundreds of thousands of independent preparers are responsible for more than 80 million returns each year, and failing to set standards can open the door to costly errors and inadvertent tax law violations. The IRS has taken several measures to both elucidate on the tax code and reduce tax evasion, both of which are designed to help close the $385 billion tax gap.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Grammy winner and R&amp;B artist Mary J. Blige is facing a host of financial issues that recently culminated in a $900,000 <a href="/o-j-simpson-owes-tax-debt-to-irs/">tax lien</a> being placed on her home.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/mary-j-blige-tax-lien/"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2228" alt="Mary J. Blige Faces Tax Lien on New Jersey Mansion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mary-J-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>The state of New Jersey imposed the lien on Blige's 18,250-square-foot mansion in Saddle River after Blige violated <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> by failing to pay back taxes. She bought the home with her husband in 2008 for the price of $12.5 million, and quickly ran into <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">financial issues</a> trying to make the annual $100,000 property tax payments. The French country-style home features an indoor movie theater, fitness center, gourmet kitchen and eight bedrooms, according to AOL Real Estate. The lien is not the only issue the top-selling artist is facing.

She is currently facing a lawsuit from Bank of America, which sued the singer after defaulting on a $500,000 loan. The bank said she took out the loan in 2005 and stopped making payments in 2012. In addition, Blige's former landscaper is also suing the singer for $4,000 in <a href="/fat-joe-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-2/">back tax payments</a>. In May 2012, the New York Post reported that Blige's charity, which is designed to empower women, failed to file tax returns for the last several years, and is missing hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. Further, the organization defaulted on a $250,000 loan from TD Bank.

"The problem is that I didn't have the right people in the right places doing the right things," Blige said of the charities problems, according to the Post.

In all, the singer and her husband are on the hook for more than $3 million in defaulted mortgages. In an effort to overcome these financial woes, Blige dropped the original $14 million asking price of her New Jersey home - which has been on the market since 2011 - to its valued $12.5 million.]]></content>

When it comes to <a href="/avoid-wealth-transfer-issues-executor/">dividing up an estate</a> among heirs, many <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/">affluent individuals</a> and business owners balk at leaving one child more assets, cash, or property than their other children for fear that it will cause sibling rivalry. However, when<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com"> business interests</a> or family heirlooms are involved, this may be the best policy.

Changes to the estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> allow individuals to leave $5.25 million - or $10.5 million for married couples filing jointly - to heirs in 2013, up from $5.12 million in 2012. The <a href="/irs-raises-gift-tax-limit-for-2013/">gift tax</a> exclusion also increased to $14,000 for singles and $28,000 for couples, compared to 2012 limits of $13,000 and $26,000, respectively. As business owners may now transfer larger portions of their estates to heirs without triggering a tax, it's important to make objective, rather than emotional, decisions regarding wealth transfers, according to recent article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Many business owners hand down family assets in an effort to further their legacy and continue to build wealth for future generations. Splitting up assets evenly among several children can lead to family squabbles about how to manage assets, a scenario that could eventually diminish wealth. In addition, those who have different ideas about how to run the company or simply want no stake in it at all could sell their shares or make other decisions that impact a company's future.

For these reasons, business owners are advised to take the competency and future goals of each heir into consideration before handing over a sizable portion of the estate. If one member is better suited to handle day-to-day operations than another, splitting assets evenly may not be a smart move. In addition, working with an estate attorney to create trusts designed to keep assets within the family is another move that may prevent heirs from selling off or jeopardizing a company's future.]]></content>

The Platinum-selling rapper served most of his two year sentence for possessing illegal firearms, and was recently escorted by U.S. Marshals to another institution to serve the remainder of his sentence for tax evasion. The Associated Press noted that the rapper still has time remaining on his 28-month sentence for <a href="/fat-joe-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-2/">tax evasion</a>, which ran concurrently with his gun crime. Ja Rule has been in protective custody during this jail stint due to his <a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/">celebrity status</a>, and may be eligible for transfer to a halfway house after six months in prison, the AP reports.

The rapper currently owes the Internal Revenue Service roughly $1.1 million in back taxes, penalties and interest. Once he is out of prison, he will also face one year of supervised release, the AP said.

Ja Rule plead guilty to illegal gun possession in 2010 after a .40-caliber semi-automatic gun was discovered in his vehicle during a traffic violation. One year later, he also plead guilty for failing to pay nearly $3 million in income taxes between 2004 and 2006.

"I in no way attempted to deceive the government or do anything illegal," he told the judge, according to the AP. "I was a young man who made a lot of money - I'm getting a little choked up - I didn't know how to deal with these finances, and I didn't have people to guide me, so I made mistakes."

Ja Rule is included with a number of celebrities residing in New Jersey who have been prosecuted for failing to meet their <a href="/o-j-simpson-owes-tax-debt-to-irs/">tax law obligations</a>, such as <a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">Lauryn Hill</a> and, most recently, <a href="/mary-j-blige-tax-lien/">Mary J. Blige</a>.]]></content>

A federal U.S. Tax Court handed down a ruling that bars Bank of New York Mellon from claiming millions of dollars in foreign tax credits arranged by Barclays. The case involves complex <a href="/reverses-ernst-young-tax-decision">tax shelters</a>, known as Structured Trust Advantaged Repackaged Securities, which essentially generate artificial tax <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">credits for companies</a>. The IRS has argued against six banks that have participated in this practice, namely because the complexity of these arrangements can leave a great deal of room for potential <a href="/irs-appeal-tax-licensing-decision/">tax law violations</a>.

The tax court agreed with the IRS and noted that the transaction was the result of "pre-arranged steps designed as a subterfuge for generating, monetizing and transferring the value of foreign tax credits among the STARS participants," according to the Financial Times.

"The Stars transaction was a complicated scheme centered around arbitraging domestic and <a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">foreign tax law</a> inconsistencies," the court added.

BNY Mellon said it plans to appeal the ruling, but will accept after-tax charges amounting to roughly $850 million as a result of the court decision.

"We will appeal the court's decision," a spokesman said, according to the Washington Post. "We continue to believe the tax treatment of the transaction was consistent with statutory and judicial authority existing at the time."

The court ruling may carry long-term tax implications for other banks that have drawn the ire of the IRS for this practice. The U.S. banks in question that entered into Stars transactions with Barclays participated in these deals between 1999 and 2006. As the IRS seeks to close the $385 billion tax gap, the deals of the other banks the IRS is examining amounts to roughly $2 billion.]]></content>

In the coming weeks, lawmakers are expected to ask U.S. banks to begin disclosing information on <a href="/national-taxpayer-advocate-ovdp/">foreign clients' accounts</a>, which will then be handed over to those foreigners' home governments, according to a special report from Reuters.

The suggestion has already prompted a backlash from U.S. banks, but the Treasury Department argues that it may serve as a quid pro quo scenario to help further the information-sharing agreement between the U.S. and other <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/federal-government-cracking-down-on-trade-secret-theft/">foreign governments</a>. The terms of the <a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA</a>, will go into effect this year, but many countries - most notably France, Germany and China - are pushing back against U.S. authorities for more reciprocal information-sharing terms. These countries have argued that if their banks have to tell the IRS about Americans' secret accounts, then U.S. banks should have to reciprocate by disclosing more information about the U.S. accounts of French, German and Chinese nationals, Reuters reports.

Under the current agreement, non-U.S. banks, investment funds and other financial entities are required to disclose information on American accounts whose balances exceed $50,000. Those who fail to comply with FATCA may be prevented from participating in U.S. markets.

"The United States is committed to a policy of transparency and equivalence, where appropriate, in furtherance of international cooperation to combat offshore tax evasion," said a Treasury spokesman, according to Reuters.

The U.S. is facing a tax gap of $385 billion, a large projected percentage of which stems from tax evasion and other unlawful activity from offshore account holders. The U.S. is currently working with a smaller budget for catching tax evaders, but has continue to ramp up efforts by bolstering existing voluntary disclosure programs and forging deals with other nations to help detect and prosecute those who skirt federal tax law.]]></content>

However, new guidelines proposed by the <a href="/?s=Internal+Revenue+Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> may shift some of the liability onto third-party payroll providers, employer organizations and employee leasing companies when violations occur.

The IRS determined scenarios in which a payer who is not a direct employer may - for tax purposes - be considered an agent of the employer, and therefore face some tax liability when it comes to employment taxes. For example, the proposed regulations assert that a payer can be designated as an agent of an employer in regards to <a href="/struggling-to-meet-business-costs-dont-neglect-payroll-taxes/">employment taxes</a> when they've entered into a written or oral agreement to perform the employer's employment tax obligation, according to Business Finance Magazine. The following conditions must be met for this agreement to be valid: The payer must verify that it is the employer or co-employer of individuals performing services for the client; <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">compensates the individuals for services they performed for the company</a>, and assumes responsibility to collect, report, and pay employment taxes.

When these conditions are met, the IRS proposes that liability for employment taxes must also apply to third-party payroll services, not solely the company that retains workers. The only exception to these proposals states that payers may not fall into this category when filing taxes for a company under its Employer Identification Number (EIN).

Companies face a great deal of tax liability when it comes to managing payroll and independent contractors, even when service providers are involved. Therefore, it can be helpful for companies to consult with professionals to better educate themselves on their rights, responsibilities and liabilities under federal tax law.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Family limited partnerships (FLPs) and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/llc/">limited liability companies (LLCs)</a> are useful vehicles with which to transfer wealth.  A membership interest in an LLC and a partnership interest in an FLP partnership are often referred to as Units. The value of Units for estate and gift tax returns is fair market value (FMV).  Where there is no established marketplace for the sale of Units in closely-held LLCs and FLPs (hereinafter, collectively, “LLCs”) one must obtain an appraisal.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/state-law-does-matter-part-1/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2304" alt="State Law Does Matter (Part 1) " src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tax-300x120.jpg" width="300" height="120" /></a>An appraiser takes note of the fact that is no market and that the owner is often unable to force the LLC to redeem the Units.  Unable to convert the Units into cash makes them worth less than their  <i>pro rata</i> share of the LLC’s assets. Certainly, the FMV of the Units is less than one hundred cents on the dollar and forms the basis for any discount. A key component of the discount is the inability of the Owner to force redemption of the Units. Everyone assumes they are entitled to a discount but seldom understands the basis for it.

The impact of state law went unnoticed until the decision in <i>Auriga Capital Corp. et al. v. Gatz Properties, LLC</i>.  The decision caught the attention of practitioners within and without Delaware, because the trial Court definitively ruled that traditional <a href="/ubs-owes-no-money-to-tax-cheats/">fiduciary duties</a> of care and loyalty apply by default to managers of Delaware <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">limited liability companies</a> absent a contractual provision that clearly alters or eliminates such duties On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court, acting <i>en banc</i>, affirmed the trial court's award of damages and attorneys' fees, but squarely rejected the "[trial] court's pronouncement that the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act imposes 'default' fiduciary duties on upon LLC managers and controllers unless the parties to the LLC Agreement contract that such duties shall not apply.”  Fortunately, Delaware acted quickly to resolve this question.

If there is a duty of care and loyalty imposed by state law, it stands to reason that the value of the Units will be higher than if there were no such duty.  Do you know if state law governing your LLC permits your agreement to eliminate the duty of care and loyalty?  Does your appraisal assume that the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court is the law in your state?

State law still matters for <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal estate and gift tax valuations</a>.]]></content>

Many people are <a href="/us-banks-disclose-foreign-account-info/">implicated in crimes due to information</a> they post on social media websites, and one woman who committed tax fraud has the posts she made on Facebook to thank for her prosecution. An ongoing IRS investigation into the nearly two million-dollar tax fraud case of Rashia Wilson has been largely facilitated by posts she made on <a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/facebook-like-button-patent-lawsuit/">Facebook</a>, according to CPA Practice Advisor magazine. Officials say Wilson - a self-proclaimed <a href="/ja-rule-tax-evasion/">income tax fraud pioneer</a> who instructed others on how to to defraud the IRS - made a number of comments and posts on the social networking site that eventually led to searches of her home, her computers and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/facebook-sponsored-stories-lawsuit-highlights-evolving-right-of-publicity/">Facebook accounts</a>.

For example, in one post, Wilson presented an image of herself smiling with an oversized jewel-encrusted pendant and hoards of cash. She also included a caption that sought to mock the IRS.

"YES I'M RASHIA THE QUEEN OF IRS TAX FRAUD," the post read, according to CPA magazine. "IM' A MILLIONAIRE FOR THE RECORD SO IF U THINK INDICTING ME WILL BE EASY IT WONT I PROMISE U!"

Seven months following the post, Wilson was indicted on 57 counts of tax fraud, the news source reports.

Information publicly posted on social media websites has been increasingly used in legal matters, ranging from tax investigations to divorce proceedings. Although privacy laws may exist regarding social media content, information that is posted publicly is generally fair game in court cases. The IRS is establishing a stronger network for detecting tax law violations, ranging from technological advancements to catch reporting errors to global agreements made to limit offshore banking abuse.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[During the <a href="http://youtu.be/pwkw0EUPnF4">recent presidential election</a>, the issue of American citizens with bank accounts overseas was regularly addressed, as many people accuse these account holders of skirting around <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">certain taxes</a>. However, a recent agreement between <a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/treasury-foreign-bank-account-swiss"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2328" alt="Treasury Reaches Agreement with Swiss Regarding Foreign Bank Account Info" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Treasury-Reaches-Agreement-with-Swiss-Regarding-Foreign-Bank-Account-Info-300x172.jpg" width="300" height="172" /></a>the the Department of the Treasury and Switzerland allows the government to <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1853.aspx" target="_blank">access pertinent information</a> on citizens with these types of accounts.

"Today's announcement marks a significant step forward in our efforts to work collaboratively to <a href="/us-banks-disclose-foreign-account-info/">combat offshore tax evasion</a>," said Acting Treasury secretary Neal Wolin. "We are pleased that Switzerland has signed a bilateral agreement with us, and we look forward to quickly concluding agreements based on this model with other jurisdictions."

The Treasury said it believes the agreement will go a long way in bolstering the <a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA)</a>. This <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/frank-l-brunetti/">tax law</a> initiative was passed in 2010 and targets non-compliance from taxpayers who have foreign bank accounts in their name.

The Swiss government and banks in the country are expected to face scrutiny in the wake of this agreement. A cornerstone of <a href="/swiss-bank-guilty-clients-evade-taxes/">Swiss financial institutions</a> is the privacy is offers its clients, but initiatives, such as FACTA put these policies at risk.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. has entered into agreements with several countries to help curb the incidence of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a> on the part of Americans. While many <a href="/swiss-bank-guilty-clients-evade-taxes/">foreign banks have admitted</a> to facilitating Americans in hiding income, the U.S. government may soon set its sights on two Israeli banks for <a href="/treasury-foreign-bank-account-swiss/">complicity in tax evasion</a>.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/israeli-banks-target-tax-evasion/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2340" alt="Israeli Banks May Be Target of US Tax Evasion Case" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Israeli-Banks-May-Be-Target-of-US-Tax-Evasion-Case-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Zvi Sperling, an American, is facing charges from federal prosecutors for <a href="/us-banks-disclose-foreign-account-info/">hiding taxable income</a> in offshore accounts in Israel. During Sperling's guilty plea, he noted that he had conspired with workers at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank - or Bank A, in the court documents - and Bank Leumi Le-Israel - or Bank B - to hide income from the IRS, according to Bloomberg. A representative at Leumi declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but no Israeli banks have yet been charged.

"The bank has a long-standing policy of not discussing customer relationships," Orit Reuveni, a spokeswoman for Bank Leumi, told Bloomberg in an email. "We have previously stated that we are among the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">international banks</a> within the scope of a U.S. inquiry into tax matters involving U.S. customers."

Sperling, who co-owns a business with his brother, failed to disclose his offshore assets between 2003 and 2010, Bloomberg reports. According to court documents, he set up back-to-back loans between the banks and created an offshore account with the sole intent of hiding income and making it difficult for U.S. authorities to detect the income, Sperling said in his plea agreement. The news source notes that Sperling held roughly $4 million in his offshore account, the amount and interest earnings of which he never reported.

No charges have yet been brought against the two banks, but federal authorities have no ruled out a case.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Chris Zorich, the former lineman for the Chicago Bears, plead guilty to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax evasion</a>, including failing to file federal income taxes for four years.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/chicago-bears-chris-zorich-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2349 alignright" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="ex nfl star financial troubles tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ex-nfl-star-financial-troubles-tax-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" /></a>The <a href="http://www.sportsentertainmentattorney.com/">ex-NFL</a> star allegedly failed to file federal returns between 2006 and 2009, and is also being charged with generating income relating to work for his charity, deferred payments from the Bears, work for a law firm and appearance fees, according to NBC Chicago. In addition, he received $3,000 each month from the charity he founded in 1993 - the Zorich Foundation - the payments of which are supposedly related to the home office Zorich kept to manage the foundation's records, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Although Zorich is said to be cooperating fully with federal prosecutors, he faces $100,000 for each of the four counts as well as up to four years in prison. Zorich has requested that potential prison time be reduced to probation. In addition, he explained that his cousin, Barbara Singer, previously handled both his personal finances and tax accounting, as well as the finances of his charity foundation. Singer was diagnosed with cancer and passed away in 2008, the Tribune notes. Zorich's representatives said that while it doesn't excuse his failure to file his taxes, Singer's death did contribute to the majority of his <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">financial troubles</a>.

The case marks the second time that the former Bears player has been in hot water with federal authorities. Zorich was scrutinized in 2012 after $350,000 went missing from his charity organization, and Zorich's bank records failed to shed light on how the funds were appropriated. Although he denied misusing the funds, he promptly promised to pay the unaccounted funds. In addition, he was barred from taking a leading role in charities in the state of Illinois, the Tribune reports.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Retired automobile magnate James "Jimmy" Pflueger will return to federal court on tax law violations that include several counts of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax fraud</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2356" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Tax-Fraud-Lawyer" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tax-Evasion-Fraud-Lawyer-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" />Pflueger is being accused of using <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business assets</a> for personal gain, falsely reporting his income on his tax returns in Hawaii and California, and hiding his <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">assets overseas</a>. The 86-year-old allegedly misconstrued the profits he made on the sale of his San Diego, California, commercial property in order to secure more funding for legal judgments in an unrelated court case. Further, prosecutors argue that he also lied about payments made from his business, Pflueger Inc., that were used to cover personal expenses between 2003 and 2006.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The case may involve complex and sophisticated methods of prosecution due to a number of witness on both sides of the dispute, according to the Hawaii Reporter. For example, Pflueger's estranged wife, Nancy testified that her husband paid all of her personal expenses after her bills were sent to the car dealerships - either Pflueger Acura or Pflueger Honda. She also testified that Pflueger had their joint tax returns prepared without her knowledge or signature on them, according to the news source. As a result of these allegations, the court is considering calling in a handwriting expert to determine if the returns were forged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy Pflueger has plead not guilty to the charges, and claims that his accountant and dealership committed the tax crimes without his knowledge or participation. However, some family members and people close to the retired auto dealer - such as Pflueger's son, Charles Alan, who runs the <a href="/avoid-wealth-transfer-issues-executor/">family business</a> - have already pleaded guilty to similar charges, the newspaper reports. As a result, this may hurt Pflueger's claims of innocence.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has been trying to close the multibillion-dollar <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax gap </a>through voluntary disclosure programs, amnesty initiatives and a <a href="/audit-by-mail-more-common-with-irs/">higher number of audits</a> in recent years. However, the recent across-the-board spending cuts that reduced the operating budgets of several federal agencies may have an impact on the tax agency's ability to go after tax law violators, the IRS reports.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-reports-sequester-may-mean-fewer-audits/sequester-tax-audits/" rel="attachment wp-att-2363"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2363" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Sequester Tax Audits" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sequester-Tax-Audits-212x300.jpg" width="212" height="300" /></a>In a staff memo obtained by ABC News, IRS Commissioner Steven Miller wrote that the spending cuts would not impact individual and business tax return processing or refunds. However, employee furloughs, reduced hours and fewer resources to train IRS workers may result in fewer audits as they will have less staff to perform the reviews, he noted. However, reduced auditing may only impact individual filers and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">self-employed business owners</a> rather than corporations and offshore tax evaders.

The IRS has entered into a number of agreements with foreign governments to help them combat tax evasion committed by Americans, which may allow them to keep up their efforts without draining their budgets. In addition, those with offshore accounts typically offer the biggest potential for chipping away at the tax gap at a more significant level.

However, the sequester also impacted another area that greatly facilitated the detection and prosecution of <a href="/voluntary-disclosure-program-enabled-irs-to-collect-5-billion-from-offshore-tax-evaders/">offshore tax evaders</a> and corporate tax law violations: the <a href="/wall-street-banker-receives-2-million-via-irs-whistleblower-program/">whistleblower program</a>. The agency announced it will be cutting whistleblower rewards by 8.7 percent as a result of the cuts. Some analysts argue that the reduction may discourage informants from coming forward, which could lead to lost opportunities for the agency to catch violators and recoup lost income, interest and penalties.

The furloughs are expected to go into effect during the summer, following the end of tax season.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has encouraged Americans to help it detect and prosecute <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a> by offering <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">financial incentives</a> for those who alert the agency to <a href="/chicago-bears-chris-zorich-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">tax-related crimes</a>. However, the agency is considering lowering these incentives in the future, which may affect how many people come forward.

<a href="http://www.taxtrustestatenews.com/lowering-incentives-whistleblowers/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2369" alt="" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IRS-Considers-Lowering-Financial-Incentives-for-Whistleblowers-300x110.jpg" width="300" height="110" /></a>Acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller recently proposed to shrink the existing provisions of the IRS Whistleblower program, and suggested a number of changes in regards to which types of money qualify for rewards. Under the existing program, those who alert the IRS to <a href="/israeli-banks-target-tax-evasion/">tax evasion</a> can collect a reward that ranges between 15 and 30 percent of any proceeds brought in as a direct result of a tip. However, the tax evasion must involve at least $2 million in funds or apply to an individual making at least $200,000 per year, the New York Times reports.

Under the new proposals, whistleblowers would face difficulties obtaining rewards that stem from a corporation's inflation of losses, the Times notes. In addition, informants would be wholly excluded from rewards related to money from Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBARs) violations, the newspaper added.

However, many lawmakers say the proposal - if implemented - may deter Americans from coming forward with knowledge of tax violations. Further, many analysts noted that the IRS has failed to make good on several of the previous assistance they have received from informants. For example, the IRS has received more than 1,960 claims since 2006, but paid its first claim in 2011, the Times reports.

The IRS has not yet gone through with any of its proposals and has not yet announced when or if it will decide to pursue a stricter whistleblower policy. Currently, it has not let up on its efforts to use various resources to detect tax law violations, including new agreements with several countries across the globe for more transparency and reporting on Americans' foreign accounts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tax season is officially here, and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business owners with independent contractors</a> and employees should not misclassify workers to avoid attracting the ire of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-clamps-down-on-businesses-that-misclassify-workers/irs-business-owners/" rel="attachment wp-att-2380"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2380" alt="irs business owners" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/irs-business-owners-270x300.jpg" width="216" height="240" /></a>In an effort to <a href="/irs-reports-sequester-may-mean-fewer-audits/">close the tax gap</a> and ensure full compliance with federal tax law, the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">IRS is focusing more closely on business tax returns</a> and, specifically, the way in which companies classify workers. The agency has been cracking down on businesses that misclassify workers as <a href="/tax-compliance-independent-contractors/">independent contractors rather than employees</a>, and the penalties for doing so can be steep. In many cases, hiring independent workers can be more cost-effective for companies. Companies are not required to withdraw payroll, Social Security and Medicare taxes, provide benefits or pay unemployment insurance. However, if the IRS determines that employers have incorrectly labeled workers, they may be forced to pay up to 100 percent in payroll taxes owed to the IRS, according to Fox Business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, the IRS has audited or is in the process of auditing 6,000 companies in the crackdown mission, the news source reports. The IRS estimates that at least 30 percent of workers are currently misclassified, and resolving this issue could yield as much as $7 billion in revenue, Fox Business adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because the IRS has a strong financial incentive in cracking down on misclassified workers, it's important that companies know the difference between who qualifies as a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/labor-and-employment-law/">contractor versus and employee</a>. For example, workers who set their own schedules, utilize their own tools to complete a job and provide services to other businesses are generally classified as independent contractors and should be issued 1099 forms, rather than W-2s. However, when companies control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job, as well as how they paid, the hours they work and the benefits they receive, individuals may fall under the employee classification.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dozens of American taxpayers who disclosed the details of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">secret offshore accounts</a> with Bank Leumi le-Israel in exchange for <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">criminal amnesty</a> may no longer qualify for the program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-goes-back-on-criminal-amnesty-deal-for-secret-leumi-account-holders/irs-criminal-amnesty/" rel="attachment wp-att-2389"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2389" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="IRS Criminal Amnesty" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IRS-Criminal-Amnesty.jpg" width="256" height="219" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service recently sent out rescission letters notifying tax agencies that, "upon further review," American taxpayers who entered into the IRS criminal amnesty program may be disqualified, according to Forbes. Bank Leumi recently came under U.S. authorities' radar for allegedly helping American account holders <a href="/israeli-banks-target-tax-evasion/">evade federal income taxes</a> and commit other tax law violations. The largest Israeli bank recently announced it would allocate $91 million toward expenses relating to "investigations that are being conducted by the U.S. authorities concerning customers who are U.S. taxpayers."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taxpayers are typically allowed to participate in IRS amnesty programs if they are not currently under audit, investigation or is listed in federal databases as having secret accounts, Forbes explains. However, if any of those circumstances are not met, they may be barred from participating in voluntary disclosure programs and face criminal penalties as well as steep financial fines and punishments. It is not yet clear why the IRS rescinded amnesty for those already enrolled in the program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IRS noted that while it is prohibited from commenting on specific cases, "there are a number of reasons why a taxpayer may be disqualified from participating in the <a href="/us-banks-disclose-foreign-account-info/">IRS's offshore disclosure program</a>. For example, a taxpayer may be disqualified if he/she fails to make a timely, truthful and complete disclosure," the agency said, according to Forbes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IRS practices have been in question as of late, with many analysts arguing that the hard lines the agency is taking with regards to voluntary disclosure programs and its proposal to <a href="/lowering-incentives-whistleblowers/">reduce whistleblower rewards</a> may discourage taxpayers from coming forward with information.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A U.S. District Court acquitted Jimmy Pflueger, an 87-year-old retired auto dealer, of <a href="/auto-mogul-james-pflueger-back-in-court-on-tax-fraud-charges/">four federal tax fraud charges</a>.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/pflueger-cleared-of-tax-fraud-charges/jimmy_pflueger_taxfraud/" rel="attachment wp-att-2396"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2396" alt="Jimmy_Pflueger_taxfraud" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jimmy_Pflueger_taxfraud-300x178.jpg" width="300" height="178" /></a>Pflueger, who founded a string of dealerships, was charged with several tax law violations, including filing false tax returns, hiding roughly $15 million in <a href="/treasury-foreign-bank-account-swiss/">offshore Swiss bank accounts</a>, and failing to pay roughly $27.5 million in taxes for the sale of Hacienda Corporate Plaza in California, according to the Hawaii Reporter. However, Pflueger claimed that his signature was forged on several tax documents and that he was unaware of any fraudulent activity. His accountant, Dennis Duban, pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges, but also implicated the retired auto dealer in his testimony.

While Pflueger escaped criminal prosecution for his alleged tax fraud, the Internal Revenue Service is planning to bring a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">civil lawsuit</a> against him for unpaid back taxes, fees and interest.

Despite the end of the trial, Pflueger is still <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">facing several legal issues</a>, including a $5 million balance he owes to the state of Hawaii in fines for polluting the Pilaa Bay, the news source reports. Further, Pflueger was convicted on 10 felony counts in 2006 for the 1,000-ton mudslide he caused in November 2001 through illegal grading and grubbing, the Hawaii Reporter adds. As a result, he also owes $4 million to victims in a civil settlement.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Puerto Rico is categorized as an unincorporated territory of the United States, and this designation has facilitated its current efforts in appealing to wealthy Americans and corporations.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/puerto-rico-entices-wealthy-americans-with-chance-to-avoid-irs-scrutiny/puerto-rico-wealthy-americans/" rel="attachment wp-att-2403"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2403" alt="Puerto-Rico-Wealthy-Americans" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Puerto-Rico-Wealthy-Americans-300x280.jpg" width="300" height="280" /></a>The small island has launched a campaign encouraging wealthy individuals to relocate to shield future income from the Internal Revenue Service without giving up their passports, according to Bloomberg News. The article notes that Puerto Rico is currently struggling to improve its economy and is attempting to do so by encouraging <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">affluent individuals to invest their money</a> in its economy, which may help it avoid IRS taxes. However, opponents of the campaign said the state is flirting with a dangerous concept, and one that may persuade Americans to potentially violate U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>.

"They're walking a fine line,"  John Buckley, former tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, told Bloomberg. "This would be the first time that Puerto Rico would kind of deliberately erode the U.S. tax base for individuals."

Bloomberg reports that 10 wealthy Americans have already taken advantage of a new Puerto Rican law that enables them to avoid U.S. capital gains taxes if they sign an agreement with the island's government. In order to participate in the agreement, U.S. individuals must pass residency tests - which requires them to spend 183 days in Puerto Rico - and make social and personal connections. Corporations are considering investing more heavily in the territory as well, namely because it is considered foreign territory for tax purposes. This allows companies that conduct operations on the island and make profits to earn and leave money in Puerto Rico without paying U.S. corporate income taxes.

As this trend begins to gain the attention of America's more wealthy residents - such as billionaire John Paulson - Congress has noted that it will be paying closer attention to these developments.]]></content>

The Internal Revenue Service has been cracking down on <a href="/irs-clamps-down-on-businesses-that-misclassify-workers/">businesses that misclassify employees</a> as independent contractors. In an effort to urge employers to come forth with this tax law violation without facing heavy penalties, the federal agency has expanded its <a href="/businesses-face-pressure-to-label-employees-correctly-following-irs-reclassification-program/">Voluntary Worker Classification Settlement Program</a>.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-updates-voluntary-worker-classification-settlement-program/irs-worker-classification/" rel="attachment wp-att-2409"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2409" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px; " alt="irs worker classification" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/irs-worker-classification-270x300.jpg" width="243" height="270" /></a>

The expansion is designed to allow more companies to take advantage of the program by loosening many of its restrictions and qualifying rules. For example, employers currently under an IRS audit, other than an employment tax audit, can now qualify for the VCSP. Additionally, employers accepted into the program will no longer face the mandatory a six-year statute of limitations, compared to the three-year limit that typically applies to payroll taxes, according to Business Finance Magazine.

The IRS is also waiving the requirement mandating that employers file Forms 1099 for the workers they would like to re-classify as employees until June 30, 2013. To date, nearly 1,000 employers have applied for the VCSP, according to Accounting Today.

Under the VCSP, employers who come forward to reclassify contractors as employees may gain relief from their past payroll tax obligations. However, failing to enter the program and being discovered for incorrectly labeling employees can lead to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">heavy tax penalties and lost income</a> while the IRS investigates and reputational damage.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Clients <a href="/americans-involve-more-professionals-in-the-estate-planning-process/">ask tax advisors</a> to compare alternatives by illustrating the net tax effect of the choices available to the client. In order to compute the tax effect, one must assume a certain tax rate to use in the calculation.  There are times, such as now, when the choice of a tax rate is not readily apparent.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/obamacare-the-search-for-a-marginal-tax-rate-and-an-unlikely-opportunity/irs-criminal-amnesty-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2416"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2416" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Tax Rate Opportunity" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IRS-Criminal-Amnesty-300x256.jpg" width="240" height="205" /></a>§1411 imposes a new 3.8% tax on unearned income applicable to individuals, <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estates and trusts</a>. This tax is not imposed on non-resident aliens and charitable trusts exempt from tax. A good deal of effort will be required to understand the definition of unearned income subject to this new tax and to calculate its impact.

The computation requires advisors to calculate Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and Net Investment Income (NII). NII is comprised of (1) passive investment income (dividends, rents, interest, annuities, royalties), (2) income from passive activity or trading financial investments or commodities, and (3) gains from the disposition of property, including assets held by pass-through entities.  The §1411 tax has even caught the sale of a personal residence in its trap.

Taxpayers and advisors will need to revisit the passive loss rules, tabulate hours to satisfy material participation and allocate expenses among activities in order to mitigate the impact of §1411.  There is, however, one more indirect benefit worth your attention.

The United States Treasury has given taxpayers a one-time opportunity to revise its grouping of activities under the passive loss rules in response to the imposition of tax under §1411. Prior to this year, Rev. Proc 2010-13 required the taxpayer to explain to the IRS why the previous grouping was inappropriate, an explanation that taxpayers were hesitant to provide.  Now, taxpayer’s have an opportunity to arrange their groupings in a manner that will minimize the impact of the 3.8% tax and correct any past mistakes.

The opportunity to revise groupings without seeking permission will permit some taxpayers to better utilize losses from active and passive sources.

		<content><![CDATA[<h3>Alleged Illegal Use of Campaign Funds lead to Tax Fraud Violations</h3>
The defense strategy of Cook County Commissioner William Beavers took a hit in a federal Chicago courtroom when an Internal Revenue Services agent testified against him in the ongoing tax fraud trial.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/invalidates-beavers-tax-fraud-defense/cook-county-commissioner-william-beavers/" rel="attachment wp-att-2423"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2423" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Cook County Commissioner William Beavers Tax Fraud" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cook-County-Commissioner-William-Beavers-300x191.jpg" width="300" height="191" /></a>Beavers is currently facing prosecution for tax law violations which allege that he used $225,000 in campaign funds for personal use - including gambling - and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">failed to report the money as income</a> on his taxes. The Commissioner has argued that he took out the funds as a loan and intended to repay the campaign. However, the agent, who testified that Beavers wrote roughly 101 checks to himself from the campaign between 2006 and 2008, said that he was unable to find any evidence that Beavers planned to repay the funds. He also noted that the campaign's bookkeeping still couldn't account for $30,000 claimed by the commissioner.

Evidence shows that Beavers cashed a number of checks - ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 - immediately before playing slots at a number of casinos or on the days that followed his gambling losses.

Beavers pleaded not guilty to four counts of <a href="/pflueger-cleared-of-tax-fraud-charges/">tax fraud</a> and, if convicted, faces three years in prison for each count.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Cook County Commissioner William Beavers was <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">found guilty of tax law violations</a>, being convicted of tax evasion in a federal courtroom in Chicago.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/beaver-convicted-of-tax-evasion/william-beavers-guilty-of-tax-evasion/" rel="attachment wp-att-2432"><img class=" wp-image-2432 aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="William-Beavers-Guilty-of-Tax-Evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/William-Beavers-Guilty-of-Tax-Evasion.jpg" width="432" height="138" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beavers was found guilty of one count of attempting to hide money from the Internal Revenue Service and three counts of filing false tax returns in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Recent testimony from an IRS agent may have been the turning point in the trial, particularly after the agent revealed evidence showing that Beavers had used thousands of dollars in campaign funds to gamble at neighborhood casinos. Evidence revealed him cashing checks ranging from $1,000 to $4,000 in the days prior to and days of visiting casinos.</p>
Despite the ruling, Beavers maintained his innocence, and said he was convicted for failing to wear a wire for federal investigators, according to the Chicago Tribune.

"There's no law against what I did," said Beavers, according to the Tribune. "There's no law against gambling with campaign funds."

Beavers had always asserted that the money he took from campaign coffers was intended to be a loan. However, prosecutors were able to <a href="/invalidates-beavers-tax-fraud-defense/">present evidence that discredited</a> the commissioners claims that he planned to repay the money.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The outcome of a Victoria's Secret lawsuit may have significant tax law implications for companies that use <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">U.S.-based contract manufacturers</a>, according to a new Reuters analysis.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/victorias-secret-lawsuit/victorias-secret-lawsuit/" rel="attachment wp-att-2444"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2444" alt="Victoria's Secret Lawsuit" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Victorias-Secret-Lawsuit-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>L Brands Inc, owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works stores, is currently involved in a tax case surrounding whether $25.4 million in <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax breaks</a> are valid. A 2004 law was designed to help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. by allowing American companies with manufacturing operations to claim a Section 199 tax deduction. L Brands, formerly Limited Brands, employed U.S.-based contract manufacturers produce gels, creams and other items for its stores and gave its contractors specific instructions to follow, Reuters explained.

Despite not owning the contract manufacturing company that produced and labeled its products, L Brands then claimed the <a href="/failing-to-complete-taxes-properly-cost-entrepreneur-18-5-million-in-tax-deductions/">tax deductions</a>, arguing that it "controlled and monitored every stage of the production cycle," the news source reports.

However, the Internal Revenue Service is disputing the deductions taken between 2007 and 2009.

The federal agency theorizes that L Brands did not "communicate frequently with the contract manufacturers" or have any control over the types of raw materials included in the manufacturing process. As a result, it claims the tax breaks are not valid.

The case has not yet began, but analysts say it will have large implications for several U.S. companies.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service released a list of the "Dirty Dozen" tax scams it would be focusing on in this year, and urges consumers and corporations alike to make note of these crimes.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-includes-tax-evasion-and-misuse-of-trusts-in-list-of-dirty-dozen-tax-scams/irs-dirty-dozen-tax-scams/" rel="attachment wp-att-2453"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2453" alt="IRS-Dirty-Dozen-Tax-Scams" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IRS-Dirty-Dozen-Tax-Scams-300x264.jpg" width="240" height="211" /></a>Offshore tax evasion was high on the list of infractions that the IRS is watching out for, and the agency has made significant strides in their ability to detect and prosecute these crimes. The agency has already collected $5.5 billion since 2009 from American owners of foreign accounts who have participated in <a href="/irs-goes-back-on-criminal-amnesty-deal-for-secret-leumi-account-holders/">voluntary disclosure programs</a>, and has also signed a number of agreements with other countries that require them to disclose account information for <a href="/us-banks-disclose-foreign-account-info/">Americans with foreign accounts</a>.

Although the latest round of spending cuts is expected to lower the number of audits the IRS takes on each year, it is likely that the agency will continue to devote significant resources toward fighting offshore tax evasion.

Many business owners and high net-worth individuals also rely upon trust to lower their tax liability and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">transfer wealth to future generations</a>. However, given the large amount of money that is typically deposited in a trust, the IRS also listed misuse of these tax strategies as another area of focus. While a trust can be instrumental in estate planning and transfers of wealth, it's important for individuals to consult a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com">legal or tax professional</a> when setting them up to lower their risk of making costly mistakes or errors.

		<content><![CDATA[New Jersey adopted the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (RULLCA) and it became effective on March 20, 2013 for all new <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/llc/">limited liability companies </a>(LLC) formed after that date.  The law becomes effective on March 14, 2014 for all existing New Jersey LLCs. What may come as a surprise to some is that operating agreements may no longer provide absolute certainty with regard to the remedies available to members in a dispute.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/new-jersey-adopts-a-new-remedy-for-resolving-conflicts-among-members-of-llcs/business-boxer-series/" rel="attachment wp-att-2460"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2460" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="New Jersey Limited Liability Companies" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/New-Jersey-LLC-conflicts-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>One change is the Act provides for dissolution if the managers or members have acted in a manner that is fraudulent or illegal or in a manner that is oppressive or directly harmful to the applicant.  The court may order a sale of the membership interests to the company or any other member.

New Jersey has a corporate statute providing the same remedies to oppressed minority shareholders. One reason for selecting a closely-held New Jersey limited liability company over a <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">closely-held New Jersey corporation</a> had been the absence of these remedies (and the award of attorney fees). Corporate statutes were recently amended to curtail these remedies in order to keep New Jersey from being an outlier.  Some states, such as Delaware, permit the parties to limit the statutory remedies in shareholder, partnership or operating agreements.

Attorneys should advise clients of these changes, especially where existing relationships among members are strained and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">may result in litigation</a>. Nowhere is that more evident than in the family setting where investment real estate or securities produces cash that may be either reinvested or distributed. This decision often creates friction between family members as personal circumstances and lifestyle come into play in making decisions regarding distribution of cash.  Clashes also may arise over the need for reserve funds for capital improvements of real estate or whether to invest for growth or income.]]></content>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="/irs-reports-sequester-may-mean-fewer-audits/">across-the-board spending cuts</a> impacting several federal agencies, a recent $60,000 training product on Tax Evasion the Internal Revenue Service created is now garnering a great deal of criticism that recently forced the agency to apologize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IRS created a "Star Trek" parody training video in 2010 to educate its employers on how to detect tax law violations, including <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">fraud and tax evasion</a>. The agency also created another training video based on "Gilligan's Island." While the video methods themselves did not generate any outrage among lawmakers, the price tag for the skits has landed the agency in hot water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Boustany, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's oversight committee, said that in the middle of a fiscal crisis, he failed to understand how the IRS could spend so much money on these training tools, and demanded that they be released to the public as a testament to the agency's wasteful spending. In response, the IRS instituted new protocols to govern the production of future training materials, and also issued an apology to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The IRS recognizes and takes seriously our obligation to be good stewards of government resources and taxpayer dollars," the agency said in a statement. "There is no mistaking that this video did not reflect the best stewardship of resources."</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied a request made by the Internal Revenue Service to reinstate its tax preparer rules or otherwise known as, tax return preparer regulatory program, pending an appeal.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/court-denies-irs-request-to-reinstate-tax-preparer-rules/irs-denied-tax-preparer-rules/" rel="attachment wp-att-2479"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2479" alt="IRS Denied Tax Preparer Rules" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IRS-Denied-Tax-Preparer-Rules-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a>The ruling said that the federal agency had "not satisfied the stringent requirements" to overturn a lower-court judge's injunction against the IRS's new return preparer regulations, according to Reuters. As a result of the ruling, the IRS's requirements for mandatory testing and continuing education of all tax preparers will continue to be suspended.

The IRS attempted to implement a new tax law that would require <a href="/irs-appeal-tax-licensing-decision/">independent tax preparers</a> to obtain a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN), pass a competency test, pay an annual application fee, and complete 15 hours of continuing education annually.

The law gained considerable support from several tax preparation agencies, which heralded the measure as an additional measure of protection for consumers. In addition, the IRS noted that returns submitted by independent preparers without<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"> proper education and licensing</a> were causing too many costly errors.

However, a lower court struck down the law in February. The IRS has not commented on the appeals decision or announced whether it will appeal the decision.]]></content>

A new report that exposes millions of leaked documents reveals the large extent of tax shelter abuse occurring in the U.S.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/leaked-documents-reveal-tax-shelter-abuse/tax-shelter-abuse/" rel="attachment wp-att-2484"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2484" style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Tax Shelter Abuse" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tax-Shelter-Abuse-300x213.jpg" width="300" height="213" /></a>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reports that 90 journalists from 47 countries have used new technology to examine roughly 2.5 million documents from the last 30 years. Their findings reveal that the large number of people relying on tax shelters to hide income far exceeds previous projections, and include American doctors and dentists, middle-class Greek villagers, a Spanish princess, family members of despots, Wall Street executives and ultra-rich from across the world. The list also includes the names of 4,000 Americans and celebrities.

"We expected to find only the mega rich using [offshore accounts]," said Gerard Ryle, director of the consortium. "But in fact we found it was being used by a much broader section of society."

The report has major implications for several countries around the globe, many of which are now launching probes into their own citizens as a result of the extensive information found. The group that published the report said the findings have significant consequences for the countries impacted by tax shelter abuse, as many have suffered sizable economic losses as a result of these crimes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Groups of <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">business owners</a> and affluent individuals submitted a request to the Internal Revenue Service to make changes to and provide clarifications on one aspect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that may impact their finances: the investment tax.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/businesses-affluent-americans-seek-irs-guidance-on-investment-tax/affluent-americans-investment-tax/" rel="attachment wp-att-2493"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2493" alt="Affluent Americans Investment Tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Affluent-Americans-Investment-Tax-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>A <a href="/obamacare-the-search-for-a-marginal-tax-rate-and-an-unlikely-opportunity/">3.8 percent Medicare surtax on investment income</a>, designed to generate revenue, is considered an overlooked aspect of health care reform. Under the rule, the surtax will be applied to the lesser of net investment income or the amount by which a person's modified adjusted gross income surpasses a $200,000 threshold for single filers or $250,000 for joint filers, Accounting Web reports. The tax begins in 2013 and is projected to raise more than $100 billion during the next 10 years to help fund the health care reform, according to Insurance Journal.

However, many businesses and high net-worth individuals argue that the rules surrounding the tax are confusing, and requested the IRS to provide more clarification on the provision. For example, some critics have said that certain areas of the new rules were still gray, including the treatment of rental income earned by individuals and companies under the new law. Opponents of the law said that the legislation also fails to clarify on how income paid out from trusts would be treated.

Many "pass-through" entities argue that the new <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> provisions are particularly confusing to them, as partnerships, S Corporations and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/llc/">limited liability companies</a> pass profits through to partners and shareholders. As a result of these structures, many told the IRS that they are unsure of whether the new rules apply to them.

The IRS has yet to issue final regulations on the new rule, and have not yet said whether it will take the concerns of business owners and affluent Americans into account before issuing their final word.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-reports-sequester-may-mean-fewer-audits/sequester-tax-audits/" rel="attachment wp-att-2363"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2363" alt="Corporate Tax Audits" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sequester-Tax-Audits-212x300.jpg" width="212" height="300" /></a>Documents obtained by a non-partisan watchdog group, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, revealed that the IRS plans to reduce the number of staffers it places in corporate auditing departments by 18 percent, compared to the number of employees in this department over the last two years. The companies that will face less scrutiny from the tax agency include those with assets of $10 million or more during fiscal year 2013.

IRS spokesman Anthony Burke noted that while the agency will pare back its auditing of large corporations due to fiscal constraints, its audit rate remains high. Burke added that roughly 17 percent of corporations with assets exceeding $10 million face investigations in 2012, according to Reuters.

Some analysts argue that the declining audit rates may facilitate greater tax law violations committed by corporate entities and <a href="/puerto-rico-entices-wealthy-americans-with-chance-to-avoid-irs-scrutiny/">high net-worth individuals</a>.

"The fact that audits are down potentially means less compliance, which is going to produce very difficult choices in the year ahead," said David Burnham, the co-director at TRAC.

According to the report, the IRS will reduce the time it spends auditing the nation's largest corporations by 27 percent, and reduce its audits of individual taxpayers by 7 percent. Smaller entities, such as private equity firms, will also see less attention from the IRS, which plans to reduce the time it spends investigating wrongdoing by 17 percent. Further, the redistribution of staff to other areas and departments does not take into account the effects of the sequester and across the board spending cuts, which will be put in place following the end of<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"> tax filing season</a>.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As the tax deadline nears and individuals rush to submit their returns to the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice is sending a stern warning to those who hold <a href="/?s=Offshore+accounts">offshore accounts</a>: Don't hide your income.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/millionaire-guilty-offshore-tax-evasion/tax-forms-us/" rel="attachment wp-att-2048"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2048" style="margin-right: 5px;" alt="Offshore Tax Evaders" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Offshore-Tax-Evasion-300x200.jpg" width="270" height="180" /></a>Emboldened by the growing success of its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program and the rising number of financial account information-sharing agreements between the IRS and foreign countries, the DOJ said it is confident in its ability to detect and prosecute individual tax evaders who violate U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> by avoiding paying for taxes on income.

Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ's Tax Division, noted that 38,000 taxpayers have emerged with information about the operation of offshore accounts, and that the DOJ and IRS are using the information ascertained to extend their investigations. She noted that offshore account holders who are waiting to determine if the DOJ will catch on are playing with fire, according to policy website Main Justice.

"If there's one message I want to get out there on the offshore bank accounts issue, it is that time is running out, and anyone who is still waiting should come forward," Keneally said.

Under the current terms of the voluntary program, once an investigation into an individual has begun, they are no longer eligible for protection and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by the National Taxpayer Advocate sheds light on five metropolitan areas in which the likelihood for tax evasion - and audits for potential tax evaders - is the highest.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-data-shows-clusters-of-potential-tax-evaders-in-five-cities/tax_evaders_irs_audit/" rel="attachment wp-att-2519"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2519" alt="tax_evaders_IRS_audit" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tax_evaders_IRS_audit-300x222.jpg" width="300" height="222" /></a>

The Associated Press provided an exclusive report on the study's findings, which reveal that small business owners and individuals living in wealthy areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Atlanta or the District of Columbia, are the most likely to undergo an audit for possible <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> violations. The confidential data is used by the IRS to make determinations about which entities and individuals to target for audits, the AP reports.

Many of the specific neighborhoods targeted, such as Beverly Hills and Newport Beach, California, are likely targeted due to the high incomes of their residents, which increases the potential risk of an audit. Further, many residents of these areas are small business owners, which tend to be areas of interest for the IRS because many small entities deal in cash and have greater<a href="/puerto-rico-entices-wealthy-americans-with-chance-to-avoid-irs-scrutiny/"> opportunities to alter their taxes</a> than individuals, the news source said.

A separate IRS report indicates that <a href="/irs-reports-sequester-may-mean-fewer-audits/">budget constraints may lead to fewer audits</a> in 2013, particularly for <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/" target="_blank">large corporate entities</a>. However, smaller companies and high net-worth individuals may continue to see a consistent stream of auditing as the IRS attempts to close the federal tax gap.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Lawmakers' decision to allow for a $5.25 million exemption for estates may have served as a<a href="http://businessowneraudiobooks.com/audio-books/rich-dad-poor-dad-takeaways/"> great relief to wealthy individuals</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">small business owners</a> who want to pass on considerable wealth to future generations. However, during <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax planning</a>, it's important for individuals to also take estate taxes that their particular state may impose to gain a more accurate picture of their liability.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/business-owners-and-wealthy-individuals-account-for-state-estate-taxes/state-estate-taxes/" rel="attachment wp-att-2527"><img class="alignright wp-image-2527" style="margin-left: 5px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/State-Estate-Taxes-300x300.jpg" alt="State Estate Taxes" width="240" height="240" /></a>Kiplinger notes that 21 states and the District of Columbia currently impose some type of estate tax, most of which have significantly lower thresholds than federal guidelines. This includes New Jersey - which imposes a tax on estates worth more than $675,000 - and New York, which taxes estates valued at $1 million or more. The top rates in these highly-populated states currently sit at 16 percent, Kiplinger reports.

In addition to <a href="/estate-tax-changes-in-2013-spark-more-concise-business-succession-planning/">estate taxes</a>, some states also impose an inheritance tax, which can further cut into the wealth an individual can pass on.

Forbes reports many people with considerable assets are relying more heavily on bypass trusts, which are typically set up after the death of a first spouse. In other instances, more individuals are relying on <a href="/many-business-owners-failing-to-take-advantage-of-tax-free-gifting-before-it-expires/">tax-free gifts</a> to help lower their liability. Under the current rules, individuals can gift up to $14,000 tax free to any number of individuals.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/">State law</a> does matter in the selection of a jurisdiction in which to create a domestic asset protection trust (APT). A brief (and incomplete) history of APTs may help the reader understand why.<a href="asset-protection-state-law-does-matter" rel="attachment wp-att-2537"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2537" alt="Asset_Protection_State_Law" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Asset_Protection_State_Law1-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a>

Common law prevented an individual from establishing a trust to protect one’s assets from the claims of creditors where he or she is a beneficiary. Large jury verdicts and the escalating cost of insurance prompted advisers to look for a solution. Off-shore asset protection jurisdictions responded by amending their laws to permit APTs to protect one’s assets from creditors.  In response to the loss of trust and<a href="/businesses-affluent-americans-seek-irs-guidance-on-investment-tax/"> investment business</a>, more than ten states have abolished the common law rule and permit a domestic APT to protect one’s assets from claims of creditors.   The factors listed below should be evaluated before selecting a jurisdiction for an APT.

First, state law should permit property to remain in trust in perpetuity in order to maintain the protection. Second, the trust should not be subject to state income tax in more than one state. Poor planning can cause a trust and beneficiaries to be subject to income tax in more than one state. There are several factors that may cause state income taxation of a trust. The law of the state of residence of the grantor, each trustee and each beneficiary must be analyzed. The analysis must also consider the place where trust assets are held and administered.

Third, law on fraudulent conveyances should be analyzed in order to determine the degree of protection against the claims of creditors.  Some states have special creditors, such as spouses and children, who may pierce the trust to collect on their claims. One should also analyze the state statute for protection against the claims of future creditors and the length of time before claims are barred.  Many foreign jurisdictions measure time from the date of transfer of assets to the APT rather than the date of the claim is discovered. Using the date of transfer provides greater certainty and protection.

Fourth, the decanting statute should be examined because it is conceivable that a trust may no longer function for its intended purpose. Decanting of the trust may permit its amendment or transfer to another jurisdiction.

Fifth, local law may authorize creation of a Directed Trust whereby trustee administration is separated from investment decisions. This allows the investments to be handled by an <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com">investment adviser</a> or the business to be run by a manager without making the administrative trustee liable for their decisions. Sixth, consider the application of the Delaware tax trap to powers of appointment exercised under state law.

The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution requires that a judgment obtained in one state be enforced by the courts of another state. Enforcement of a foreign judgment against an APT in an asset protection state is a question yet to be decided.  Most off-shore jurisdictions will not enforce a judgment obtained outside its borders.

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is receiving a great deal of criticism after allegations that it relies on <a href="/dont-overlook-digital-records-during-estate-planning/">social media</a> and emails as an investigative tool into potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a> being committed by Americans.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?p=2553&amp;preview=true" rel="attachment wp-att-2563"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2563" alt="IRS_Social_Media_Taxpayer_Information" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IRS_Social_Media_Taxpayer_Information-205x300.jpg" width="205" height="300" /></a>

For example, if a person submits a suspicious tax return in which they claim little income, but then post pictures of a luxury purchase or string of vacations they took, this could prompt greater scrutiny by the IRS, Digital Trends reports.

The charge has led to a great deal of scrutiny about which means the federal agencies can and cannot use to prosecute potential lawbreakers. When it comes to <a href="/facebook-irs-tax-law/">social media </a>sites, such as Facebook and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/s_h_law">Twitter</a>, the law may be on the side of the IRS if it relies on public information to support its claims, according to the news source. Information that is made publicly might be fair game for federal agents, and many professionals across different industries - ranging from divorce attorneys to insurance agents - have used information publicly posted on Facebook and Twitter in a legal atmosphere.

However, the IRS has denied using social media in any form to go after Americans.

"Suggestions that the IRS is using social media to target taxpayers for audit are wrong," an IRS spokesperson told Fox Business. "Audits are based on the information contained on a person's tax return, not a posting on a social media site."

However, the IRS recently got into hot water for its controversial policy of reading taxpayers' personal emails without a search warrant. In a U.S. Senate hearing, Acting Commissioner Steven Miller said that the no-warrant-required policy would be eliminated within 30 days for e-mail communications, according to CNET. However, he did not elaborate on whether other types of private communications would also fall under this suspended policy.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A growing number of companies across a variety of industries are changing their business designations in an effort to lower their liability under federal tax law.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?p=2573&amp;preview=true" rel="attachment wp-att-2580"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2580" alt="Change_Business_Designation_for_Tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Change_Business_Designation_for_Tax-300x116.jpg" width="300" height="116" /></a>

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/business/restyled-as-real-estate-trusts-varied-businesses-avoid-taxes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> exclusively reported on this increasingly common scenario, in which corporations that operate in several sectors - including prisons, casinos and infrastructure - are classifying themselves as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to reduce or eliminate their tax bills. The trust was traditionally associated with funds the solely hold real estate, but in recent years, the Internal Revenue Service has been <a href="/reit-investments-tax-rules/">expanding the definition of what qualifies as real estate</a>. General REIT qualifying rules require that they do no business, and only own real estate. However, the IRS is increasingly allowing more companies to divide up aspects of their businesses that don't correspond with real estate. As a result, more corporations are gaining permission from the tax agency to convert to REITs.

Most recently, Corrections Corp. of America, which owns and operates 44 prisons and detention centers, and Penn National Gaming, which operates 22 casinos, were granted permission from the IRS to change their designation under tax law, the Times reports. Many analysts say this trend will only intensify in the coming years as corporations seek out strategies to avoid paying high taxes.

"I've been in this business for 30 years, and I've never seen the interest in <a href="/irs-loosens-reit-tax-rules/">REIT conversions</a> as high as it is today," Robert O'Brien, head of the real estate practice at Deloitte &amp; Touche, told the Times.

An analyst at Wall Street firm Jeffries also commented on the scenario, saying it's "not a far stretch to envision REITs concentrated in railroads, highways, mines, landfills, vineyards, farmland or any other 'immovable' structure that generates revenues," according to the news source.

While some analysts may feel that the heavier use of REITs to lower tax liability may allow corporations to skirt their tax responsibilities, there appear to be few obstacles that may slow the growth of this strategy.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A U.S. Magistrate Judge has postponed sentencing for Grammy winner <a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">Lauryn Hill after she pleaded guilty</a> to tax law violations, but she still must pay back taxes by May 3.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/lauryn-hills-deadline-to-pay-back-taxes-nears/lauryn-hill-tax-problems/" rel="attachment wp-att-2590"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2590 alignright" alt="Lauryn Hill Tax Problems" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lauryn-Hill-Tax-Problems-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>In 2012, Hill admitted to failing to file tax returns from 2005 to 2007 on $1.8 million in income earned during that period. Although the court granted the New Jersey resident a two-week reprieve to come up with the rest of the money she owes, she was required to pay more than $504,000 to the federal government by the May 3 deadline. She has already made one $50,000 toward her <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">taxes and penalties</a>, according to Reuters.

Hill, who has not released an album in 12 years, hoped to generate some income to put toward her back taxes by <a href="http://www.sportsentertainmentattorney.com/">signing a new recording contract</a>, but these plans were stalled, the news source added. Instead, Hill's representative said she planned to take out a loan to make her payment and was simply waiting on final approval. U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo scheduled the final hearing for May 6, and cautioned Hill to avoid making any requests or missteps.

"This is not someone who stands before the court penniless," Arleo said, according to Reuters.

Hill currently faces up to three years in prison, one year for each count of tax evasion. A MarketWatch analysis notes that courts were sending more tax cheats to jail in an effort to curb the high incidence of tax evasion and prompt evaders to pay their back taxes. Citing data from the Internal Revenue Service, the news source reports that in 2012, 673 tax evaders received jail sentences, a 52 percent increase from 2002 when 442 served prison time for their tax crimes. This trend may also come to affect <a href="/doj-sends-word-of-caution-to-tax-evaders/">wealthy tax evaders</a> more heavily as the IRS seeks to close the tax gap. Audits of those making $1 million or more increased 12 percent in 2012 from those conducted in 2011, MarketWatch reports.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Are Bitcoins Taxable? Bitcoins are becoming more visible and popular among consumers, and many investors are even focusing on the prospects that this digital currency may yield. As the demand for Bitcoins - which are used in a <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/cyber-security-data-protection/">digital environment</a> as real cash - increases significantly, the Internal Revenue Service may set its sights on the currency as taxable income.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/are-bitcoins-taxable-uncertainty-persists/" rel="attachment wp-att-2596"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2596" alt="Are-bitcoins-taxable" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Are-bitcoins-taxable-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>A recent article in Business Insider noted that the value of Bitcoins have nearly tripled since March alone, and are currently valued at $115. Some analysts predict that as the value of Bitcoins continue to increase and demand grows, new potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> guidelines may come into play, the news source theorized.

Some have argued that the U.S. may not focus too heavily on taxing the currency because they are not recognized as legal currency, save for the online world, and they receive financial backing from governments around the globe, Business Insider added. As a result of these stipulations, many who are opposed to taxing them argue that if the currency is not recognized, it should not fall under tax rules.

However, many users are finding ways to add real value to the Bitcoins, which may result in taxation down the road. For example, some users can visit online currency exchange websites and sell Bitcoins for real currency, including USD, the article noted. As a result, this may be considered income under federal law, and therefore taxable.

"As soon as you go to exchange them for dollars, you definitely have a tax obligation on that," David Stewart, an international tax reporter for Tax Analyst, told the news source. "There is value in Bitcoins, whether or not people outside the Bitcoin community believe it."

When it comes to businesses that accept Bitcoins, IRS spokesperson Anthony Burke told the Huffington Post that the agency is trying to classify whether payments should be considered payments in foreign currency, barter or in-kind payments, as these may each fall under different tax guidelines.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Grammy-winner Lauryn Hill will be required to serve a prison sentence for tax evasion, a court ruled this week.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/lauryn-hill-receives-prison-sentence-for-tax-evasion/lauryn-hill-jail-time/" rel="attachment wp-att-2604"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2604" style="margin-top: 10px; " alt="Lauryn Hill Jail Time" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lauryn-Hill-Jail-Time-1024x682.jpg" width="430" height="286" /></a>In a federal court in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo sentenced Hill to three months in prison for her <a href="/lauryn-hills-deadline-to-pay-back-taxes-nears/">failure to pay income taxes</a> on more than $1.8 million in earnings between 2005 and 2007.

<a href="/lauryn-hill-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion/">Hill pleaded guilty</a> to the charges last year and has since repaid $970,000 of the amount she owed. However, she still owes both <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal taxes and liabilities</a> to the state of New Jersey. Judge Arleo also sentenced Hill to an additional three months of house arrest after her release, as well as nine months of supervision after leaving prison. The 37-year-old artist will also be required to pay a $60,000 fine.

The singer was originally planning to repay a larger amount, but said she was unable to come up with the funding due to her inactivity in the <a href="http://www.sportsentertainmentattorney.com/">music business</a>. In April, the Orange County resident announced a deal to produce a new album with Sony Worldwide Entertainment.

"I have been working towards this for a long time, not just because of my current legal situation, but because I am an artist, I love to create, and I need the proper platform to do so," Hill wrote on Tumblr when she announced the agreement.

She faced up to one year in prison on each of the three counts, but her representative strongly lobbied for probation given her cooperation with the court. During the hearing, Hill compared her situation to slavery when she addressed Judge Arleo.

"I was put into a system I didn't know the nature of ... I'm a child of former slaves," Hill said, according to the Los Angeles Times. "I got into an economic paradigm and had that imposed on me. I sold 50 million units ... now I'm up here paying a tax debt. If that's not likened to slavery, I don't know what is."

Hill's sentence will begin on July 8, though it still unclear where she will serve her time.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has relied heavily on its <a href="/voluntary-disclosure-program-enabled-irs-to-collect-5-billion-from-offshore-tax-evaders/">Voluntary Offshore Disclosure Program</a> to find tax law violators and recoup billions in hidden or unreported <a href="/doj-sends-word-of-caution-to-tax-evaders/">offshore tax funds</a>, penalties and interest. However, a new government report reveals that the number of individuals reporting hidden income is on the rise, but some may be relying on another reporting method instead of the voluntary disclosure program.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/americans-report-hidden-income-under-quiet-disclosure-agreements/" rel="attachment wp-att-2613"><img class="wp-image-2613 aligncenter" style="margin-top: 5px;" alt="Quiet Disclosure Agreements" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Quiet-Disclosure-Agreements.jpg" width="322" height="377" /></a>The Government Accountability Office released new data indicating that thousands are likely relying on quiet disclosure agreements to report hidden income from foreign accounts without paying interest and penalties. Quiet disclosure agreements refer to a technique in which taxpayers attempt to avoid penalties by filing amended returns that report offshore income from previous years. As hidden income from foreign and offshore accounts can amount to billions of dollars, analysts note that quiet disclosure techniques - and the loss of interest and penalties - may lead to lost opportunities for the IRS to make progress in closing the tax gap.</p>
The report found that the number of people reporting foreign accounts to the IRS almost doubled to 516,000 accounts from 2007 to 2010. The GAO noted that the sharp rise in people reporting account information suggests that fewer people are <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">taking part in voluntary programs</a> and simply reporting their income quietly.

"IRS has detected some taxpayers with previously undisclosed offshore accounts attempting to circumvent paying the taxes, interest and penalties that would otherwise be owed," the report said. "But based on GAO reviews of IRS data, IRS may be missing attempts by other taxpayers attempting to do so."

The GAO noted that only 39,000 people applied for the IRS amnesty program, meaning that thousands more are likely relying on quiet disclosures. While the IRS is not required to accept GAO recommendations for how to manage tax collection efforts, the agency is encouraging the IRS to analyze first-time offshore account reporting trends and implement new detection strategies to better identify those using the quiet disclosure method.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Senate passed The Marketplace Fairness Act (the “Act”) and sent the bill for consideration to the House.  The Act provides that internet retailers must collect sales <a href="/?s=out+of+state">tax on out-of-state transactions</a> reversing the holdings of cases and interpretations of statutes that protected out-of-state sellers for decades.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/the-marketplace-fairness-act-does-it-foreshadow-a-value-added-tax/" rel="attachment wp-att-2622"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2622" style="margin-top: 5px;" alt="MarketPlace_Fairness_Act" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MarketPlace_Fairness_Act-300x247.jpg" width="300" height="247" /></a>

There is a long history of case law that prevented out-of-state businesses from being <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">subject to taxation</a> or collecting taxes unless the business had “sufficient contacts” with the state to justify this jurisdiction.  Prior to the internet, jurisdictional issues arose out of travelling salesmen, title passage rules and drop shipments.   More sophisticated questions arose out of intercompany fees for licensing intangibles, leased employees and order fulfillment centers. States, however, could not exert jurisdiction over a non-resident seller who took orders over the internet.  Instead, states relied on their citizens to pay use tax on out-of-state purchases.

In order for a state to obtain the privileges of the Act, the state must either adopt the Streamlined  Sales and Use Tax Agreement or adhere to a more simplified sales tax measure. The key measure in either case is that the location of the buyer determines the sales tax rate and state to which it is paid.  This will create a more level playing field between brick and mortar retailers and internet retailers.  It will certainly help states to collect revenue.

If this precedent is overcome, it will not be long before a <a href="/?s=VAT">VAT</a> could be imposed. European countries impose a VAT on sales of goods and services. The proponents of a VAT cite the sophistication of software to do the reporting and tax calculation.  I predict that we will do the same to capture more transactions in the tax net.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A federal court in San Francisco has authorized the Internal Revenue Service to issue a John Doe summons to Wells Fargo for information on Americans with Foreign accounts at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce FirstCaribbean International Bank (FCIB).<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-summons-wells-fargo-to-release-information-on-americans-with-foreign-accounts/" rel="attachment wp-att-2632"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2632" alt="Americans_With_Foreign_Accounts" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Americans_With_Foreign_Accounts-300x254.jpg" width="257" height="217" /></a>

The FCIB is based in Barbados, has 18 branches in the Caribbean, according to Forbes. However, the institution holds a <a href="/?s=offshore+accounts">correspondent account</a> through Wells Fargo, giving the IRS authority to monitor transactions, particularly in cases of potential wrongdoing. Senior District Judge Thelton Henderson signed the order, which will allow the IRS to identify U.S. taxpayers with accounts at the FCIB that were held from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012. A John Doe summons is generally used by the IRS to obtain information about possible federal tax law violations by individuals whose identities are unknown, according to AccountingToday.

The IRS has claimed that an undisclosed number of U.S. taxpayers who hold accounts with FCIB are using the <a href="/doj-sends-word-of-caution-to-tax-evaders/">accounts to hide income</a> and avoid compliance with U.S. tax laws, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/04/30/u-s-demands-wells-fargo-records-to-identify-u-s-tax-cheats-using-caribbean-havens/">Forbes reports</a>. However, more than 120 account holders have already come forward and enrolled in the voluntary disclosure program to avoid prosecution.

"This John Doe summons is a visible indication of how we are using the many tools available to us to pursue this activity wherever it is occurring," said Kathryn Keneally, assistant attorney general for the tax division of the Justice Department, AccountingToday reports. "Those who are still hiding should get right with their country and their fellow taxpayers before it is too late."

The IRS has made sweeping efforts in recent years to detect Americans who evade taxes through the use of offshore accounts. While budget cuts may lower the number of audits for middle-income U.S. taxpayers, it is unlikely to affect efforts to curb tax law violations committed by wealthy Americans and corporate entities.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax law for American expatriates continues to be a hot topic of debate. While financial experts think that employees in this position may be getting the best of the tax system, many Americans living abroad say it's actually punishing them.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/harsh-tax-law-for-american-expatriates/" rel="attachment wp-att-2527"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2527" alt="State Estate Taxes" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/State-Estate-Taxes-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>This is a particularly large issue for American executives who spend a major portion of their careers in different countries, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/29/americans-abroad-seek-tax-law-changes/fiduvux1S5a8i56WiAQCwM/story.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg News reports</a>. According to these individuals, filings their taxes involves fillings out more than 100 pages of documents, such as those for <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">foreign pension and tax credits</a>.

"It can be extremely complicated," Charles Allard, a financial services executive living in Hong Kong, told the newspaper. "This will become more of an issue as the world becomes more global and more <a href="/national-taxpayer-advocate-ovdp/" target="_blank">Americans want to live and work overseas</a>."

The United States is currently the only county in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that taxes its citizens no matter where they work. This accounts for nearly 7 million expatriates.

Even members of the<a href="/?s=IRS"> Internal Revenue Service</a> agree that the the current tax codes faced by Americans working abroad are overly strict and create unnecessary burden, according to the news source.

In an effort to change the ways in which American expatriates file their taxes, Allard and roughly 100 other executives nationwide are urging the House Ways and Means Committee to change their tax requirements. However, as tension continues to build between lawmakers and those pushing for more tax codes and requirements, Allard may be fighting an uphill battle.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service was not wholly unaffected by budget cuts and the federal sequester, and saw many of its financial resources diminished as a result. In response, the IRS may lean on technology solutions to detect tax law violations and penalize criminals. However, the agency's use of new data mining innovations has raised a number of privacy concerns and inquiries among consumers, legal professionals and tax preparers. <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-robo-audits-raise-privacy-concerns/" rel="attachment wp-att-2645"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2645" alt="IRS_Robo_Audits_Raise_Privacy_Concerns" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IRS_Robo_Audits_Raise_Privacy_Concerns-213x300.jpg" width="213" height="300" /></a>

According to U.S. News and World Report, the IRS is relying more heavily on robo-audits and data mining to match returns and detect <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">potential cases of tax evasion</a>, fraud and inconsistencies. While the technology has been used in the past to <a href="/irs-to-cut-back-on-individual-corporate-audits-in-2013/">catch low- to middle-income Americans who commit tax violations</a>, the agency is expected to make technological advancements that allow it to focus on small businesses owners. For example, the technology now allows the IRS to track credit card transactions and gather other information from online transactions and <a href="/irs-may-lean-on-social-media-to-gain-information-about-taxpayers/">social media postings</a>.

At the heart of the issue is which types of third-party data the IRS will use and how this information will be assessed when trying to detect and prosecute tax evaders, the news source reports. Currently, the agency has only said that the systems allow it to gather data on every single taxpayer, including shopping records, travel, social communications and non-public information, such as health records, according to U.S. News and World Report.

"This capability is designed to feed into a single, consolidated taxpayer-account database that will support the deployment of the next generation of taxpayer service and enforcement functions," said U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George, the news source reports.

While many tax law attorneys and preparers have requested more guidance on this topic from the IRS, the agency noted that these disclosures may hinder its detection efforts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[One of the many controversies in Washington, D.C. is the dispute arising out of the Internal Revenue Service’s extensive review of  applications of exempt organizations using the names with words such as “Tea Party,”  “Patriots” and “We The People.”  I spent some time explaining to a client how the review process between the IRS and the Tea Party organizations are conducted.  More importantly, I explained why the review is important.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-and-the-tea-party" rel="attachment wp-att-2658"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2658" alt="IRS_and_the_Tea_Party" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IRS_and_the_Tea_Party-300x261.jpg" width="245" height="220" /></a>

<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">An organization is taxable</a> for federal income tax purposes unless it qualifies under a particular subsection of section (“§”) 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The organization submits an <i>Application For Recognition of Exemption Under Section</i> <i>501( c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code </i>on Form 1023.  Organizations that serve<a href="/the-absence-of-symmetry-part-1-of-2/"> charitable and educational purposes</a> are eligible for exempt status.  Political organizations are treated differently and are governed by different rules.  The operative word in this analysis is “educational” because educating the public on an issue could also be construed as being political or attempting to influence voters and elections.

The regulations in this area provide guidance to what is acceptable as “educational.” It states:
<blockquote><i>An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or viewpoint so long as it presents a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts in order to permit individuals or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion.</i></blockquote>
When is an organization educational under §501 (c)(3) and what are there limits on what an organization may advocate on issues involving public policy?  I posed this question to a client who became uneasy with the prospect of charities acting as political organizations and influencing elections.  This is the issue that appears lost in D.C. political theater.

There are controversial public policy issues such as gay and lesbian rights, prayer in schools, contraception and <a href="/doomsday-prophet-found-guilty-of-tax-evasion/">church</a> medical plans.  There are no shortage of cases where religious organizations clashed with the government lost tax exempt status.   Bob Jones University,  Synanon Church and the <i>Church</i><i> of Scientology</i><i> </i>are among the most notable.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The tax administrations of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have teamed up to detect and prosecute those hiding income in offshore accounts, the Internal Revenue Service recently announced.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts" rel="attachment wp-att-2667"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2667" alt="Offshore_Accounts" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Offshore_Accounts-296x300.jpg" width="243" height="247" /></a>

The IRS noted that it found "a substantial amount of data" on offshore accounts held in the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, and Singapore, and the three counties are teaming up to investigate those <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">committing tax law violations</a> through these accounts. The countries noted that the information gathered reveals the identities of the individual owners of these entities, as well as the advisors who assisted in establishing the entity structure.

"This is part of a wider effort by the IRS and other tax administrations to pursue <a href="/irs-includes-tax-evasion-and-misuse-of-trusts-in-list-of-dirty-dozen-tax-scams/">international tax evasion</a>," said IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. "Our cooperative work with the United Kingdom and Australia reflects a bigger goal of leaving no safe haven for people trying to illegally evade taxes."

The IRS also noted that the three-country coordination may also help other countries who request the <a href="/americans-report-hidden-income-under-quiet-disclosure-agreements/">offshore tax data</a> seek out their own citizens who may evading the law. In an interview with Bloomberg, Michael Danilack, an IRS deputy commissioner for international issues, said Canada has already requested information.

Several reports have come to light as of late that hints at or blatantly reveals the identities of those in the U.S. and abroad who may have skirted their tax responsibilities through the use of offshore accounts.

The New York Times recently reported the contents of a leaked document obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which revealed the names of thousands of Americans, Europeans, and foreigners who hold offshore accounts. The report details the specific account details of these offshore havens, which may give the IRS more ammunition to launch investigations against potential tax evaders.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Billionaire Sumner Redstone may be on the hook for a large sum of money relating to a tax gift he made to his children in 1972 if the Internal Revenue Service has its way.

The federal agency claims Redstone owes $1.1 million in taxes, penalties, and interest relating to stock given to his children 41 years ago, according to Bloomberg News. However, the CBS and Viacom chairman argues that the stock should not be considered a gift under federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>, but instead as an "ordinary business transaction."

The dispute revolves around a family lawsuit that occurred in the 1970s. While Sumner was employed at his family's business, his brother Edward left the family-owned company and threatened to sell off shares of the business outside of the family.

The family was able to reach a settlement with him, though, under which Edward's shares were instead directed to his children as well as Sumner's son and daughter, Bloomberg explains. However, the fact that Sumner Redstone failed to file a tax return for the year in question has complicated the matter, as there is no statute of limitations on taking action against individuals in years when no return was filed, the news source adds.

In a petition filed with the U.S. Tax Court, Redstone noted that in the past 41 years, the IRS has never claimed that he extended taxable gifts in 1972.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Thousands of business owners run operations directly out of their residence each year, and many reduce their tax liabilities to the Internal Revenue Service by claiming a home office deduction.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/aicpa-urges-irs-to-change-home-office-deduction-safe-harbor-provision" rel="attachment wp-att-2686"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2686 alignright" style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px;" alt="Home_Office_Deduction" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Home_Office_Deduction-300x100.jpg" width="384" height="128" /></a>

While the write-off is perfectly legal and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">valid under federal tax law</a>, home office deductions are also one of the most heavily scrutinized by IRS agents because there is a great deal of wiggle room to inflate expenses. As business owners can deduct equipment, rent, insurance premiums, and other related expenses, the IRS examines these returns closely for evidence of dishonesty.

In order to make the deductions less complex and easier to calculate, the agency recently proposed a new safe harbor method that would simplify the way business owners claim the deduction. Under the method, owners could deduct expenses at $5 per square foot for a maximum of 300 square feet of qualified home office space used. The maximum <a href="/?s=deduction">yearly deduction</a> would be set at $1,500.

However, the American Institute of CPAs recently sent a letter to the IRS urging it to reconsider some of the safe harbor method proposals. In a letter to the agency, AICPA Tax Executive Committee chairman Jeffrey Porter asked the IRS to consider increasing the maximum deduction to between $2,000 and $3,000, according to Accounting Today.

The Institute also encourages the IRS to establish a <a href="/?s=cost+of+living">cost-of-living adjustment</a> to take inflation into account.

"We recommend that the IRS and Treasury re-evaluate and alter some of the details of their proposal to implement the safe harbor method," Porter wrote, according to the news source. "For taxpayers who have been claiming (or may in the future claim) the home office deduction under the actual expense method, unanticipated administrative burdens have been created for the taxpayer, which should be considered when the IRS and Treasury draft future guidance and forms for both the safe harbor and actual methods of home office deductions."

The IRS has not yet responded to these proposals.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Apple executive Tim Cook was called to testify before Congress on May 21, 2013 regarding its use of <a href="/treasury-reaches-final-agreement-with-ireland-on-anti-tax-evasion/">Irish subsidiaries</a> and the tax savings that resulted.   My initial thought was that, in his opening statement, Mr. Cook should have quoted the distinguished jurist; however, I suspect Apple’s <a href="/?s=public+relations">public relations</a> department would have advised him otherwise.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/apple-tim-cook-and-judge-learned-hand" rel="attachment wp-att-2707"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2707" alt="Tim_Cook" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tim_Cook-243x300.jpg" width="205" height="254" /></a>

What is missing from the coverage of his testimony is the reality of business.  Apple competes against foreign corporations that engage in similar types of planning. Mr. Cook has a duty to Apple shareholders to maximize <i>shareholder value</i> which requires <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">minimizing taxes</a>.  What is missing from the coverage is that not every country taxes its corporations on a worldwide basis. Some countries tax corporations only if they are managed and controlled in that particular jurisdiction. If Congress wants to change this result, then it must add a few more provisions to the Internal Revenue Code.

If we are the land of the free, perhaps we should remind ourselves of Justice Hand’s words:

		<content><![CDATA[Julio Robaina, former mayor of Hialeah, Florida mayor, and his wife, Raiza Villacis Robaina, were recently charged with tax evasion in a Miami federal court, and are expected to turn themselves into the authorities to <a href="/doj-sends-word-of-caution-to-tax-evaders/">await further proceedings</a>.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/former-florida-mayor-and-wife-charged-with-tax-evasion" rel="attachment wp-att-2714"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2714" style="margin-top: 5px" alt="tax_evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tax_evasion-300x272.jpg" width="247" height="224" /></a>

The couple was charged with fraud, conspiracy, lying to federal agents, and falsifying documents. Additionally, they were accused of receiving unreported interest payments in cash on more than $1 million in personal loans they made to friends and business associates, according to CBS Miami. One of these associates included Ponzi scheme con artist Luis Felipe Perez, whose investigation and subsequent conviction prompted investigators to look into the financial dealings of the Robainas.

During the 2011 investigation, Robaina repeatedly asserted his innocence and declared he was not under investigation because he had received no formal notice. Robaina argued that he was a victim of Perez, who<a href="/?s=con+artist"> conned individuals</a> into investing in non-existent pawn shops and jewelry stores in New York and Miami, CBS Miami reported.

"We were investing in his business, which he bought and sold precious gems, or at least that's what he represented to us," Robaina told the news station. "We were victims of a friend who took advantage of us, but we are not under investigation."

After examining bank and financial statements, authorities discovered the discrepancies relating to unreported interest payments. Under federal tax law, individuals are responsible for reporting any interest payments on loan, which may be considered taxable income.

"The tax system is built on the premise that taxpayers file accurate tax returns," said Michael DePalma, the head IRS investigator in Miami, according to The Associated Press. "No one is above the law and those who willfully <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">violate our nation's tax laws</a> will be held accountable for their actions."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The ramifications of the sequester may have an impact on the Internal Revenue Service's ability to effectively audit potential tax law violators. In response, the agency is shoring up its 2014 budget to avoid auditing and compliance disruptions.<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance" rel="attachment wp-att-2722"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2722" alt="tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tax-300x290.jpg" width="238" height="230" /></a>

According to Fox Business, the IRS will decrease its customer service departments and operations by 1 percent and instead redistribute its funds to manage the high incidence of tax evasion and tax avoidance carried out by individuals, offshore account holders, and businesses.

Data from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reveals that the IRS requested a budget of $12.9 billion in 2014, a $1 billion increase from its operating budget in 2012. The request reveals that breakdown of the additional $1 billion, with the majority of the funding going toward increasing full-time staff to 4,572 full-time workers. The agency also plans to increase its enforcement by 6.93 percent and its operations support by 13.51 percent.

Fox Business reports that the IRS' budget increases, if approved, will largely be used in an attempt to close the federal tax gap, which ballooned to $450 billion in 2006, from $345 billion in 2001.

Despite the potential budget increase, the agency noted recently that the furloughs and sequestration ramifications may force it to tone down audits of corporations and focus its attention on less costly investigations of high net-worth individuals and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">small business owners</a>.

To help make up for the budgetary shortfalls, the agency has expanded a number of voluntary programs - including its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program and its Voluntary <a href="/irs-updates-voluntary-worker-classification-settlement-program/">Classification Settlement Program</a> relating to misclassified workers - to encourage more lawbreakers to come forward before an investigation is launched.

In addition, the IRS is working with several foreign countries to share account information of <a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">American offshore account holders</a> in an effort to detect hidden income or misrepresented earnings.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many small businesses seeking to improve efficiency and ensure compliance with U.S. tax law outsource their payroll services to third-party providers. These companies typically <a href="/struggling-to-meet-business-costs-dont-neglect-payroll-taxes/">manage online payroll</a> processing for workers and employee payroll <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax filing</a>, giving business owners more freedom to focus on their operations. However, payroll tax fraud is an increasingly common tax law violation, and when this occurs, small businesses run the risk of facing fines, penalties, and reputational damage.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/lawmakers-encourage-irs-to-focus-attention-on-payroll-services-fraud" rel="attachment wp-att-2380"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2380" alt="Payroll_Services" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/irs-business-owners-270x300.jpg" width="212" height="237" /></a>In response, lawmakers are pushing the Internal Revenue Service to conduct a larger <a href="/irs-new-regulations-payroll-providers/">crackdown on these service providers</a> to protect local employers.

Talks between lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee, IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller, and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George addressed the need to recognize the warning signs of payroll provider fraud. This crime occurs when providers fail to remit federal payroll taxes to the IRS.

Most recently, payroll provider AccuPay sought bankruptcy protection after several clients sued the company for failing to send in federal tax payments to the IRS. When these scenarios occur, businesses often lose out on thousands of dollars that may impact their ability to continue operations. As the payroll taxes must still be paid to state and federal authorities, many small employers who don't have the funds available may fall into debt trying to repay the balances. New legislation, though, was recently proposed to protect small business owners from these abuses.

The bill would allow for greater oversight of third-party payroll companies, particularly by requiring them to register with the IRS, according to Accounting Today. The initiative would also mandate that the IRS send notifications to small business owners when their payroll providers suddenly change their address or go out of business.

While Miller called payroll tax fraud a "recurring problem," he has yet to make a determination about how the IRS plans to address the issue in the future, the news source concluded.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Most business owners and affluent Americans were pleased when lawmakers announced the $5.25 million - or $10.5 million for couples - estate tax exemption. Many middle-income individuals or local business owners may have put off estate planning strategies, thinking that they will never accrue or pass on enough wealth to meet the new thresholds. However, estate planning is crucial for nearly all individuals, and reaching the tax exemption levels may be more probable than many people realize.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/faltering-on-estate-planning-can-lead-to-thorny-wealth-transfer-issues" rel="attachment wp-att-2743"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2743" alt="estate" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/estate-300x153.jpg" width="300" height="153" /></a>A recent New York Times article highlighted this scenario, explaining that individuals or couples who dismiss frequent changes to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal tax law</a> today and later undergo a significant life event or change to their financial situation may pay for this oversight in the future. Assets are frequently fluctuating based on employment, marriages, births, deaths, and business success. Undergoing the initial phases of estate tax planning in the present may encourage individuals to stay abreast of future <a href="/fiscal-cliff-deal-has-various-estate-tax-implications/">changes to the Tax Code</a> that may impact them.

The <a href="/estate-tax-change-to-affect-nearly-15-million-households/">new changes to the Tax Code</a> have been labeled permanent, but many individuals with considerable assets remain concerned that lawmakers may change the exemption amounts in the future, the Times reports. One strategy business owners and affluent Americans are relying upon to provide additional measures of protection are a variety of trusts. Depending on the unique circumstances of each person, a trust has and continues to be one of the most highly utilized wealth transfer vehicles individuals are seeking to limit their tax exposure and keep their assets intact.

However, there are several types of trusts, each of which may differ to meet the specific needs a family. Therefore, individuals of all income classes may benefit from consulting a tax attorney who specializes in the field prior to setting up the vehicle.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Two changes to federal estate tax law suggest that income tax planning may become more important than <a href="/faltering-on-estate-planning-can-lead-to-thorny-wealth-transfer-issues/">estate planning</a> for most taxpayers.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-2755"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2755" alt="Estate_Tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Estate_Tax-300x102.jpg" width="282" height="94" /></a>First, the $5,250,000 federal estate tax exclusion (the “Exclusion”) is permanent. Thus, most estates will not be subject to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal estate tax</a> now that the Exclusion is law.  A married couple may pass $10,500,000 to their heirs free of federal estate tax using the sum of their two Exclusions.

Second, “portability” now permits a <a href="/accounting-for-personal-changes-during-estate-planning/">surviving spouse</a> to add the unused Exclusion of the deceased spouse to the Exclusion of the surviving spouse. Before portability, the exclusion was lost if it not was not applied to shelter a taxable transfer at the first death.  Today, portability lessens the importance funding a trust in the estate of the first-to-die.

Some practitioners believe that all assets should be held by the surviving spouse in order to obtain another step-up in basis at the second death. The assumption is that a step-up in basis at the second death will eliminate income taxation.  Where the value of the second estate is below the level of one or both Exclusions, the result is no tax.

There are counter arguments. An estate tax return must be filed to elect portability and we know that many taxpayers will fail to file and lose portability. I anticipate that there will be a number of cases where a surviving spouse remarries. What the public may not realize is that portability only extends to the last spouse. Thus, if the surviving spouse remarries, the anticipated result may not be achieved.  could It is also possible that, given the liquidity infused into the banking system by the Federal Reserve, inflation will result.  This could cause asset values to increase beyond the Exclusions for intermediate size estates.  Finally, the exemption for generation skipping tax is not portable and this fact suggests that funding a trust at the first death may still be beneficial.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-largest wealth manager, recently informed a number of American clients that the details of their accounts may receive an IRS information request. The Swiss bank noted that many of its American clients' accounts fall in line with the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax evasion probing</a> criteria outlined by the IRS, and therefore must be disclosed to the U.S. government.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/swiss-bank-julius-baer-receives-irs-information-request/irs_information_request/" rel="attachment wp-att-2767"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2767" alt="IRS_Information_request" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IRS_Information_request-300x262.jpg" width="220" height="191" /></a>While the IRS has been hesitant to disclose any information on its <a href="/audit-by-mail-more-common-with-irs/">probe into the accounts</a>, a spokesperson for the Zurich-based bank said that the request is in accordance with a double-taxation agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland that has been in place since 1996. However, the representative would not detail how many Americans are suspected of skirting their federal tax law obligations. The agency is currently looking at accounts that were opened or maintained by the bank between 2002 and 2012.

"The Swiss government is taking a broad interpretation of the treaty to allow the handover of data in cases involving offshore structures," Milan Patel, a former IRS trial attorney, told Bloomberg. "The banks seem willing to oblige to show they are cooperating with the U.S. once the Swiss government approves the turnover to avoid any violation under Swiss banking secrecy."

Julius Baer is one of 14 Swiss banks included in a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, which is focused on determining the banks' complicity in helping U.S. clients evade their taxes through the use of <a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">offshore accounts</a>. Many Swiss institutions have shied away from conducting business with wealthy American clients since the $780 million agreement between the U.S. and UBS AG, in which the bank admitted to helping U.S. clients circumvent federal tax laws, according to MarketWatch. Most recently, Switzerland's oldest financial institution, Wegelin &amp; Co., pleaded guilty in a Manhattan federal court to helping countless American clients conceal more than $1.2 billion from the IRS. The bank has since closed.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Running a business requires a great deal of time and commitment, and owners who are operating a busy enterprise may sometimes make the mistake of putting their succession plan on the back burner. However, an accident or unexpected medical disaster can change a business owner's circumstances quickly, making it imperative that they plan for the worst and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">establish a succession plan</a> to protect their venture.

<a href="procrastinating-succession-plan-can-leave-you-open-to-costly-mistakes" rel="attachment wp-att-2777"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2777" alt="sucession_plan" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sucession_plan-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>A recent Wealth Management article highlighted the common mistakes many entrepreneurs and business people make when holding off on establishing a plan, one of which is assuming that the successor will be ready on the owner's timeline. It's not uncommon for new successors to lack the proper training, a relationship with employees, financial know-how, and overall industry experience when they take on the job, but this scenario put the company in jeopardy.

This is a situation in which it pays to <a href="/core-elements-of-an-effective-succession-plan/">develop a succession plan</a> early on and ease new owners into the transition so that they will be fully equipped to take on the responsibilities of the company with confidence.

The source also noted that some owners consider succession to be an all or nothing transaction and believe they must give up all legal rights to the company. However, more of today's company heads are relying on trusts as a strategy to pass wealth onto new generations, maintain a measure of control in how the business is operated, and benefit from many estate tax law advantages.

As there is no one-size-fits-all approach to choosing the right trust for a succession business plan, contacting an attorney to set up the transaction may help owners make a more informed decision about their options.

As the current economic and regulatory climate continues to shift and business owners seek out new ways to protect their company assets, establishing a solid succession plan should be a central part of their overall wealth management strategy.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[This firm represents delinquent taxpayers and it is difficult to negotiate with taxing authorities because they must abide by certain numerical guidelines.  Recently, I was struck by an article in a quarterly newsletter of the American Bar Association Section of Taxation (Spring edition).   Jane Zhao, a Public Servicer Fellow and resident of Chicago, attempted to live for one month on the amount allowed by the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">IRS collection guidelines</a>. These guidelines are used by the IRS to grant taxpayers an allowance for living expenses before setting a repayment schedule. A single individual is entitled to $565 for food, housekeeping supplies, apparel, personal care products and services and miscellaneous products.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-collection-standards" rel="attachment wp-att-2787"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2787" alt="IRS_Collection" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IRS_Collection-250x300.jpg" width="147" height="177" /></a>Ms. Zhao spent all of her money on food and spent nothing on housekeeping supplies, apparel, personal care products and services and miscellaneous products. Her report reinforces the notion that the poor and middle class struggle to meet basic needs. She observed that a nationwide standard does not take into account the high <a href="/?s=cost+of+living">cost of living</a> in certain areas.

The IRS is not fond of a program that permits taxpayers to avoid paying all of its taxes.  Lee Sheppard of Tax Notes wrote that a tax return is not an opening offer in a negotiation. Despite renewed emphasis on the Offer in Compromise program, there are still substantial amounts outstanding. Perhaps it is time to ask if is the goal to collect all tax owed and encourage compliance or is it to collect whatever tax we can and narrow the deficit.

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has come under heat recently for questions over spending, particularly as it faces budgetary shortfalls and sequestration cuts that may impact its ability to detect, investigate, and prosecute potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a>.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-scrutiny-over-spending-continues" rel="attachment wp-att-2793"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2793" alt="over_spending" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/over_spending-300x138.jpg" width="231" height="106" /></a>Most recently, the preliminary findings of a report conducted by the Treasury Department's inspector general reveals the agency spent roughly $50 million to hold at least 220 conferences for employees between 2010 and 2012. The agency has come under fire for several unrelated incidents as of late, all of which led to the resignation of the agency's acting commissioner, Steven Miller. In light of the new spending report, new acting commissioner Daniel Werfel is seeking to distance the agency from the previous administration's spending mistakes.

Some analysts questioned the use of certain funds for <a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">IRS employee</a> conferences, specifically one held in Anaheim, California, in 2010. The conference, which brought together more than 2,600 IRS officials, came with a price tag of $4.1 million. However, $3.2 million of these funds came from the agency's unused enforcement budget, a move that IRS aides said does not violate the agency's guidelines, the Washington Post reports. At issue, however, are allegations that the agency failed to follow standard government practices of negotiating lower hotel rates and also provided workers with costly perks, such as stays in top hotel suites and tickets to sporting events, according to The Associated Press.

Following acknowledgement of the findings, the agency said it "has already taken aggressive and dramatic action to reduce conference spending," the AP reports.

"This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era," said Werfel, according to the AP. "While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred."

The scrutiny comes months after the agency was berated for producing Star Trek-themed IRS training videos to the tune of $60,000.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Starbucks Corporation and roughly a dozen other large conglomerates are taking individual appeals to lawmakers in the hopes of overhauling current tax law policies and expanding certain tax breaks, a new analysis reveals.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/will-starbucks-succeed-in-securing-new-u-s-tax-breaks" rel="attachment wp-att-2802"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2802" alt="tax_breaks" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tax_breaks-250x300.jpg" width="167" height="201" /></a>The Financial Times reports that the popular coffee chain, which maintains a global presence, reached out to lawmakers who are considering making changes to the U.S. Tax Code. The corporation proposed forgoing certain U.S. tax breaks, such as the domestic manufacturing deduction and accelerated depreciation for <a href="/businesses-affluent-americans-seek-irs-guidance-on-investment-tax/">business investments</a>, so long as its revenues could be used to lower the<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"> corporate tax rate</a>. The company also requested that taxes on royalty revenues be deferred until the money is brought back into the United States. Under the current laws, deferral is permitted only for international royalty payments coming in from unrelated franchisees, but not related parties associated with the company, the Times explains.

"Reform that provides consistent treatment of active royalties received from both unrelated parties and related parties ... would be good tax policy, would increase Starbucks' ability to compete in markets outside the US and would facilitate further growth of our company," Brian Ugai, Starbucks vice president for tax and customs, tells the Financial Times.

While it is unclear how lawmakers will treat the proposals, the Huffington Post notes that Starbucks is not the only large company lobbying for more favorable tax treatment from the Internal Revenue Service.

Other large conglomerates - including Apple, Microsoft, Honeywell, and Walt Disney - are also appealing to lawmakers and seeking out substantial tax breaks without facing the risk of noncompliance allegations. For example, Disney agreed to give up its rights to certain tax breaks if lawmakers would consider expanding certain tax benefits for new intellectual property in the U.S.

Although lawmakers are discussing several solutions for simplifying the tax code for corporations and helping the comply with U.S. laws, no concrete resolutions have been reached.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is leaning more heavily on technology to help detect potential tax law violations, and this trend is expected to continue as it faces limited manpower to execute compliance protocols and audits.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/small-businesses-may-be-subject-to-irs-robo-audits/robo_audits/" rel="attachment wp-att-2812"><img class="size-large wp-image-2812 aligncenter" alt="robo_audits" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/robo_audits-1024x89.jpg" width="404" height="35" /></a>Historically, the IRS has used so-called "robo-audits" to monitor inconsistencies in the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax returns</a> of middle-income Americans. However, a recent $3 billion technology upgrade to the tax agency's reporting infrastructure may enable it to move beyond individuals and incorporate small businesses into the system, a new analysis suggests.</p>
U.S. News and World Report notes that the agency uses the tax reporting system to <a href="/irs-robo-audits-raise-privacy-concerns/">conduct random auditing of returns</a>, namely on the returns of low- or middle-income individuals whose returns have been frozen. However, as the IRS focuses more on compliance, it may include small businesses in robo-auditing in an effort to better detect potential violations and recoup back taxes, penalties, and fees to close the tax gap.

"The IRS is now processing tax returns by checking them against data from third-party records of all credit-card and electronic-payment data providers," the news source wrote. "It is also using data from social media, email and other online activities. The IRS's own advisory boards have warned that the agency is not prepared for this step, and many problems will likely arise."

Despite these potential issues, the agency may continue to explore all of its options, particularly as it focuses the bulk of it's 2014 budget on compliance.

In a recent budgetary proposal submitted to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the agency requested an additional $1 billion from it's 2012 budget to increase staffing and bolster its enforcement. According to the breakdown, the agency wants to increase its enforcement by 6.93 percent, and its operations support by 13.51 percent. The IRS also indicated it hopes to improve individual and small business tax compliance by increasing its taxpayer services by 7.72 percent.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A court case against Yankees co-owner and managing partner Hal Steinbrenner ruled that he will not be required to repay the Internal Revenue Service $670,000 in what the agency called an <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">"erroneous" tax refund </a>that it mistakenly extended to Steinbrenner and his wife in 2009, a federal court ruled.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-loses-court-case-against-yankees-co-owner-hal-steinbrenner" rel="attachment wp-att-2831"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2831" alt="Court_case_against_Yankees" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Court_case_against_Yankees-1024x984.jpg" width="242" height="232" /></a>The issues go back to IRS audits of the <a href="/federal-grand-jury-investigates-dodgers-finances-under-mccourt-ownership/">Major League Baseball team's</a> parent company for 2001 and 2002, as well as amended returns filed by Steinbrenner during the 2001 tax year, Accounting Today reports. Hal Steinbrenner is one of the children of the late George Steinbrenner, the latter of whom settled the audit disputes in an agreement with the IRS in 2007. As part of that agreement, certain alterations were made to the tax returns of the beneficiaries of a family trust, including Hal Steinbrenner's share, the news source explains.

Following the adjustments, Hal Steinbrenner paid his taxes in 2008, and filed an amended 2001 tax return in 2009 seeking a refund as a result of a $6.8 million net operating loss carried back from 2002. The tax agency extended a refund to Steinbrenner, only to argue later that the amount never should have been approved because it passed the statute of limitations.

In a 19-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday detailed the intricacies of U.S. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> and said many of the phrases and jargon in the Internal Revenue Code are essentially "nonsense," according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Merryday referred to the complex tax rules as "the forbidding arcana of partnership taxation, a subject intractably muddled by archaically and chaotically composed - and therefore, nearly inscrutable - statutes and regulations and by the bold proliferation and proud maintenance of abstruse distinctions and obscure jargon," the Tampa Tribune reports.

The IRS failed to comment on the case, and has not yet announced whether it will appeal the ruling in federal court.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The State of Nevada spent considerable time and effort in crafting its <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">asset protection and dynasty trust statute</a>. Nevada worked hard to attract trust business to the state in an effort to broaden its economic base and decrease its reliance upon tourism and mining. Yet, one amendment to a piece of legislation nearly upset years of work.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/domestic-asset-protection-why-state-legislation-is-not-set-in-stone" rel="attachment wp-att-2840"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2840" alt="Asset_protection" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Asset_protection-673x1024.jpg" width="174" height="266" /></a>Nevada Assembly Bill 378 (Bill 378) acquired an amendment after introduction that would have neutralized Nevada’s<a href="/asset-protection-state-law-does-matter/"> ironclad asset protection</a>. Specifically, the amendment would have opened up Nevada trusts to claims of a future class of creditors consisting of spouses, domestic partners and children. Up to now, future creditors had been barred from piercing Nevada trusts to pay judgments.

Although local attorneys, accountants and trust companies responded to defeat Bill 378, this episode points out the pressures that state legislators may be subject to satisfy particular constituencies. The amendment was appended to Bill 378 in response to the urging of certain interest groups. The mere fact that this amendment was accepted is enough to give one pause when choosing an asset protection jurisdiction.

This type of legislation is less likely to be introduced in an offshore jurisdiction because of the economics. These jurisdictions rely heavily on its statutes, reputation and stability to attract trust business. Any threat to a foreign jurisdiction’s trust business would have greater economic impact upon a typically smaller economy heavily that is heavily dependent upon trust and financial business. Foreign trusts, with a flight clause as standard feature, would have fled a foreign jurisdiction before the ink was dry on legislation similar to Bill 378.

The same questions must be asked in selecting a jurisdiction, foreign or domestic. Bill 378 reminds us that we are only a pen stroke away from a reversal of fortune.  A trust fleeing one state for another may subject the trust to a new statute of limitations, claims of a fraudulent conveyance and other tax issues. Foreign jurisdictions are less likely to raise issues that would discourage new business.

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is increasing its focus on tax law compliance, as evidenced by the recent crackdown on offshore tax evasion and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">international financial-account sharing agreements</a> with popular tax havens. However, the IRS is zeroing in on a new potential gateway for tax evasion that may affect taxpayers of all income levels: virtual currency.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-to-hammer-down-on-bitcoins-virtual-currency" rel="attachment wp-att-2596"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2596" alt="Are-bitcoins-taxable" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Are-bitcoins-taxable.jpg" width="216" height="216" /></a><a href="/are-bitcoins-taxable-uncertainty-persists/">Bitcoins</a> recently exploded onto the scene, and the virtual currency has drawn attention from nearly every federal agency that investigates crime. The currency, once tied to drug trafficking and other crimes, is now thought to be another channel Americans can use to commit tax fraud, according to the Financial Times.

Scrutiny of virtual currency increased following the May arrest of five individuals associated with Costa Rican-based digital currency business Liberty Reserve. The workers are accused of running a $6 billion money-laundering scheme facilitated by virtual monies, and its clients were said to include identity thieves, drug lords, and computer hackers, the Times reports.

"Clearly, the increasing use and misuse of cyber-based currency and payment systems to anonymously transfer illicit funds as well as hide unreported income from the IRS is a threat that we are vigorously responding to," Victor Lessoff, IRS director of the cyber crimes unit, told the Financial Times. "The globalization and digitalization of our currencies is a significant emerging threat [...] It doesn't take much of a leap [to think] that these currencies would be used for tax evasion."

While the agency is still exploring its strategy options to detect, prevent and mitigate tax fraud committed through digital currency channels, one suggestion that may be implemented in the near future is requiring taxpayers to disclose whether they conduct any type of business through non-traditional financing means, such as the use of online financial accounts, including PayPal, according to the Telegraph.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Ray Lane, former chairman of <a href="/hp-loses-190-million-tax-shelter-case-against-irs/">Hewlett-Packard Co.</a>, and the Internal Revenue Service remain at odds over a reported $100 million tax bill which Lane plans to dispute.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-seeks-100-million-from-former-hp-chairman-ray-lane" rel="attachment wp-att-2861"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2861" alt="Ray Lane" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ray-Lane-1024x678.jpg" width="251" height="165" /></a>The businessman said he will appeal a ruling by the U.S. Tax Court which claims he owes roughly $100 million in taxes as a result of his participation in what the IRS calls an illegal tax shelter. The case stems back to the dot-com era when certain corporate tax shelters reined supreme. However, many of these havens are no longer recognized under U.S. tax law, and Lane may now face the ramifications of using a POPS shelter to generate "improperly" claimed losses of $251 million to offset income.

Lane argued that the IRS was wrong to say his partnership, Vanadium Partners Fund LLC, lacked "legitimate business purpose." He explained that the partnership invested in several start-up companies that later went under, which allowed the group to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">legitimately claim losses</a>. He also said that he has always been fully willing to cooperate with the IRS to reach a settlement, but that this process has been held up as a result of disagreements with remaining partners.

"It's from the year 2000. It was never a dispute by me; it was disputed by the partnership," Lane said in an interview with MarketWatch. "Part of that partnership has been disputing this for a long time."

Since 2000, the partnership invested in five companies, and also purchased stock options and warrants. However, the IRS argues that the investments in the companies "were payments of fees to promoters of listed and/or abusive tax avoidance transactions," according to Bloomberg. The agency  noted that because Lane and other investors failed to establish the value of stock options or warrants in an "amount greater than zero," the losses were not allowable under U.S. tax law, the news source added.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[This case in Topeka Kansas has been in the news since December 2012. Mr. William Marotta provided sperm for a child conceived through artificial insemination for a lesbian couple. The State of Kansas is seeking to hold Mr. Marotta responsible for child support despite the fact that Mr. Marotta relinquished his parental rights in a written agreement with the couple. The state is taking this step because the mother is no longer able to work and to support the child. [There is a motion pending to remove the Judge and the case appears to have stalled.]

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/kansas-sues-sperm-donor-for-child-support" rel="attachment wp-att-2874"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2874" alt="child_support" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/child_support-1024x768.jpg" width="275" height="206" /></a>There are two issues that attorneys address with clients in <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">trust and estate planning</a>.  One issue is how property should pass in the event of the deaths of designated heirs.  Would a testator or grantor of a trust consider the child in Topeka to be an heir?  I am certain that other family members would object to the inclusion of a stranger as a beneficiary.  This issue is not as remote as one might suspect.

The second issue is whether the interest of a beneficiary in a trust can be subject to levy or attachment in circumstances such as this.  Most trust instruments have spendthrift language to block creditors from accessing trust assets. There are, however, several unanswered questions. Is spendthrift language effective against a state seeking to enforce child support? Does the child have the rights of a beneficiary or is the child only a creditor?  Perhaps the trust instrument should require that the biological parent to retain parental rights before the child is entitled to distributions from the trust as an heir.

In addition to the foregoing issues, we know that a child can be conceived after the death of the sperm or egg donor. Should a parent or grandparent provide guidance for the trustee or simply rely upon the law of jurisdiction to catch up with science.

There are numerous trust and <a href="/faltering-on-estate-planning-can-lead-to-thorny-wealth-transfer-issues/">estate issues</a> that arise from these scenarios and I am certain that we will be paying more attention to the definition of heirs, issue and descendants.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[It is not difficult to construct a trust that will permit an individual to avoid income taxation on portfolio assets in the jurisdiction where he or she resides. The trust is drafted in such a way as to avoid having the grantor of the trust receiving income distributions.  The client may, at some point in the future, receive a distribution of the untaxed income from the accumulation or principal in the Trust.  If the individual resides in a high tax jurisdiction, the savings equals the state income taxes that would otherwise be paid.  The States of Delaware and Nevada are popular locations for such trusts known as Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor Trusts (<a href="/estate-planning-acronyms-for-the-remainder-of-2012/">DINGS</a>) and Nevada. Incomplete Non-Grantor Trusts (NINGS).

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/avoiding-state-income-taxation-on-portfolio-assets" rel="attachment wp-att-2885"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2885" alt="Income_taxation_on_portfolio_assets" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Income_taxation_on_portfolio_assets-1024x566.jpg" width="299" height="165" /></a>The State of Delaware will not tax a DING if there is no beneficiary who is a resident.  Delaware permits the DING to take an <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">income tax deduction</a> for income that is accumulated for eventual distribution to a beneficiary who is a non-resident of Delaware. Because a DING is a non-grantor trust for income tax purposes, the grantor will not be taxed in his or her state of residence on the income earned by a DING.  This is the pillar on which a DING rests.

Nevada does not impose a state income tax on individuals or trusts; therefore, it does not require NINGs to use an accumulation deduction to avoid tax. Nevada trust companies and local attorneys are proponents of the strategy and it is most useful for residents of the high tax State such as California.

Assume a wealthy individual can save $30,000 in state income taxes and can reinvest the savings at 6%. After 20 years, the amount saved would grow to over $1,000,000 with reinvestments.

Grantors are not prevented from being permissible beneficiaries of principal.  Remember, once income is taxed and not distributed, it becomes principal and can be distributed for health, maintenance and support.  Clearly, any portfolio income not being consumed for support may benefit from this strategy.

A recent private letter ruling clarified some tax issues that existed with respect to DINGS and NINGS and we now expect renewed activity as the result.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The estate of the former Detroit Pistons' owner Bill Davidson is challenging the Internal Revenue Service over what could be one of the largest and most substantial estate tax law cases heard in recent years.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/former-nba-team-owners-estate-challenges-irs-on-1-9-billion-in-estate-gift-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-2895"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2895" alt="Gift_taxes" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gift_taxes-954x1024.jpg" width="168" height="181" /></a>Representatives for the late Davidson filed a suit in the U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C., arguing that the IRS wrongly claimed roughly $2 billion in underpayments of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate and gift taxes, penalties, and interest</a>. However, the true amount the IRS may go after might reach as high as $2.8 billion, although the estate may not be required to pay more than $2 billion, the Detroit Free Press reports.

The issue surrounding Davidson's estate and <a href="/irs-goes-after-billionaire-sumner-redstone-for-1972-tax-gift/">gift taxes</a> revolves around several transactions and transfers he made to children and grandchildren prior to his death in 2009. Davidson, who owned several sports franchises during his life, established trusts worth tens of millions of dollars for each of his survivors. However, the IRS claims that the accountants managing the transactions undervalued privately held Guardian stock placed in those trusts by as much as $1,500 per share, the Free Press reports. In addition, the value of other key assets is also being debated by the IRS and Davidson's estate, the representatives of which argue that the federal agency is overvaluing certain assets.

The IRS is also scrutinizing gifts Davidson made, many of which date back into the mid-2000s, arguing that he failed to pay the correct amount of taxes on sizable sums. The news source reports that the total value of these gifts may amount to more than $900 million.

Bill Davidson ranked No. 62 on Forbes' list of richest men in the U.S. in 2008, during which time his net worth was estimated to be $5.5 billion. Representatives of his estate argue that he owes nothing more to the IRS than what was already paid out in estate taxes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service's recent crackdown on tax evasion and fraud may have initially appeared to be an American phenomenon, but tax law violations appear to be an international issue. As the leaders of the international community meet for the upcoming G-8 summit, <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax issues and combating tax evasion</a> are expected to top the list of the summit's priorities in 2013.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit" rel="attachment wp-att-2905"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-2905" alt="tax-evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tax-evasion-786x1024.jpg" width="221" height="288" /></a>Taxes are central to maintaining countries' economic viability, and the U.S. along with other developed nations consider closing the tax gap and cracking down on crimes that are taking away from federal revenue to be crucial in strengthening their economies. Currently, the eurozone is in a double-dip recession, while the Japanese trade deficit continues to widen. Economic growth in the U.S., while steady, remains slow. Further, foreign banks that have been found to be complicit in helping Americans evade taxes are facing fines, lawsuits and other financial consequences that may impact their solvency. Most notably, Wegelin and Co., Switzerlands's oldest bank and the 13th oldest financial institution in the world, was forced to close its doors after admitting to helping U.S. tax evaders carry out their crimes.

In response to these issues, the U.S. has <a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">entered into international agreements</a> with several other countries to share information about account holders with offshore accounts. In addition to investigating the more than $8.5 trillion tied up in offshore accounts, the U.S. is also examining the tax habits of the largest corporations, such as Apple, Inc. and Starbucks.

Leaders of the G-8 Summit argue that coordinated global action is essential in helping curb and detect tax avoidance and evasion, according to Reuters. The countries that make up the G-8 - Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia - plan to encourage territories and popular tax havens to enter into multinational agreements that emphasize transparency and better reporting standards.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service, lawmakers and Americans began paying more attention to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists following its public release of hundreds of names and financial details of offshore account holders in April. Now, the ICIJ has released a new report, which gives the public access to extensive offshore tax haven records through its new Offshore Leaks Database.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/offshore-tax-haven-report" rel="attachment wp-att-2914"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2914" alt="Offshore_tax-havens" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Offshore_tax-havens-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a>The system contains hundreds of thousands of records detailing corporations, rather than individuals, that hold sizable assets in popular tax-havens. The consortium gained this information from roughly 2.5 million emails and financial documents it received in 2012, according to the Huffington Post. While lawmakers and the IRS will have ultimate say over whether any of the data in the documents constitute potential <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> violations, the release of the documents may increase the already-intense scrutiny of corporations and their use of certain tax practices to limit their liability.

This is particularly true after a 2012 report from the Tax Justice Network found that untaxed wealth invested in offshore tax havens ranged from $28 to $32 trillion, an amount that is equal to two years' worth of U.S. economic output.

Several corporations, including Apple, Starbucks, Disney, and Microsoft have made headlines as of late due to lawmakers' questioning over their taxes, and some - including Starbucks and Disney - have lobbied for more flexibility over their use of certain benefits and deductions. While scrutiny of many big-name firms continues, some analysts predict that new international agreements between several countries and the U.S. may provide more insight and transparency in corporate tax practices, which could potentially lead to more legal challenges of certain tax safeguards. Already, the Group of Eight <a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/">(G-8) has named tax evasion</a> and tax avoidance a key talking point at this year's summit, indicating that a heavier emphasis on tax compliance is soon to become a global issue.]]></content>

The descendent died in 2006 and his executors filed a New Jersey Estate Tax Return in July 2007 paying tax on the value of an IRA that was managed by Bernard L. Madoff Securities LLC.  The value of the IRA was provided to the estate by the custodian, an entity controlled by Mr. Bernard Madoff.  You may recall that Mr. Madoff  was arrested in December 2008 and he pled guilty to various charges on March 12, 2009.

In January 2009, the estate filed a claim for refund of estate taxes because the IRA was always worthless, even before death. The Division of Taxation (the “Division”) denied the refund claim and the estate sued in Tax Court. The Tax Court decision ordered the Division to pay the refund.  The Division appealed and won a reversal in the Appellate Division.  The Appellate Division held that no one had knowledge of the Ponzi scheme at the date of death; therefore, the value of the IRA for New Jersey <a href="/judge-grants-madoff-victim-a-refund-on-estate-taxes/">estate tax</a> purposes was the overstated value reported by the custodian.

The <i>Warshaw </i>case is an example of when and to what extent post-death events are considered in valuing assets for estate tax purposes. This area is unsettled and taxpayers may not find consistency between state and federal decisions.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When individuals and business owners begin estate planning, establishing a will and testament is often their first priority. In cases of high net-worth households and those who plan to pass business assets onto the next generation, a trust is also another popular element of estate planning. However, one of the most underutilized components that too few people may use when creating a comprehensive estate plan is utilizing current <a href="/former-nba-team-owners-estate-challenges-irs-on-1-9-billion-in-estate-gift-taxes/">gift tax</a> allowances.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/dont-leave-gift-taxes-out-of-estate-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-2676"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2676" alt="IRS_collection" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tax_Gift-300x167.jpg" width="254" height="141" /></a>The gift tax, which is indexed for inflation each year, enables individuals and spouses to gift a certain dollar amount - either in assets or monies - to family members, friends, business associates and the like up to a certain amount on a tax-free basis. For the 2013 year, individuals can gift up to $14,000, while spouses can gift a combined $28,000. Because the funds are not taxable, individuals can successfully lower their taxable income, which reduces the amount of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate taxes</a> that may levied in the future. For 2013, a deceased individual's estate is not subject to estate tax at the federal level until its value exceeds $5.25 million.

This method is a popular strategy for transferring wealth while an individual is still alive, and also has the added benefit of giving donors more control and authority on how the proceeds are used, according to Fox Business. For example, business owners who are grooming children or business associates to take over the business may choose to gift investments, property, or other assets while they are still alive to advise successors on how the gifts should be used.

As an added benefit, taxpayers are permitted to make these gifts to as many recipients as they wish without those gifts facing federal taxes, assuming they stay within the current thresholds. Therefore, for those who are planning to distribute a portion of their estate to several beneficiaries, making full use of the gift tax law to begin transferring assets can greatly help reduce the amount at which the final estate will be taxed.]]></content>

<b>Statement</b>:  I can give a gift of $13,000 (in 2012) to a person or trust and I do not have to file a gift tax return.

<b>Reply</b>:  You do not have to file a gift tax return if you make only Annual Exclusion gifts which are defined as a gift to one person of a <i>present interest</i> that does not exceed the annual limitation (of $13,000 in 2012).  A gift in 2012 of $13,000 in cash to an individual qualifies as a gift of a <i>present interest</i>.. The gift of $13,000 to a trust is a gift of a future interest and does not automatically qualify as an Annual Exclusion Gift. [There are exceptions for gifts made to trusts that require a professional to explain.]

<b>Statement:  </b>I can give a gift of $26,000 to one person then use my spouse’s annual exclusion and not file a gift tax return.

<b>Reply:</b>  No.

<b>Statement</b>:  Annual exclusion gifts are not taxable in New Jersey.

<b>Reply</b>:  Although there is no gift tax in New Jersey, these gifts, called transfers, may be added back into the taxable state for Inheritance Tax and New Jersey Estate Tax purposes if transfers are made within three (3) years of death. If a Federal Estate Tax Return must be filed, the New Jersey Estate Tax follows the federal treatment of these gifts.

<b>Statement</b>:  I may reimburse a person for medical care expenses he or she paid and have this reimbursement qualify for the Annual Exclusion.

<b>Reply</b>:  No. You must make payment directly to the medical provider. If you pay the provider, you are not required to file a gift tax return to report this transaction even if the payment exceeds $13,000 in 2012, provided you have no other gifts that must be reported.

<b>Statement</b>:  I can reimburse my child for my grandchild’s living expenses at college.

<b>Reply</b>:  No. You must pay the educational institution directly and only <i>qualified educational expenses</i> are eligible for favorable treatment.  Consult with your tax advisor as to what constitutes <i>qualified educational expenses. </i>Beer and pizza do not qualify.

<b>Statement:</b>  A gift to a §529 Plan is a completed gift at the time of contribution to the plan.

<b>Reply</b>:  True. This is based on the statute which was amended to address this point. Prior to amendment, death of the custodian of the §529 Plan who was also the donor was a problem with inclusion for estate tax.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Rising interest rates in the Treasury market is a warning that it is about to become more costly to make certain gifts or to sell assets to related parties.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/rising-interest-rates-will-make-certain-gifts-more-costly" rel="attachment wp-att-2966"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2966" alt="Rising_Interest_Rates" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rising_Interest_Rates-249x300.jpg" width="249" height="300" /></a>The yield on Treasury securities is used as a yardstick for setting the interest rates that related parties must charge one another when transferring property in a sale.  These rates also establish the annuity that must be paid when using a Grantor Annuity Trust (<a href="/remedial-steps-to-protect-a-grat-holding-facebook-stock/">GRAT</a>) or Charitable Lead Annuity Trust (CLAT).  The benchmark rates, known as the Applicable Federal Rates (AFR), are published monthly. The benefit of low interest rates was the asset being transferred did not have to generate a great deal of income to make the payment required. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">Tax planners</a> often refer to the AFR as the hurdle rate for this obvious reason.

Where there is an inter-family sale of an asset, a higher interest rate means the asset must produce more cash or income to make the required payment. Another drawback to an increase in interest rates is that there is less debt service coverage. The income and estate tax consequences of higher payments are also greater because more money is being returned to the seller thereby increasing the size of the estate.

When property is transferred to a GRAT at a time when the AFR is low, the annuity is fixed at a low amount.  An increase in the future performance of the asset means there will be an increase, in excess of the required annuity payment, and the excess inures to the benefit of the heirs.  Today is a very favorable time to use a GRAT to transfer income producing real estate or a business that are expected to do well in the coming years.

The same reasoning applies to a CLAT which is a trust that pays an annuity to charity for a term of years.  The heirs will receive the remainder at the end of the term and any increase in income becomes part of the remainder.

Inflation in asset values is another reason to act today to remove the increase from your taxable estate and pass the increase to your heirs.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When it comes to formulating an <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate plan</a>, many individuals focus on the assets that hold direct monetary value, such as cash, retirement accounts, life insurance, trusts, real estate, and physical property. Many affluent individuals and business owners rely on trusts or the use of the lucrative gift tax law to transfer these assets to beneficiaries and lower their taxable estate. However, one component many people forget to account for revolves around their digital assets, which are all too often left out of their formal estate plan.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/dont-leave-digital-assets-out-of-the-estate-plan" rel="attachment wp-att-2981"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2981" alt="Digital_assets" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Digital_assets-300x253.jpg" width="247" height="208" /></a>Digital assets can cover a wide variety of ground, and may encompass everything from email and social media accounts, software licenses, blogs, images and music, and financial accounts. This information may be stored on several different cloud portals, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, storage devices, and smartphones.

Because <a href="/dont-overlook-digital-records-during-estate-planning/">digital assets</a> can hold both sentimental and monetary value, it's crucial to draw up a beneficiary plan for these items to help the estate process go by more quickly and avoid disputes among family members that could tie up the process. For example, individuals who have underage children or a combination of biological children and step-children may have specific instructions about who retains the rights to certain digital assets. In some states, default laws may not automatically favor kids under 18 or make provisions for step-children who have not been adopted by the deceased individual. Therefore, having a legal document drawn up and included in an estate plan can provide more clarity if ownership disputes arise.

Some digital assets are increasingly coming up tax scrutiny, such as the ownership of Bitcoins. This digital currency is currently on the Internal Revenue Service's radar as the agency attempts to establish new rules regarding its tax treatment. Owners should take the evolving scope of tax law into effect when making decisions about digital assets that may one day hold monetary value.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The 3.8% income tax surcharge (the “Surcharge”) is a new concern faced by trustee. The current investment environment poses challenges to invest in a manner that will produce enough income to satisfy beneficiaries. Trustees of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">trusts that own business assets</a> may avoid the surcharge if the income earned from the business is deemed active rather than passive in nature. The determination of income as active or passive is difficult for several reasons. The rules, called the passive los rules, require material participation on the part of the trustee in order to characterize the trust’s income as active. These rules were enacted to put a stop to the tax shelter industry and are intentionally restrictive.  There are few cases and little in the way of guidance on what actions constitute material participation on the part of the trustee. A Trustee is faced with a dilemma. Does the trustee take the safe route and pay the extra tax? In the alternative, does the trustee attempt to structure his actions so that participation is material, regular and continuous.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/may-a-trust-avoid-the-3-8-income-tax-surcharge" rel="attachment wp-att-2991"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2991" alt="3.8_percent_Income_Tax_Surcharge" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/3.8_percent_Income_Tax_Surcharge-249x300.jpg" width="186" height="224" /></a>A recent IRS ruling applied the passive loss rules to two trusts that owned an S corporation. The S corporation was the sole owner of a qualified subchapter S subsidiary (QSub) corporation, which was the operating company. The same person was trustee of both trusts and another person was the special trustee and president of the QSub. The taxpayer argued that the management decisions and personal supervision of the business by the special trustee should be attributed to the trusts thereby making the income active rather than passive and escaping the imposition of the Surcharge.

The ruling analyzed the activities of the special trustee to assess whether they were regular, continuous and substantial. The ruling held that simply voting shares of stock did not constitute material participation and therefore the income was passive and subject to the Surcharge. The ruling focuses on the fact that the special trustee was limited in his authority by the terms of the trust and therefore special trustee could not have materially participated.  Stated another way, he was acting as an officer and not as trustee.

This issue of material participation will arise more frequently as trust laws in more states are amended to permit the use of special trustees to administer businesses and other <a href="/asset-protection-state-law-does-matter/">special assets</a>. Previously trust companies were reluctant to administer special assets because trustees were limited by a more restrictive standard. A special trustee may administer a business as a prudent businessperson would do without liability to the trustee.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many small business owners want to keep their legacy intact by passing down their companies to family members. A viable succession plan is essential for these owners in not only passing down assets, but also doing so in a way that minimizes tax liability and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/">legal complications</a>.

<a href="/procrastinating-succession-plan-can-leave-you-open-to-costly-mistakes/">A strong succession plan</a> will center not only around grooming heirs to take on key business functions, but also around estate tax planning. The current estate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> allows individuals to avoid taxes on estates valued at no more than $5.25 million, or $10.5 million for spouses who file jointly. In addition, the gift tax enables individuals and business owners to gift up to $14,000 - or $28,000 for joint filers - to as many individuals as they wish. Keeping these two exemptions in mind, business owners may h<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/gifts-should-be-a-crucial-part-of-your-business-succession-plan" rel="attachment wp-att-2998"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2998" alt="Business_succession_Plan" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Business_succession_Plan-300x263.jpg" width="240" height="210" /></a>ave more leeway when it comes to establishing a succession plan that keeps their tax liability low.

The first step is to hire an appraiser to conduct a business valuation. When business owners don't know the true value of their assets, tax planning becomes more challenging and their estates may be forced to pay out more in taxes than the company head intended. Once the true value is determined, owners can make more informed decisions about managing their affairs. As an example, businesses that are high in value will undoubtedly be subject to more taxes, and owners can avoid this scenario by gifting assets to successors to reduce their taxable estate.

Gifts can be made in the form of real estate, cash, investments, and other business property on a tax-free basis. This method can also be particularly impactful if owners plan to have several successors, as it allows them to transfer larger chunks of their business to heirs. In addition to gifting, owners might also consider setting up a trust for successors that enables them to manage or monitor certain business functions and investments and provide guidance to beneficiaries.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In one of the largest coordinated global tax evasion strategies in history, the United States is on pace to open up registration to foreign financial firms that service U.S. clients on July 15, 2013.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/global-tax-evasion-compliance-deadline-nears" rel="attachment wp-att-3008"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3008" alt="global_tax_evasion" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/global_tax_evasion-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>The financial industry continues to lobby for more time and the Internal Revenue Service has not yet released registration procedures and guidelines. However, the U.S. government is still set to begin enrolling investment companies, banks, and insurance groups in its registry in an effort to further the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</a> (FATCA) of 2010 and significantly cut down on multimillion-dollar tax law violations, Reuters reports. Foreign financial institutions are required to complete registration by October 25 to avoid penalties that will be levied beginning on January 1, 2014.

Many financial institutions and industry professionals argue that registration may be severely stunted, however, if the U.S. Treasury fails to put up guidelines and further instruction immediately. Some anticipate registration backlogs as a result of these delays, and others contend that the IRS may be forced to delay the implementation of penalties if they don't put up instructions quickly enough, Reuters reports. The Treasury Department - which delayed FATCA requirements in the past - has not yet said whether it plans to postpone the upcoming deadline.

Separately, it appears that many <a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">Americans with foreign accounts</a> are withdrawing funds at faster rates ahead of the new law. For example, Israeli banks estimate that American clients have withdrawn roughly $4 billion from their institutions over the last two years, a move they attribute to tighter tax scrutiny, Israeli news source Globes reports.

"The blow is not just in the drop in assets, but also in the drop in investments," a banking source told Globes. "Some of these customers, especially the wealthy ones, use the money to make investments and acquisitions in Israel. There is now little chance that they will make these investments, after they moved the money back to the U.S."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling that the Defense Against Marriage Act (DOMA) is unconstitutional will have far-reaching benefits that change the paradigm of health benefits enrollment, retirement benefits, and tax planning. Regarding the latter, same-sex married couples may see sweeping changes to their <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax planning and gift tax rules</a>.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/doma-ruling-may-have-estate-tax-planning-implications/estate_tax_planning/" rel="attachment wp-att-3015"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3015" alt="estate_tax_planning" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/estate_tax_planning-300x234.jpg" width="240" height="187" /></a>Under current tax rules, individuals can exempt $5.25 million of their estates from taxes, and may gift up to $14,000 in tax free income to as many people as they can afford for the 2013 year. These amounts double for <a href="/irs-states-that-civil-unions-should-be-treated-as-husband-and-wife-for-income-tax-purposes/">married couples</a> filing jointly. According to the previous law, same-sex couples were prohibited from utilizing the estate tax law to pass assets to spouses or make larger gifts to beneficiaries by filing jointly with a spouse. However, couples who live in states that recognize same-sex marriage will now have the same benefits as heterosexual married couples and may share assets without being subject to gift taxes. As a result, this may give them more flexibility when it comes to estate and gift tax planning.

The changes may also play a role in succession planning, particularly if same-sex married couples choose to pass assets, business interests and property to beneficiaries. Previous tax law would have prevented same-sex couples' marital status from being recognized by the federal government. Therefore, couples would have been limited to gifting $14,000 in gifts and the $5.25 million estate tax exemption, rather than combining these amounts by filing jointly and passing more on to heirs.

As the ruling is still new and various parties - including employers and benefit providers - attempt to determine how the laws will apply to them, working with a legal professional may help couples navigate the law and make the most informed decisions to plan their estates effectively.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Robert and William Pohlad, sons of late Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad, who passed away in 2009, have brought a lawsuit against IRS regarding a disputed $189 million tax bill.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/pohlad-estate-brings-lawsuit-against-irs-over-189-million-tax-bill-regarding-minnesota-twins" rel="attachment wp-att-2895"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2895" alt="Gift_taxes" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gift_taxes-279x300.jpg" width="279" height="300" /></a>The IRS recently imposed the multi million-dollar <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax liability</a> on the heirs, arguing that Pohlad's estate undervalued his stake in the Minnesota Twins, according to Forbes. In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. Tax Court, Pohlad's estate valued the late owner's stake in the Minnesota Twins at $24 million for tax purposes. However, IRS auditors disputed these figures and valued his stake at approximately $293 million. In response, the IRS tacked on $121 in additional taxes, and imposed a 40 percent penalty for "gross valuation misstatement" that amounts to an added $48 million, Forbes reports.

Further, after scrutinizing a series of wealth transfer methods Pohlad utilized to pass assets on to his heirs, the IRS also claims that he undervalued the gifts he made to beneficiaries. Pohlad made full use of the <a href="/dont-leave-gift-taxes-out-of-estate-planning/">gift tax law</a> when passing considerable wealth to heirs, and stated that the gifts he transferred amounted to $129 million. However, auditors later argued that Pohlad made $446 in taxable gifts.

Pohlad's sons are the executors of his estate, and assert that all estate and gift taxes have been paid to the IRS. In the lawsuit, the estate asserted that it paid the $16 million in gift taxes and $26 million in estate taxes.

Several high-profile estate tax cases between the IRS and late sports team owners are currently ongoing, the most recent of which is a lawsuit waged by the estate of Detroit Pistons' former owner Bill Davidson, who received a $1.9 billion tax bill from the IRS. In some ways similar to the Pohlad case, the IRS charges that Davidson undervalued millions in private stock that was passed down to heirs. The estate, meanwhile, asserts that all estate and gift taxes paid to the agency were accurate.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Occasionally, cases present fact patterns that were unanticipated at the time I was in law school. Today, however, a person’s ability to anticipate these situations is guided by the dramatic changes in medicine and reproductive technology. In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Burnett</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">v</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Burnett</span>, a guardian filed a <a href="/?s=divorce">divorce action</a> on behalf of the ward for the primary purpose of Medicaid planning. The Michigan court was faced with two non-traditional <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">trust issues</a> raised by the Guardian.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/a-non-traditional-trust-issue-gender-reassignment" rel="attachment wp-att-3036"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3036" alt="non_traditional_trust_issues" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/non_traditional_trust_issues-290x300.jpg" width="207" height="215" /></a>The facts are that a traditional couple was married in the 1980s. One spouse underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2003. The State of Michigan did not recognize same-sex marriages in 2003, so a question arose as to whether the reassignment surgery operated to end the marriage. The Court held that the sexual reassignment did not invalidate the marriage. The reason the action was filed was to obtain a divorce in order to preserve assets. The court held that the Guardian had the authority to file an action for divorce and that Medicaid planning was a valid reason.

One issue that was not part of the case before the Michigan court was whether the reassigned partner could remain a beneficiary of a hypothetical trust. Most trusts that are funded and operating today were probably drafted before advances in reproductive and reassignment. Most trusts provide for children, grandchildren and occasionally for their spouses. Many trusts require that the in-law remain legally married to the descendant to continue as an eligible beneficiary. Suppose the sexually reassigned partner was a son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Would customary language exclude this person as a beneficiary because the marriage is no longer recognized under state law?

What does a trustee do when presented with these facts? Does the trustee seek to limit its liability from claims of other beneficiaries by taking the position that the couple is no longer married under the terms of the trust or state law? What would the outcome be if the couple and the trust resided in different states with the law of each jurisdiction being different?]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is taking a closer examination of corporations' tax strategies during the 2004 tax holiday, and two technology firms in particular have drawn scrutiny from the federal agency.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-embattled-with-technology-firms-over-2004-corporate-tax-holiday" rel="attachment wp-att-2787"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2787" alt="IRS_Collection" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IRS_Collection-250x300.jpg" width="192" height="230" /></a>In two separate <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> cases, the IRS is battling BMC Software Inc. and Analog Devices, both of which are citing a 2004 corporate tax holiday to dispute new tax bills the agency imposed, Reuters reports. Current tax laws enable U.S. companies that operate internationally to avoid paying taxes on the profits on the funds so long as they remain overseas.

In an effort to boost investment in the U.S. and act as an incentive to large scale and profitable multinationals, the controversial 2004 law paved the way for global corporations to enjoy a reduced tax rate for profits that were earned overseas but brought back to the United States.

Regarding both the BMC and Analog issues, the two <a href="/it-nonprofit-urges-businesses-to-identify-fiscal-cliff-tax-implications/">technology companies</a> settled pricing transfer disputes with the IRS in 2005, around the same period when BMC repatriated $717.2 million and Analog brought $1 billion back to the U.S, according to Reuters. However, the IRS later levied a tax bill for $12.9 million against BMC and $26 million against Analog, arguing that the settlements increased both companies' domestic profits, which are taxable, the news source added.

Reuters notes that the cases are thought to be the first legal tests of the tax holiday, and many corporations are watching the outcomes closely. As the IRS plans to scrutinize the tax practices of large corporations more closely in an effort to close the multibillion-dollar tax gap, the case may be of particular interest to those large companies that are currently or have recently faced disputes with the agency over corporate profits.

The IRS refused to comment on either case, noting that it is not at liberty to discuss ongoing cases.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many farmers and ranchers that are nurturing hundreds of acres of property were relieved when lawmakers announced the 2013 <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate and gift tax legislation</a>, which made it significantly less costly to pass down land and assets to successors and new generations. However, given that today's farming producers own significant swathes of land - most of which has been in their families for generations - some are lobbying for more flexible rules that will make wealth transfers easier.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/farmers-ranchers-lobby-for-better-estate-gift-tax-legislation" rel="attachment wp-att-3057"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3057" alt="gift_tax_legislation" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gift_tax_legislation-300x198.jpg" width="246" height="162" /></a>Under the existing estate and gift tax laws, farmers can pass $5 million - $5.25 million, once indexed for inflation - in farmland, equipment, and other assets to successors without triggering estate taxes. This is a significant allowance, as the allowances were initially set to revert back to the 2001 rate of $1 million. The current exemption doubles to $10.5 million for joint filers. In addition, lawmakers also raised the gift tax threshold to $14,000 - or $28,000 for married joint filers - up from $13,000 in 2012.

Duane Hund, an extension farm management specialist with Kansas State University, notes that the changes are uniquely positive for farmers, as potential taxes on property over that amount are capped at 40 percent, or 10 percentage points lower than if Congress hadn't acted, according to the Kansas City Star. Further, Hund noted that the portability of the exemption is a new feature that will greatly facilitate wealth transfers for farmers. The new portability rule means that should a husband or wife pass away and leave an estate that is smaller than the $5.25 million exemption, the surviving spouse can add the unused amount to her or his own $5.25 million exemption at the second death.

Although farmers and ranchers are in a much better position, the American Farm Bureau is lobbying lawmakers to repeal the<a href="/doma-ruling-may-have-estate-tax-planning-implications/"> federal estate tax</a> altogether.

"Individuals, family partnerships and family corporations own 98 percent of our nation's 2 million farms and ranches," said AFBF president Bob Stallman. "When estate taxes on an agricultural business exceed cash and other liquid assets, surviving family partners may be forced to sell land, buildings, or equipment needed to keep their businesses running."]]></content>

NII includes interest, dividends, rents, royalties or income from a trade or business that is a passive activity under IRC §469 (Passive Loss Rules). <a href="/may-a-trust-avoid-the-3-8-income-tax-surcharge/">A trust can avoid the 3.8% tax</a> by distributing NII, in other words, becoming a "Special Trustee". The threshold is called Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and is equal to $11,950 for trusts, $250,000 for a married couple and $125,000 for a single filer. (MAGI may be subject to other adjustments that are not covered here.) The 3.8% tax may be avoided if MAGI of the recipient beneficiaries is below the MAGI threshold applicable to their filing status.

Where a profitable business is held in trust and the beneficiary has other substantial income, distribution of income from the Trust may not avoid the 3.8% tax. One should also note that trust may not have been intended to provide the beneficiaries with substantial distributions. The grantor of the trust may have intended that income be accumulated rather than distributed. The income could be accumulated for future needs or a nest egg. It may be accumulated in order to encourage the beneficiary to become self-reliant and a productive member of society. In either case, avoiding the 3.8% tax is important.

Interest, dividends, royalties and rents may be excluded from the definition of NII if they are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Having a trade or business makes the income active and avoids the 3.8% tax on passive income. How does a trust owning stock in an S corporation that operates a business qualify for this exception?  How does a limited liability company that owns a shopping center qualify where it provides substantial services?

The IRS takes (and litigates) the position that only the direct actions of the trustee may be considered in determining whether a trust materially participates in the business thereby converting income from passive subject to 3.8% tax to active income and avoiding this tax. Some states permit a trustee to delegate authority to agents (e.g. Estate of Carter in Texas) while other states permit the use of <i>special trustees</i> whose sole function is to operate the business.

Now is the time to review trusts and the income earned. States that permit the use of special trustees and self-directed trusts are closer to solving the problem.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Financial institutions around the world will have more time to comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) as the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department will delay implementation of the withholding provision until July 1, 2014.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/treasury-irs-delay-fatca-withholding-provision" rel="attachment wp-att-3105"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3105" alt="FATCA" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FATCA-300x198.jpg" width="261" height="172" /></a>The agencies said high interest in the program from financial institutions prompted it to delay the program by six months to give banks, insurers, and investment companies more time to enroll and comply. In addition, the Treasury Department noted that the delay of the withholding and account due diligence requirements will help ensure the program runs efficiently.

"Given the groundswell of international interest in FATCA, we are providing an additional six months to complete agreements with countries and jurisdictions across the globe, before withholding begins," said Treasury deputy assistant secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack. "The high volume of international participation in this effort represents a quintessential race to the top. Every additional country we bring on board means we are one step closer to winning the fight against <a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/">offshore tax evasion</a>."

Although the withholding requirements are extended, the delay will not impact the provision governing the report of information, which is still set to begin in 2015. However, the FATCA registration website, which was set to be unveiled to participating institutions on July 15, will be opened on August 19.

The announcement is a welcomed one by financial institutions in other countries, which have been lobbying for months for more time to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">comply with the tax law</a>. Further, the IRS has yet to issue enrollment and reporting guidelines, which many institutions believed would result in a backlog and inefficient processing. Many also argued that if the IRS failed to post guidelines, the agency should hold off on assessing penalties against participating firms who would be rushed to comply.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A practitioner commented many years ago that the effectiveness of a tax planning technique can be measured by the strength of government opposition to it.  One need only look at the President’s tax plan and the Treasury’s <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Explanations of the Administration’s Fiscal Year 2013 Proposals</span> </i>(page 80) to see that Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) are effective.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/rolling-grats-and-shelf-grats-time-to-lock-in-low-interest-rates" rel="attachment wp-att-3116"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3116" alt="GRATS" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GRATS-300x152.jpg" width="277" height="152" /></a>A GRAT is a trust to which the Grantor transfers property in exchange for an annuity to be received for a period of time selected by the Grantor.  The transfer to the GRAT is reported as a gift at the fair market value of the property reduced by the annuity. A transfer is assumed to grow at a rate of interest set by the IRS.  Taxpayers hope the property transferred will appreciate in value or earn more income than the assumed interest rate, which is 1.4% in July. Where a <a href="/remedial-steps-to-protect-a-grat-holding-facebook-stock/">GRAT </a>earns income or appreciates in value in excess of 1.4%, the excess is not taxed as part of the gift. If $100 is assumed to grow, at 1.4%, to $102.82 in two years, any increase in value in excess of $102.82 escapes the gift tax calculation.  It is easy to understand why Treasury dislikes GRATs; however, the irony is that GRATs are creatures of regulation drafted by Treasury.

If a grantor dies during the initial term, the property in the GRAT is restored to the estate of the grantor.  The Treasury proposal would require that GRATs have a minimum term of ten years.  The proposal would increase the likelihood of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate taxation</a> of GRATs and minimize the effectiveness of the technique.

A rolling GRAT is a technique whereby the annuity received by the grantor from the GRAT is re-contributed to a new GRAT. Rolling GRATs are designed to reduce the size of one’s estate by not retaining the annuity payments received each year.

In August, the §7520 rate is projected to increase to 2.0% from 1.4% thereby making it a bit more costly to transfer wealth. A Shelf GRAT is created to lock in the use of the lower interest rate for use in future years. The technique requires a more detailed explanation than I can provide here; however, taxpayers planning for the future should act now before Treasury’s proposals are implemented.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Rashia Wilson, the self-proclaimed tax fraud "queen" who taunted her crimes to authorities via social media, has been sentenced by a district court to 21 years in federal prison for her various tax law violations.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/self-proclaimed-tax-fraud-queen-sentenced-to-21-years-in-prison" rel="attachment wp-att-3129"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3129" alt="Tax Fraud" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tax_Fraud-300x106.jpg" width="300" height="106" /></a>U.S. District Judge James Moody handed down the sentence - which is the most severe ruling given so far in the stolen identity tax refund fraud outbreak that has overtaken Tampa, Florida - following Wilson's online taunts that federal authorities could never catch her.

Wilson used part of the funds she stole to throw a $30,000 party for her 1-year-old daughter, and also purchased a new vehicle, allegedly telling the salesman that she "didn't care what type of car it was, as long as it was the most expensive on the lot," according to the Tampa Tribune.

Her representatives argued that their client, who stole as much as $20 million from U.S. taxpayers through the use of identity theft and wire fraud, was suffering from a mental illness at the time. Despite her apologies to the courtroom, Wilson's Facebook messages were a large contributor to the high sentence she received.

"I'm Rashia, the queen of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">IRS tax fraud</a>," her <a href="/facebook-irs-tax-law/">Facebook</a> post stated, all in capital letters. "I'm a millionaire for the record, so if U think indicting me will B easy it won't, I promise you! U need more than black and white to hold me down N that's to da rat who went N told, as if 1st lady don't have da TPD under her spell. I run Tampa right now."

Judge Moody wrote that despite Wilson's tearful remorse, she knew what she was doing was wrong and "reveled in the fact that it was wrong."

In addition to serving her time in prison, Wilson will also be required to pay restitution for the millions she stole from the government.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">gift tax law</a> is a popular strategy used by individuals and business owners of all income levels to reduce their taxable estate and pass on wealth, property, and assets to future generations. While most people may know the basics of the gift tax law, many may not be aware of the fine details that may impact their tax and<a href="/dont-leave-gift-taxes-out-of-estate-planning/"> estate planning</a> decisions.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law" rel="attachment wp-att-3137"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3137" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Gift_tax_law-300x178.jpg" alt="Gift tax law" width="300" height="178" /></a>In a recent Wall Street Journal column, an individual wrote in expressing confusion over the limitations and exclusions associated with the gift tax law. One of the most common misperceptions about the rule is that the gift tax exclusion only applies when gifts are passed down to children or spouses. In actuality, the Internal Revenue Service allows a person to extend gifts of up to $14,000 to whomever they wish in 2013. This number doubles to $28,000 for married couples filing jointly. This means that a person or couple may extend gifts up to that limit to children, siblings, neighbors, friends, parents, or even strangers without facing tax liabilities. Further, individuals may give these gifts up to as many people as they wish. Typically, gifts given between spouses are tax-free.

In addition, there are a number of gifts that are excluded from the annual limit. For instance, a person may pay for the medical expenses or school tuition of anyone they wish without coming under the limitations of the gift tax law. This means that parents who pay for the tuition of their children - even if the amount exceeds $28,000 - will not be required to pay taxes on any funds that exceed the annual threshold.

Understanding these details can help parents, business owners and individuals make more informed decisions about how to extend financing or gifts to loved ones and help ensure that they don't face any tax surprises in the future.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In a recent article in Wealth Management, the author David de Jong and Robert Lafranco describe the difficulty billionaires face in providing a safe haven to shield assets.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/the-plight-of-billionaires-looking-for-new-havens-to-shield-assets" rel="attachment wp-att-3143"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3143" alt="Shield Assets" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Shield_Assets-300x263.jpg" width="256" height="225" /></a>For example, they point out the troubles of Dimitry Rybolovelev who is Russia’s 14th richest person and is embroiled in a multi-jurisdiction divorce action with his wife. The lawsuits provide a window into the offshore structures and secrecy jurisdictions that billionaires use to manage, preserve or conceal their assets. A desirable offshore jurisdiction has several characteristics. In the past, bank secrecy, nominee shareholders or bearer shares and no annual reporting were of primary importance in the selection process. Other desirable features include: (1) a low or no <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">income tax</a>; (2) taxing income earned within its borders; (3) a stable political environment; (4) adherence to the rule of law; (5) a strong banking sector; (6) access to income <a href="/overriding-tax-treaties-an-inside-look/">tax treaties</a> if needed for business and investment; (7), little or no wealth (transfer) taxes; (8) and a flexible roster of entities, such as trusts, foundations, corporations, companies and partnerships.

At the end of 2010, the Tax Justice Network (TJN) reported wealthy individuals were hiding as much as $32 trillion dollars offshore. TJN states its purpose to promote transparency in finance opposes secrecy and seeks progressive taxation. Thirty percent of the world’s 200 richest people control $2.8 trillion dollars. Much of the control is done through offshore holding companies or other domestic entities where assets are held indirectly. Depending on one’s perspective, these structures either remove or hide assets from tax authorities and provide legal protection from government seizures and private lawsuits. The counter argument is that these structures permit capital to flow more freely, reduces taxation and increases profitability, and provides commercial access to <a href="/treasury-department-works-with-more-than-50-jurisdictions-to-stem-tax-evasion/">stable jurisdictions</a>.

Since 2001 and more particularly since the global financial crises in 2008, many of the international tax treaties have been revised to allow for exchange of information and elimination of bank secrecy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a body made up of 34 developed countries, has been the primary force behind the exchange of information and the elimination of secrecy. Some cite the scandals involving ENRON and Parmalat, w which used offshore and off-balance sheet structures as catalysts.

Singapore will make laundering of profits from <a href="/irs-includes-tax-evasion-and-misuse-of-trusts-in-list-of-dirty-dozen-tax-scams/">tax evasion</a> a crime under a law scheduled to take effect July 1st of this year. Luxemburg announced on April 10th that it would end its bank secrecy policy in 2015. Cyprus, which was bailed out of financial troubles in March by the European Union, was required to impose a tax on bank deposits of more than €100,000. In that month, the country lost $2.4 billion dollars in deposits.
Because of this shift towards financial transparency, many of the world’s wealthiest seek new havens to place their wealth. Some of these include Liechtenstein, the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and the British Virgin Islands.
Many Russian billionaires create entities in the British Virgin Islands because they find the legal system more attractive than in their own country.

Many of today’s wealthy focus on finding places to minimize their taxes and avoid double taxation. These include Lika-Shing and Lee Shaukee, Asia’s two richest men; Alisher Usmanov, Russia’s richest man; U.S. Energy billionaire George Kaiser; and Paolo Rocca, an Italian billionaire in a continuing “cat and mouse” game with the Argentine government.

As more and more jurisdictions yield to the ever present pressure to remove bank secrecy laws and to provide for transparency in financial systems, global billionaires will have more and more difficultly finding a home for their money.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many companies, especially small businesses, prefer to use a reputable third-party firm for the task of outsourcing payroll. While this trend may free up more time and energy for business owners to focus on their operations, it can also create stress over <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">tax compliance</a></span> if owners do not take the proper steps to ensure their responsibilities are being carried out.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/use-best-practices-when-outsourcing-payroll" rel="attachment wp-att-3152"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3152" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/outsourcing_payroll-300x228.jpg" alt="outsourcing payroll" width="245" height="185" /></a>There have been a number of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/lawmakers-encourage-irs-to-focus-attention-on-payroll-services-fraud/">payroll fraud</a> </span>cases lately in which third-party providers fail to carry out their obligations to the company - such as collecting and depositing payroll taxes on the employer's behalf and filing required payroll tax returns with state and federal authorities - thereby leaving the business facing federal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax liabilities</a>.</span> Whether the business itself faces sole liability or shares it with the third-party firm will vary by circumstance, but the process of correcting these errors can still be costly and tedious. Therefore, it's important to implement a few safeguards to ensure compliance with federal laws.

For example, the IRS reports that companies that enroll in the government's Electronic Federal Tax Payment System and require third-party providers to make deposits through this system can better monitor their accounts and ensure compliance. The portal enables employers to view their payment history, which can help them detect errors or mistakes on the part of the third party.

The IRS recommends that employers also continue using their address as the primary point of contact with the tax agency, rather than substituting it with the third party's address. The IRS does allow businesses to list the payroll provider's address on file and have correspondence sent to them. However, by ensuring that all correspondence is sent directly to employers, they can ensure that they receive all bills, notices and information from the IRS.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The United States Supreme Court recently struck down the Defense of Marriage Act <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(<a href="/doma-ruling-may-have-estate-tax-planning-implications/">DOMA</a></span>) as unconstitutional. Despite this ruling, there are a number of issues that will result from this decision where the laws of the states will differ.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/what-happens-now-the-aftermath-of-doma-defense-of-marriage-act" rel="attachment wp-att-3173"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3173" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/defense_marriage_act-300x175.jpg" alt="defense marriage act" width="266" height="175" /></a>Consider a gay couple, A and B, with a valid marriage under the law of the state where they reside (the “Home State”). Assume that this couple owns property in a state (“non-resident state”) that does not recognize gay marriage. What are the implications? I pose a number of questions that are sure to arise.

Assume the property in the Non-resident State is income producing property. May this couple file a non-resident income tax return as married or must they file separate returns?

Wha<span style="text-decoration: underline;">t <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">income tax rate</a> </span>or table may this couple use? May they use married or must they file separately and under what status?

Assume there is a judgment rendered in the non-resident state against A. Is B, a non-debtor, able to protect his or her property interest from the levy of  A’s creditor?  May the entire property interest, that of A and B, be protected in the same manner as in the case of ownership by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety?

Assume A has a qualified retirement plan account (401K) but does not name anyone as beneficiary. Do the default rules operate to pass the retirement account to B, the survivor?

Assume the non-resident state does not recognize gay marriage and has an inheritance tax that imposes a tax based upon the relationship of the recipient, B, to the decedent, A. What is the tax classification of the B? If New Jersey did not recognize B as the spouse of A, inheritance tax would be imposed at 15%.

Is a state law Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) drawn on the Home State effective against a custodian in the non-resident state that does not recognize gay marriage?

Assume an estate tax return must be filed in the Non-resident State. How do you compute the marital deduction for state law purposes if B is not considered a spouse in the non-resident state?

These are some of the issues that will arise in the coming years. The Supreme Court’s  decision resolves only the question before it. The decision does not address the collateral consequences. Although planning could address these issues, I am certain that case law, confusion and controversy are ahead.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">Tax law</a></span> violations are typically a crime that most people hear about in domestic news, but tax evasion and fraud appear to be an increasingly global phenomenon. As more individuals take advantage of favorable regulations and tax benefits in offshore accounts and foreign financial institutions, the ability to commit tax evasion has become more accessible. In response, countries are now joining forces for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/global-tax-evasion-compliance-deadline-nears/">global tax evasion</a></span> reduction, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently announced initiatives to play its part in this goal.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/oecd-announces-plan-for-tax-evasion-reduction" rel="attachment wp-att-3186"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3186" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tax_evasion_reduction-254x300.jpg" alt="tax evasion reduction" width="242" height="286" /></a>The global agency noted that by devising a new, simplified, yet comprehensive, strategy that governs the ways in which countries share information about individuals, businesses, and trusts, they can better monitor financial transactions and detect potential violations.

The OECD suggested that by moving to a standard way of sharing information, rather than relying on fragmented agreements, countries would be in a better position to stay on top of these transactions, according to Reuters. In addition, the agency said that a standardized method would be more efficient in detecting violations as opposed to the current method of launching an investigation and requesting account data from another country.

The United States currently faces a tax gap of roughly $385 billion each year, while the European Union said that it has lost hundreds of billions in unaccounted taxes due to evasion. While some believe that these coordinated methods will help close these tax gaps, others argue that there is little legal authority behind the well-meaning international efforts. A separate article that appeared in Reuters noted that the agreements discussed would be largely diplomatic, but lack the legal backbone and authority needed to carry out such as large-scale initiative.

The OECD plans to unveil its new draft agreement in 2013, which will detail the types of information that can be exchanged and proposals for common legal and technological standards, Reuters reports.]]></content>

Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York state tax department will begin issuing refund checks to the surviving spouses of gay marriages who had to pay <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate taxes</a> </span>on money or property they inherited from partners because federal law did not recognize their marriages. The refunds may go as far back as 2008. Prior to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/doma-ruling-may-have-estate-tax-planning-implications/">DOMA ruling</a>,</span> heterosexual spouses were not subject to estate taxes, while same-sex couples often incurred bills amounting to thousands of dollars. The court's ruling that DOMA is unconstitutional paved the way for all married couples in states that recognize same-sex marriage to be treated equally under the U.S. Tax Code.

New York legalized gay marriage in 2011, and one month after the law was finalized, the state department extended equal rights under the estate tax law to legally married same-sex couples, including to those who married in other states before New York legalized same-sex marriage. However, federal law prevented the state from extending the rights retroactively until the Supreme Court's recent ruling.

"As a result of [the Supreme Court] decision, New York State is now able to issue refund checks to qualified same-sex spouses who were required to pay taxes for no reason other than their sexual orientation," Cuomo said in his announcement.

When asked to provide an estimate for how much money would be refunded, Gov. Cuomo was unable to provide an exact figure, but noted that his administration did not believe it would have a detrimental impact on the state's budget.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit filed a decision in <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capato</span> v.</i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commissioner Social Security</span></i>, on July 24, 2013, that highlights the need for a legislative solution in providing benefits under federal programs. <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/fatherless-child-law-struggles-to-catch-up-to-reproductive-technology" rel="attachment wp-att-3212"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3212" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/reproductive_technology.jpg" alt="reproductive technology" width="256" height="131" /></a>The Court held that twins, conceived after the death of their biological father through assisted reproductive technology, were not entitled to Social Security benefits.

The Court reversed a previous ruling in this matter. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/farmers-ranchers-lobby-for-better-estate-gift-tax-legislation/">Social Security legislation</a> </span>enacted in 1939 provided for survivor’s benefits for children of wage earners. The hot-button issue at that time was children born out of wedlock. In the 1960s, children of unwed parents were extended social security benefits survivor’s benefits. The test used to determine if the children were eligible for benefits was whether the children would qualify as heirs of the deceased parent under the laws of the state where the decedent was domiciled at the time of his or her death.

Fast forward to 2013, and a test created in the 1960s operates in an unanticipated manner. In the instant case, the Court ruled that the decedent-father was domiciled in Florida, where state law provides that a child conceived from eggs or sperm of a person or persons who died before the transfer of eggs, sperm or pre-embryos to a woman’s body shall not be eligible for a claim against the decedent’s estate unless the child has been provided for by the decedent’s will. Fla. Stat. Ann §742.17(4). The result might have been different if the decedent-father died in another state. If the twins were born within 300 days of the decedent’s death, New Jersey law would presume the decedent-husband was the father.

N.J.S.A. §9:17-43. There is an issue of fairness where two families, with virtually identical facts, could receive a different outcome for purposes of a federal benefits program because of the differences of law in their respective states of residence. Consider the possibility that the class of heirs may never close if eggs and sperm remain available indefinitely to assisted reproductive technology.  Imagine the impact upon the Rule Against Perpetuities, the Generation Skipping Transfer Tax, or<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate probate and inheritance</a>.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As the Internal Revenue Service attempts to close the multibillion-dollar tax gap, a large portion of its resources are being geared to combat tax fraud involving sizable assets. This includes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/the-plight-of-billionaires-looking-for-new-havens-to-shield-assets/">offshore tax havens</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/oecd-announces-plan-for-tax-evasion-reduction/">tax evasion</a>,</span> and, as of late, unpaid or incorrectly calculated estate taxes. However, recent crimes relating to sophisticated identity theft rings have also bilked the government out of millions of dollars, and federal and state agencies are now implementing several new types of web software to combat these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a>.</span>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/u-s-state-governments-rely-on-new-software-to-combat-tax-fraud" rel="attachment wp-att-3221"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3221" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/combat_tax_evasion-300x196.jpg" alt="combat tax evasion" width="259" height="168" /></a>The IRS will rely upon a combination of complex software from several different providers to ensure that tax returns are legitimate, the Wall Street Journal reports. The business software providers that will assist the IRS in accomplishing these goals include SAS Institute, LexisNexis Group, and International Business Machines (IBM). The various software types work in different ways that complement each other and provide a more accurate and comprehensive tax infrastructure than any stand-alone methods. For example, the SAS software uses publicly available data to verify a person's identity instantly, the Journal explains.

LexisNexis compares all tax-filing information against a database of personal information that the company has been collecting since the 1990s. As an example, the Journal explained that if a state receives a tax return from a person who claims to be employed in one state or have a certain number of children, but the LexisNexis database shows different information, the return will be flagged and individuals may be required to provide proof of their identity.

The IBM software works by "predicting" criminal activity based on individuals' relationships and actions, but the firm failed to elaborate on how the system specifically works.

Like many other government agencies, the IRS has been burdened by budget cuts. However, the agency is attempting to find more creative ways to combat tax crimes through technology and international agreements.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Trustees had been governed by the Reasonable Man standard for investing trust assets that were designed to preserve principal and avoid risk.  Then, Modern Portfolio Theory came into prominence and the Reasonable Man rule fell into disfavor. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), supported by the work of Nobel Laureates, became the prevailing theory. In the most simple of terms, MPT requires diversification by allocating capital among asset classes or sectors so as to minimize risk.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/uniform-acts-modern-portfolio-theory-and-an-unintended-consequence" rel="attachment wp-att-3237"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3237" alt="modern portfolio theory" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/modern_portfolio_theory-300x190.jpg" width="265" height="168" /></a>The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) incorporates MPT that requires trustees to diversify investment portfolios.  Diversification is achieved through statistical methods that are designed to minimize investment risk, through the selection of securities that respond differently to market changes. MPT notes that some stocks react, up or down, in lockstep with the market index. Defensive stocks, such as utilities, do not decline as rapidly in bad markets and do not rise as rapidly as the market in good times as the index. A diversified mix of stocks among unrelated sectors minimizes the overall risk of loss to the trust assets. MPT believes that risk can be minimized for any targeted level of returns.

The rule of UPIA can be overridden by the Trustee. A Grantor may leave a closely-held business in a trust and therefore must allow for the holding of a concentrated position by the trust. Not every successful investor uses MPT. Warren Buffet distains MPT and at one time had one-third of his portfolio in the stock of Coca Cola.

The Uniform Trust Code (UTC) is a comprehensive statute designed to improve state trust law.  UTC Section 404 demands the trust “benefit the beneficiaries,” a rule that can cause conflict with a Grantor’s instructions to the Trustee. Imagine a trustee, bound by the instructions of the Grantor who waived the application of MPT as permitted by UPIA, and now faces a challenge based upon the UTC.  The problem is that the UTC gives beneficiaries a reasonable basis to mount a challenge that will overturn the Grantor’s instructions to the Trustee.  The beneficiaries may claim that the trust, as administered, does not meet their needs, disregarding what is written in the trust instrument. The beneficiaries may also claim the Grantor’s instructions to the Trustee represents control from the grave that prevents the trust from adapting to current circumstances and being administered for their benefit.  Not every potential conflict is be resolved by uniform legislation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many affluent Americans and business owners breathed a sigh of relief when lawmakers prevented the federal estate tax exemption from reverting back to $1 million at the beginning of the year. Instead, Americans can exempt an indexed $5.25 million from federal estate taxes or $10.5 million for those who are married and file joint returns. However, another popular aspect of the tax law put in place by lawmakers is what is known as the estate tax portability provision.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/understanding-the-estate-tax-portability-provision" rel="attachment wp-att-3246"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3246" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/estate_tax_portability_provision-199x300.jpg" alt="estate tax portability provision" width="165" height="250" /></a>This addition allows individuals to potentially double their federal estate-tax exemption. The law allows for the transfer of the federal estate-tax exemption from the estate of the first spouse to pass away to the estate of the second spouse. This means that if a husband passes away, leaving his spouse $5.25 million, this amount may be transferred and then combined with the surviving widow's own $5.25 million exemption. This would allow the surviving spouse to pass on $10.5 million upon his or her death to beneficiaries and loved ones.

During this type of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning/">estate tax planning</a></span> however, it's important for spouses who want to take advantage of this provision to understand the correct guidelines and protocols around it. For example, in order to claim this opportunity, surviving spouses must file IRS Form 706 within nine months of the spouse passing away, a recent MarketWatch report reminded readers. As the months following the death of a spouse can be wrought with emotion, grief and a significant amount of legal complexities, widows may apply for a six-month extension by filing Form 4768 to give them more time.

Because many Americans may be unfamiliar with this provision and the rules surrounding it, it's important to work with a well-reputed<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax attorney</a> </span>to gain more knowledge of these laws and timelines. Doing so can help couples avoid costly mistakes and lost opportunities related to estate planning.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In another example of international cooperation to quell Norwegian<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/global-tax-evasion-compliance-deadline-nears/">tax evasion</a>,</span> a quiet investigation is expected to reveal the identities of Norwegian taxpayers with secret U.S. bank accounts and of residents of Norway who should be, but aren't, paying taxes there.

F<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/six-u-s-states-involved-in-norwegian-tax-evasion-case" rel="attachment wp-att-3256"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3256" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/norwegian-tax-evasion-300x180.jpg" alt="norwegian tax evasion" width="281" height="168" /></a>ederal courts in six U.S. states have granted the Internal Revenue Service permission to serve "John Doe" summonses on U.S. banks that are digging for information about unknown individuals who have used certain credit or debit cards in Norway. A "John Doe" summons is typically used when the IRS seeks information about possible tax fraud committed by individuals whose identities are not known.

Courts in Minnesota, Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Virginia, and California authorized the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">IRS</a></span> to get involved in the cases at the request of the Norwegian government, which recently said it has noticed unknown individuals using credit or debit cards in their country. However, the country said it is unclear as to whether these citizens are complying with Norway's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">strict tax laws</a></span>, which require that account holders report account information or income on their Norwegian tax returns. Similar court requests are also pending in Mississippi and New Hampshire, Reuters reports.

Approximately 18 financial institutions are involved in the case, including Bank of America, Citibank, PNC Bank, Wells Fargo, and Capital One. The banks may be required to provide information and bank records to U.S. authorities to help them flush out potential tax cheats on Norway's behalf. More specifically, banks may be asked to hand over documents relating to bank account applications, signature cards and other records that tied to one or a few specific payment or credit card numbers that have been used over a period of years for ATM withdrawals and other transactions in Norway. Officials will examine the transactions which require a PIN, but don't require the card holder's name, Forbes reports.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Rhode Island Governor Chafee issued an executive order directing the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state. The executive order does not, however, permit same sex divorce.  Society is in a state of limbo where executive orders can address some, but not all, of the issues.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/rhode-island-same-sex-divorce-and-portability-imperfect-together" rel="attachment wp-att-3265"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3265" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/same-sex-divorce-242x300.jpg" alt="same sex divorce" width="220" height="272" /></a>How does one address the use of the Federal Estate Tax Exemption, currently $5,250,000, for same-sex couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage? If A and B marry in a state that  permits same-sex marriages and then move to a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage, are they married for state death tax purposes?  Typically, a couple must be married under state law before they are eligible for the marital deduction. Whether they are married is of critical importance for federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a> </span>purposes where marital deduction, the $5,250,000 Exemption and the portability of the Deceased Spouse Unused Exclusion Amount (“DSUEA”) are the pillars of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/doma-ruling-may-have-estate-tax-planning-implications/">estate planning</a></span>.  Portability is where the surviving spouse adds the exemption of the first-to-die to his or her own.  In states that have an estate tax that follows federal law, there may be new impediments that prevent consistency.

Consider the same-sex marriage of A and B where A dies and B survives. If the marriage of A and B is not recognized by the state of residence, what is the Deceased Spouse Unused Exclusion Amount (“DSUEA”)?  Is B entitled to use A’s exemption or is it lost if not used?

Assume that B survives A and then remarries C.  In theory, B should lose the DSUEA from A because B has remarried and the couple of A and C are therefore only entitled to the DSUEA of either A or C. This is the rule that applies to traditional couples.

If the state recognizes the same-sex marriage, then B should be entitled to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/understanding-the-estate-tax-portability-provision/">estate tax portability</a> </span>of A’s DSUEA. Suppose the state where A and B reside does not recognize their marriage. We could, conceivably, file a federal estate tax return on A’s death and elect portability. B, however, would not be able to elect portability on the state level, so B may be forced to use A’s exemption instead.  Is it possible, where a state follows the federal estate tax rules, to file completely different returns because of this disconnect?]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A large number of small, mid-market, and large companies nationwide are failing to comply with the Internal Revenue Service rules that govern worker classification status, a new report reveals.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/report-companies-failing-at-worker-classification" rel="attachment wp-att-3270"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3270" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/worker-classification-300x300.jpg" alt="worker classification" width="235" height="235" /></a>The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, looking to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">ensure tax compliance</a>,</span> released new findings that show many companies who continue to misclassify employees as independent contractors. This malpractice then leaves them open to audits, penalties, and fines. The agency came to this conclusion after investigating an SS-8 program, which allows workers and employers to request a determination letter from the IRS saying whether a worker should be classified as an employee or independent contractor.

After examining more than 5,300 cases in which the IRS deemed a worker to be an employee, the agency found that only 17 percent of employers "appeared to comply with the ruling and issued one or more W-2 forms to their workers during tax years 2008 through 2010."

In addition, 19 percent "appeared not to have complied with the determinations and issued a form 1099-MISC instead of a form W-2 to their workers for tax year 2008, 2009, and/or 2010." Meanwhile, 65 percent did not issue a form 1099-MISC or W-2 to their workers, meaning that these workers were either no longer employed by the company or may have been paid under the table.

There are several reasons for which companies may want to classify employees as independent contractors. Under the contractor status, employers are not required to provide benefits coverage or withhold income. Further, companies are shielded from paying worker's compensation coverage as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/struggling-to-meet-business-costs-dont-neglect-payroll-taxes/">payroll taxes</a>.</span>

However, employers who misclassify workers as contractors to save money may face steep penalties for doing so. In addition to suffering reputational damage, these<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations</a></span> may also levy penalties and interest and the payment of back taxes owed to the IRS. Finally, companies may be forced to reimburse workers for wages that should have been paid under the Fair Labor Standards Act, including overtime and minimum wages, and benefits afforded regular employees.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The lack of liquidity is a serious problem in the administration of an Estate, especially for a fiduciary with the potential for personal liability. The lack of liquidity can arise from no planning, illiquid assets or an unforeseen change in circumstances or market conditions. Federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a></span> is due nine months after death; however, it may not be possible to sell assets within that period. The dramatic decline in market values after death or the valuation date creates severe problems as seen below.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-of-turco-is-there-clawback-for-insufficient-estate-tax-funds" rel="attachment wp-att-3277"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3277" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/estate-of-turco.jpg" alt="estate of turco" width="211" height="271" /></a>The New Jersey case, <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estate of Turco</span></i>, illustrates how adverse market conditions can harm an estate. The decedent died in March 2005 (or six months later with alternate valuation) and the appraisals of the estate produced a $30,000,000 gross estate for federal tax purposes. You may recall the tightening of the credit markets in 2007, followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The estate is obligated to pay an estate tax calculated on asset values that could not be realized in the current marketplace.

There are two other important facts to note. First, there was $4.5m of life insurance that was paid to trusts for the decedent’s grandchildren, who were designated as the primary beneficiaries of the proceeds. Second, the Will required that all taxes were to be paid from the residuary estate.

The court declared the estate insolvent at the administrator’s request. The administrator requested that he be authorized to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/clawback-undue-influence-and-isolation-an-upcoming-preview-of-litigation-in-the-matter-of-the-estate-of-clark/">clawback</a></span> funds from the non-probate assets and specific bequests. The Court held that it was too soon to consider clawback and instructed the administrator to seek a compromise with the IRS before requesting such authority.

The court’s opinion noted that the administrator did not have the statutory power under federal or state law to recover taxes from non-probate assets, especially where there is a specific clause in the Will instructing on the source of funds for payment of taxes.

The nightmare for advisors is the rapid decline in asset values without the corresponding liquidity. One must remember the grandchildren’s trust received life insurance proceeds which are non-probate assets. Clearly the grandchildren are better off having been named as primary beneficiaries of the policies and receiving the proceeds directly rather than through the estate.  This group also benefits from the absence of statutory authority that would permit the fiduciary from pursuing non-probate assets.

Whether the IRS will refuse to compromise the tax bill and whether it will push the administrator to clawback funds from the trusts will be the next installment.  The government has its own statutory authority to collect taxes from transferees, which the court did not address.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In light of a recent government report that shed light on the prevalence of incorrect<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/report-companies-failing-at-worker-classification/">worker classification</a>,</span> many companies are coming under fire for their own labor practices. However, some industries are facing more scrutiny than others, particularly the oil and gas industries, a new report reveals.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/oil-gas-industry-faces-scrutiny-for-labor-practices" rel="attachment wp-att-3286"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3286" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/labor-practices.jpg" alt="labor practices" width="268" height="211" /></a>The Pittsburg Post-Gazette reports that the U.S. Department of Labor has been focusing more attention on oil and gas companies, citing historic patterns of labor and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law violations</a></span> as the primary reason for its focus on these sectors. The agency notes that many companies operating in these sectors have demonstrated a history of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/new-laws-clamp-down-on-employee-misclassifications/">employee misclassifications</a></span>, failing to keep viable employment records, and paying employees a day rate without calculating how many hours are worked in a week, the newspaper reports.

In addition, some companies may assume that simply having a contract with workers in which they classify themselves as independent contractors may protect them during an audit or investigation. However, this is not always the case as federal agencies will rely upon the IRS and Labor Department definitions of a contractor, rather than a formal contract signed between workers and employers, the Post-Gazette notes.

Further, many states currently participate in an information-sharing agreement between the Labor Department and the Internal Revenue Service. This means that if companies are audited or cited for violations from one agency, it is also likely that they may soon hear from the other. This can lead to a number of consequences, including fines, penalties, interest, back taxes, and reputational damage. As such, it's important that companies fully understand how their tax and labor policies fall in line with federal laws, and make potential changes if there are compliance questions. Working with a reputable law firm may help companies better understand their obligations under these laws and establish policies that are sound.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/are-bitcoins-taxable-uncertainty-persists/">Bitcoins</a>,</span> a controversial but highly popular global digital currency, is being used by more consumers to make several types of transactions. Although no government has recognized the bitcoin as a legitimate currency or placed concrete value on its use, the anonymity afforded to bitcoin users, coupled with the growing trend of bartering them for assets that carry value, has drawn attention to the currency as a potential tax evasion tool.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/will-the-bitcoin-become-a-new-tax-evasion-tool/tax-evasion-tool/" rel="attachment wp-att-3294"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3294" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-evasion-tool.jpg" alt="tax evasion tool" width="276" height="225" /></a>A recent Yahoo analysis noted that "money" is not necessarily defined by production or recognition and distribution by a government agency. Instead, the article argued that money is typically defined as any tool that can enable financial transactions. Under this expanded definition, the ubiquitous bitcoin may qualify, namely because it has and continues to be used to transact real property, foreign currencies, barter, and financial instruments. Whether this argument will hold up in a legal atmosphere is still undetermined, but federal authorities - including the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-to-hammer-down-on-bitcoins-virtual-currency/">Internal Revenue Service</a></span> - are weighing these arguments carefully.

Because bitcoins may be used to facilitate financial transactions, the IRS in particular is focusing on the currency and where it falls in line with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">federal tax laws</a>.</span> Forbes recently analyzed the use of bitcoins as a potential tax evasion tool, noting that anonymity is one of the key issues that may make avoiding taxes possible for users. In addition, the IRS relies heavily upon financial institutions and foreign governments to report details of account holders for tax purposes. As bitcoins are not recognized as a legitimate currency, users do not have to rely on financial intermediaries to move them or make transactions.

Further, there are several legal questions that remain. For example, if consumers exchange bitcoins for cash, the question of whether there is a "gain" may depend largely on whether bitcoins are viewed as a currency or commodity, Forbes explained. Until these questions are answered, speculation of whether the digital currency will emerge as a tool to avoid taxes - and how this issued will be resolved - may continue to grow.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Today, an increasing number of children are born with assistance of advanced <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/fatherless-child-law-struggles-to-catch-up-to-reproductive-technology/">reproductive technology</a></span>. Such children may be conceived and born years after the death of a parent.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/the-birds-and-the-bees-for-trustees" rel="attachment wp-att-3305"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3305" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/trustees1-300x263.jpg" alt="trustees" width="241" height="210" /></a>A typical trust has a current beneficiary who receives distributions of income and principal. The issue of the current beneficiary (child) will receive the distributions upon the child’s death. If there are no issues, the interest may pass to the child’s siblings or the issue of the siblings. What happens if a child of assisted reproduction is born years after the death of the current beneficiary?

Children of assisted reproduction may result from various combinations of sperm source, egg source, birth mother and parental relationship. A common example is the posthumous child conceived by the wife using the sperm of her deceased husband. Few would argue that the child is a child of the mother. Some may question if the donor consented to a posthumous child; however, most observers would infer consent from the deposit of sperm in a clinic prior to death. How does one evaluate consent where the extraction of sperm occurs after death of the donor?

How does a trustee evaluate the circumstances of a childless couple that uses reproductive technology to conceive a child. If the sperm and egg are from the husband and wife and in vitro fertilization occurs, one would expect the child would be a child of these parents. What if the sperm, the egg or both were donated by third parties? Clearly, the intent of the husband and wife to treat the child as their own should control. What if the husband did not want a child and the wife is impregnated with the sperm of an unrelated donor? Should the trustee recognize the child if the wife is an in-law or should the trustee assume the child is of the marriage?

To properly administer a trust, the class of persons who will succeed to the income and principal distributions must be determined. In trust parlance, the class of beneficiaries must close. If assisted reproduction can occur years after the death of the child, it may be difficult to close the class and effectively administer the trust.

Most parents and grandparents would include an adopted child as part of the class of beneficiaries. Parents and grandparents should ask themselves whether they intend to limit successors to issue having genetic material from blood-relatives. The treatment of same-sex couples should also be considered as it is possible that one or more of these relationships may be encountered in the future. Finally, if there is to be a further division into shares upon the death of a beneficiary, how long must a trustee wait until closing the class of beneficiaries.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos turned some heads when the billionaire decided to purchase the Washington Post for a reported $250 million. While it remains to be seen what direction Bezos will take the newspaper, one thing some experts agree on is that he will need to utilize a hands-on approach with it to make it a viable business once again and reap major tax benefits.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/bezos-may-have-trouble-securing-tax-benefits-with-wapo" rel="attachment wp-att-3310"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3310" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-benefits-300x296.jpg" alt="tax benefits" width="252" height="248" /></a>After the announcement, Bezos noted he plans to remain in Seattle, where he continues to oversee many aspects of his online retail giant, meaning he personally won't be working on restructuring WaPo on a day-to-day basis. This, experts told the source, is why<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2013/08/07/report-tax-rules-could-force-bezos-to-play-active-role-at-wash-post/" target="_blank">tax benefits may elude Bezos</a>.</span>

Congress has passed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span> measures in recent years to ensure that business owners won't be able to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/will-starbucks-succeed-in-securing-new-u-s-tax-breaks/" target="_blank">secure tax breaks</a></span> for companies they don't oversee the operations of on a regular basis. Thus, it may behoove Bezos to rethink his position on how he plans to run The Post in the future.

"A lot of it depends on how you count hours ... It's a fair amount of time you have to spend, it's not inconsequential," said CBIZ MHM Managing Director Bill Smith told the news source.

Citing tax rules per the Internal Revenue Service, other tax experts relayed to Reuters that Bezos would likely have to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 hours per year overseeing the newspaper to obtain tax credits.

It's reported that Bezos, who owns 19 percent of Amazon, is worth roughly $25 billion. Another major business venture he's taken on in recent years is space travel. In 2000, shortly after Amazon took off, he founded Blue Origin, a spaceflight company that is working on technologies that would allow private citizens to travel to space.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Tax Court recently ruled against the John Hancock Life Insurance Co. in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/pohlad-estate-brings-lawsuit-against-irs-over-189-million-tax-bill-regarding-minnesota-twins/">tax lawsuit</a></span> involving hundreds of millions in deductions, Bloomberg News reports.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/john-hancock-loses-560-million-tax-lawsuit" rel="attachment wp-att-3315"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3315" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-lawsuit.jpg" alt="tax lawsuit" width="255" height="112" /></a>The court opposed John Hancock's argument that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/failing-to-complete-taxes-properly-cost-entrepreneur-18-5-million-in-tax-deductions/">tax deductions</a></span> on a series of leveraged lease transactions - including depreciation, rental and interest expense, and transaction costs - amounting to $560 million were valid. The issue involves the insurance company's use of lease-in-lease-out and sale-in-lease-out transactions - notably referred to as LILO and SILO. These transactions occur when companies purchase sizable assets, which are then leased to third parties for use. Most companies then adopted the practice of claiming deductions on the assets, Bloomberg notes.

Since 2008, however, the IRS has determined that these types of transactions are vehicles for improper tax avoidance. The agency claims that firms cannot legally claim deductions under federal law because they never actually owned the assets. After giving companies a chance to terminate LILOs and SILOs in exchange for 20 percent of the savings, the IRS has won a series of cases relating to these vehicles.

In John Hancock's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax case</a></span>, the IRS argued that the transactions "lacked economic substance and the substance of the transactions is not consistent with their form." U.S. Judge Harry Haines agreed with the federal agency on the latter half of the argument, according to his court opinion.

"John Hancock did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership" wrote Judge Harry Haines.

However, he did not directly address the economic substance argument, which may give the company some room to appeal the decision. In an emailed statement, John Hancock alluded to the possibility of appealing the ruling.

"We continue to believe our position on the tax treatment of our lease investments was appropriate and factually distinguishable from other recent cases addressing the tax treatment of leverage lease investments," wrote Roy Anderson, a spokesman for Bloomberg.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Lawmakers' decision to both set the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a></span> at $5.25 million for 2013 and increase the annual <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/gift-tax-myths-and-misunderstandings-2/">gift tax</a></span> to $14,000 has been a welcomed sigh of relief for many affluent individuals and business owners. The gift tax, in particular, has historically been a key strategy Americans have used to transfer wealth to future generations and lower their taxable estate or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/estate-executors-may-carry-personal-tax-liability/">tax liability</a>.</span>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/spouses-should-be-aware-of-gift-splitting-criteria-when-gifting-assets" rel="attachment wp-att-3330"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3330" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gifting-assets-300x286.jpg" alt="gifting assets" width="267" height="253" /></a>Couples who file jointly have the added advantage of doubling the amount they can gift to individuals at a tax-free rate, enabling them to extend $28,000 in cash or assets to loved ones. However, when one spouse chooses to extend a gift to another person, a scenario known as "gift-splitting" should be discussed to help them avoid federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/dont-leave-gift-taxes-out-of-estate-planning/">gift taxes</a></span>. Gift-splitting works as follows: If an individual or their spouse makes a gift to someone else, that gift can be considered for tax purposes as having been made half by the gifter and half by his or her spouse.

However, the IRS dictates that both individuals must agree to split the gift. This means that either spouse or the couple together could make a gift of up to $28,000 to any person and not be subject to the gift tax, so long as they both agree to it. If they do, they can each can take the annual exclusion for their part of the gift. However, the tax agency also notes that if they split the gift they made, they must file a gift-tax return to show that the individual and their spouse agrees to use gift splitting. The filing requirement is the case even if half of the split gift is less than the annual exclusion.

When gifting large amounts to children or other beneficiaries and utilizing the gift-splitting rule, it may be helpful for spouses to speak with a tax professional to understand their obligations.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In another victory for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">IRS</a></span> and the Department of Justice, Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG - or Liechtenstein Bank, for short - has been ordered to pay out a large financial <a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/">tax evasion</a> settlement for aiding <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-considers-punishments-for-foreign-banks-that-aid-in-americans-tax-evasion/">Americans in avoiding taxes</a>.</span>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/liechtenstein-bank-forced-to-pay-tax-evasion-settlement-irs" rel="attachment wp-att-3339"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3339" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-evasion-settlement.jpg" alt="tax evasion settlement" width="266" height="213" /></a>The terms of an agreement with the parties will require the Vaduz-based bank to pay $23.8 million to U.S. authorities in order to avoid prosecution for its role in helping American clients violate federal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span>. When broken down, the bank will be required to forfeit $16,316,000 in revenue it earned and $7,525,542 in restitution. Further, the institution will not contest a civil forfeiture action filed in July in the Southern District of New York.

The bank was found guilty of helping account holders maintain secret accounts between 2001 and 2011. However, the company was largely able to make an agreeable deal with U.S. authorities after it began cooperating in 2008 by handing over information on clients and helping change Liechtenstein secrecy laws, according to Forbes.

The legal change allowed U.S. officials to secure financial information on banking clients, a pivotal key that helped the government locate and prosecute tax evaders. Prior to the change in the law that Liechtenstein bank helped facilitate, the small municipality of Liechtenstein - which lies between Switzerland and Austria - was considered one of the most "secretive and uncooperative tax havens" in the world, Global Post reported. However, intense pressure from the U.S., Canada, and the European Union prompted it to enter into a cooperative and information-sharing agreement with more than 30 countries.

A number of foreign financial institutions have avoided prosecution by agreeing to pay multimillion-dollar settlements. Swiss bank UBS agreed to pay $780 million in 2009, while also handing over information on 4,500 accounts. Wegelin, Switzerland's oldest bank, also entered into an agreement in which it paid out $74 million for helping U.S. clients evade taxes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Falling in line with the push for greater global collaboration to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-state-governments-rely-on-new-software-to-combat-tax-fraud/">combat tax evasion</a>,</span> the United States and the Cayman Islands have reached a tax deal to fight violations.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/u-s-cayman-islands-reach-tax-deal" rel="attachment wp-att-3347"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3347" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tax-plan.jpg" alt="tax plan" width="283" height="193" /></a>The partnership - which is partially designed to encourage other low-tax and favorable<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/offshore-tax-haven-report/">tax haven</a>s</span> to join the U.S's anti-tax evasion legislation - means that the highly-scrutinized Cayman Islands will participate in the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act set to take effect in July 2014. More specifically, the agreement "will provide certainty to Cayman's significant fund industry with respect to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/treasury-irs-delay-fatca-withholding-provision/">FATCA</a></span> implementation," said Robert Stack, the U.S. Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs, according to Reuters.

The deal is a large win for the U.S.'s battle against tax evasion, as the small Caribbean destination currently has no income tax and is therefore a popular location for individuals with large investment holdings. Once the agreement between the U.S. and the Cayman Islands is signed, the latter will be required to disclose account information on all U.S. clients who hold more than $50,000 in assets in the small island. However, these thresholds may be higher for those who are married and filing jointly, the IRS noted. Failure to comply with the new<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law</a> </span>could result in a 30 percent withholding tax on U.S. source income, and may result in countries essentially being pushed out of U.S. markets.

The threat of these penalties may play a role in encouraging other small islands and countries who have not yet signed agreements with the U.S. to either do so, or risk being alienated from lucrative U.S. financial markets. For example, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands have yet to forge an agreement with the U.S., and may face difficulties competing for investment funds with other countries that have entered into an international partnership, Reuters explained.]]></content>

However, when there are several individuals under consideration for the job, making a decision can be challenging when there is a great deal at stake. Similar to making important decisions about investments, home ownership and other large financial events, asking simple questions can help business owners assess their options and make more informed decisions.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/key-questions-to-ask-during-business-succession-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-3356"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3356" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/succession-planning.jpg" alt="succession planning" width="282" height="191" /></a>For instance, owners can begin by questioning which of their employees has the best disposition, training, and inherent skill for both managing a company and taking it to the next level. Many <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/supreme-court-rules-small-businesses-must-go-it-alone-in-arbitration/">small businesses</a> </span>- especially family-owned - may automatically consider a relative or a person who has been a leader's right-hand man as next in line, a recent Forbes article noted. However, this does not automatically mean that the person is the best for the job, and acting on emotion rather than business mentality can lead to leadership problems in the future. Instead, owners may benefit and protect their life's work by choosing a person who has the best skill set to handle the challenges of ownership.

Choosing a great leader does not always ensure the continuity and success of a company. It's also critical to think further ahead about existing and future talent pools, and how well these individuals work with the new leader. Promoting a family member or loyal worker to a higher position may leave gaps in existing roles, which should be filled prior to an owner's departure. This may help ensure a smoother transition.

Lastly, new owners and employees should be well-versed on the financials of the company, particularly as it relates to tax and estate planning. Ensuring new leaders and managers have access to pertinent documents, know which assets they are inheriting, and how these assets will be affected by tax law can help avoid any unwelcome surprises.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued a joint statement today (08-29-13) that:

<i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/rhode-island-same-sex-divorce-and-portability-imperfect-together/">Same-sex</a></span> couples legally married in jurisdictions that recognize their (same-sex) marriage will be treated as married for all federal tax purposes.</i><i><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/same-sex-married-couples-to-receive-equal-tax-treatment" rel="attachment wp-att-3365"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3365" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/equal-tax-242x300.jpg" alt="equal tax" width="186" height="224" /></a></i>

Such couples should consider filing amended individual<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning/">income tax</a> </span>returns for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The IRS will begin applying the terms of the Rev. Rul 2013-17 on September 16, 2013.

It does not matter that the couples’ state of residence does not recognize same-sex marriage. This raises the specter that there could be a difference between states as some are anti gay marriage.

This decision impacts numerous other areas of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax and benefit law</a>.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Nearly two months after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/what-happens-now-the-aftermath-of-doma-defense-of-marriage-act/">Defense of Marriage Act</a> </span>is unconstitutional, employers and employees alike are still confused about how the court's decree will affect them.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/employers-employees-still-confused-over-doma-rules" rel="attachment wp-att-3378"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3378" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/doma-rules-300x189.jpg" alt="doma rules" width="274" height="172" /></a>Employee Benefit News recently reported that many employers are unsure about whether they need to change their policies for same-sex couples immediately, and which policies need to be altered. Employees have some confusion as well about whether the Internal Revenue Service will consider where same-sex couples live when making benefit determinations or where they were married. This question could have large implications on health insurance costs.

For instance, Kaiser Health News recently noted that some employers offered health insurance to same-sex couples prior to the DOMA strike down. In these cases, employees who utilized this health insurance benefit were required to pay federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/may-a-trust-avoid-the-3-8-income-tax-surcharge/">income tax</a></span> on the value of that coverage, which is considered imputed income. Following the court's ruling, same-sex couples who live in states that allow marriage will no longer be required to pay this income. However, the issue gets more complex for couples who live outside these states.

"If the IRS decides to follow its standard practice and recognize marriages based on where a couple lives, these couples could still be responsible for paying income tax on the value of a spouse's health insurance," the analysis read. "But if the IRS goes with the place of celebration standard, couples living in states that don't recognize their marriages could avoid paying federal income tax on the spouse's health insurance."

Non-health related financial issues are also up in the air, with employers confused about whether they must provide benefits to same-sex workers retroactively. Couples are also on the fence about whether they can legally seek out refunds from prior returns if it falls within the three-year statute of limitations for amending returns. As these <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law issues</a> remain unresolved, employers are being urged to seek legal advice and proceed with caution.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is one step closer to strengthening an international community devoted to fighting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/global-tax-evasion-compliance-deadline-nears/">tax evasion</a> </span>and sharing information about potential tax cheats. After several stops and starts, the agency announced it has unveiled a new online registration for American and foreign financial institutions that need to comply with the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/irs-summons-wells-fargo-to-release-information-on-americans-with-foreign-accounts/">Foreign Account</a> </span>Tax Compliance Act.

<a title="By L.tak (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AFATCA_implementation_agreements.svg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/FATCA_implementation_agreements.svg/512px-FATCA_implementation_agreements.svg.png" alt="FATCA implementation agreements" width="512" /></a>The move represents one of the last steps the tax agency needed to take to get its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/treasury-irs-delay-fatca-withholding-provision/">FATCA</a> </span>implementation off the ground by July 2014. Although financial institutions are not required to comply with FATCA and distribute information about account holders who may be evading federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>,</span> they may face significant reputational damage and find it more challenging to compete in an international economy.

Under existing rules, U.S. taxpayers with more than $50,000 in foreign accounts must report information on those accounts. Individuals who fail to file these reports face penalties of up to $50,000, in addition to other penalties for underpayment. The rules also enable U.S. banks that are receiving funds transfers from overseas to withhold 30 percent of the cash for Americans who fail to comply with the regulations. The penalty could essentially freeze foreign institutions that disregard the rules out of U.S. financial markets.

"FATCA is an actual reality now for most banks who assumed that FATCA deadlines would continue to be pushed," Reetu Khosla, a global director at risk, fraud, and compliance at software provider Pegasystems, told American Banker. "More and more banks will need to ramp up to meet next year's deadlines to implement their rules, processes and technology to meet FATCA requirements."

The IRS will begin approving firms' registrations in 2014, as banks and institutions must register by April 25, 2014, to avoid FATCA's withholding penalties. In June 2014, the agency will publish a list of all the firms complying with FATCA, according to Reuters.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/rapper-fat-joe-goes-to-prison-for-tax-evasion" rel="attachment wp-att-3393"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3393" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tax-evasion-fat-joe.jpg" alt="tax evasion fat joe" width="249" height="249" /></a>Cartagena, who was charged with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law violations in New Jersey</a></span>, pleaded guilty in December 2012 to failing to pay taxes on more than $1 million of income in 2007 and 2008. The platinum-selling artist faced charges in New Jersey because many of the companies he earned income from are incorporated in the state. Initially facing up to two years in prison for his crimes, he received a four-month sentence and will also face an additional year of supervised release after completing his prison sentence. Cartagena will also be required to pay a $15,000 fine for his crimes.

In a recent interview with Fuse magazine, the rapper took responsibility for his mistakes, but noted that it was not entirely his fault.

"I did everything I possibly can to correct the situation," Cartagena said, according to the Los Angeles Times. "I paid them back. It wasn't entirely my fault. I had a new accountant for like the last four years. And then you could see that my accountant that worked for me for the 15 years prior to that always paid my stuff on time, always had it on time."

Fat Joe is not the first artist to face prison time after being charged with tax evasion. Grammy-winning singer<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/lauryn-hill-receives-prison-sentence-for-tax-evasion/">Lauryn Hill</a></span> is currently serving a three-month prison sentence in Connecticut for failing to pay more than $1.8 million in earnings between 2005 and 2007. Hill's sentencing also took into account unpaid state and federal taxes in 2008 and 2009, bringing the total amount of owed taxes to $2.3 million. Similar to Fat Joe, Hill will also face tighter supervision for a year after she is released from prison.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[There is a difficult and uneasy relationship between the <a href="/thats-it-were-splitting-up-the-disconnect-between-the-new-jersey-gross-income-tax-and-the-federal-income-tax/">Federal Income Tax (FIT) and the New Jersey Gross Income Tax (NJGIT)</a>. Despite the fact that the income for FIT purposes is the starting point for NJGIT purposes, there are significant differences. One observation is that NJGIT is unfriendly when it comes to the types of deductions allowed, the ability to carry losses to other years, and offsetting income and losses from different categories.

<a title="By The Government of India (deity.gov.in) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AIncomeTax.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/IncomeTax.jpg" alt="IncomeTax" width="256" /></a>In <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warsal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">v.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Director</span></i>, the differences between a FIT non-business bad-debt loss and NJGIT treatment is readily apparent. Although NJGIT permits some losses to be recognized, it does not provide for federal treatment to carryover to New Jersey in every case. The issue was whether the bad debt owed by a family member was a sale or disposition for NJGIT purposes. The court held that it was not and therefore was not deductible. Although the debt was deductible for federal purposes as a non-business bad debt that theory was not recognized for NJGIT. The taxpayer advanced the theory that the debtor’s non-payment constituted a “disposition” under state law which permitted the taxpayer to recognize gain or loss.

A second issue was whether the federal treatment of the bad debt constituted a “method of accounting” that the state must follow for NJGIT purposes. The court stated that it was not a method of accounting to be imported into state law.

A second issue involves losses from S corporations. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">State Tax</a> Bulletin GIT – 9S provides that:<i> In no case can you adjust your New Jersey adjusted basis in the stock below zero. S corporation losses which you are unable to use for New Jersey gross income tax purposes to offset income  from another S corporation in the year the losses are incurred </i><b><i>may not be used to offset S corporation income in any other taxable year</i></b><i>. However, such unused losses will be used to adjust your New Jersey adjusted basis when calculating your gain/loss from the disposition of your shares of the S corporation</i>

N.J.S.A.54A:5-2 only permits losses to offset income of the same class incurred in the same year. The state required taxpayers to reduce their state basis even when they were unable to use the losses and such a view prevailed until the a defeat in court.

In the aftermath of 2008, many businesses generated losses. Unfortunately, the losses from prior years were of no help for NJGIT purposes when the major asset was sold. One taxpayer recognized gain for NJGIT paid state income tax but did not for FIT. In net economic terms, the taxpayer lost money even with the proceeds of sale. Planning is imperative.

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is not backing down on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a <a href="former-nba-team-owners-estate-challenges-irs-on-1-9-billion-in-estate-gift-tax-dispute">tax dispute</a></span> claiming that the estate of the late Piston's owner Bill Davidson owes more than $2 billion in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a>es</span>. The agency said the large estate bill is the result of Davidson's misuse o<span style="text-decoration: underline;">f <a href="/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law/">gift tax law</a> </span>and his underpayment for sizable gifts made to family members. The agency is also disputing the value of stocks put in trusts for his heirs.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tax-dispute-300x261.jpg" alt="tax dispute" />Davidson's estate representatives contend that they do not owe the IRS anything more than what they have already paid in estate taxes, and the dispute is likely to play out in court as both parties are unwilling to concede. The estate asserts that the federal tax agency has greatly inflated the tax bill - which is approximately $2.8 billion, according to the Detroit Free Press. However, the agency fired back in a U.S. Tax Court in Washington, and said that Davidson failed to report on large gifts and did not properly value certain investments passed on to beneficiaries.

For instance, the agency argues that Davidson failed to use the same standards and methods of establishing value of stocks that the IRS uses. In addition, it charges that Davidson's life expectancy was a key determination in establishing the value of self-canceling installment notes, the newspaper reports. With these notes, Davidson could essentially transfer assets to family members, who would make payments on the assets while Davidson lived. After his death, the family members would own the assets outright.

Although physicians gave Davidson a clean bill of health in the months before his death and presumed that he had several years left in his life expectancy, the agency - which uses life expectancy to determine whether payments are taxed or considered gifts - claims that these amounts are taxable.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">Tax professionals</a> </span>frequently encounter non-qualified deferred compensation plans (“NQDCA”) in the context of an estate or business. NQDCA’s include any arrangement where an employee or a service provider (independent contractor) receives <i>a legally binding right </i>to receive compensation in one year but it is not actually received until a later year.  A<i> legally binding right </i>includes those situations where the service provider has the right to receive income if conditions are met. The inherent problem is that many plans in place have not been reviewed for compliance and have not been modified to satisfy these rules. The consequences of an IRC §409A violation are severe and include a back<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/uneasy-link-between-federal-income-tax-and-nj-gross-income-tax/">income tax</a></span>, interest from the original date of deferral, and a penalty equal to 20% of the deferred compensation.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/the-irc-§409a-minefield" rel="attachment wp-att-3419"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3419" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/irc1.jpg" alt="irc" width="289" height="177" /></a>§409A was enacted in 2004 and regulations, consisting of nearly 400 pages, were issued in 2007. §409A also applies to a NQDCA between a partnership and its employees. Partnership equity awards are covered by a separate set of rules, at least for now.

§409A does not trigger recognition of income if the NQDCA satisfies certain requirements. First, deferrals in advance of having the right to the income must be made by the service provider (employee, independent contractor). Second, there must be a definite payment schedule which may include payments to be made after death or upon disability of the service provider, on a change of control or unforeseen emergency. Third, employees of publically traded employers must wait six months before receiving payment. Fourth, a service provider may alter a payment schedule by accelerating or deferring payments for Qualified Domestic Relations Order, but not beyond five (5) years.

An individual relying on NQDCA payments for retirement income would do well to ensure compliance. An individual owning an interest in a business would be well advised to become compliant to protect the value of the enterprise. Finally, clients who contemplate selling their businesses would do well to address the issue before due diligence begins and the sales price of the business is diminished by the potential liability.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/small-businesses-face-more-irs-audits-than-their-larger-counterparts/">Small businesses</a> </span>may face increased scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service, which recently announced that it believes small companies may be under-reporting cash payments.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-begins-crackdown-of-small-businesses/small-businesses/" rel="attachment wp-att-3427"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3427" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/small-businesses-269x300.jpg" alt="small businesses" width="243" height="270" /></a>Resulting from the possibility of many <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/small-business-audits/">small business audits</a> </span>in the future, the agency recently sent out 20,000 letters since fall 2012, notifying owners of "possible income under-reporting." The IRS said it sent out these letters after examining the credit card transactions of a large number of small entities across the country. After its analysis, the tax agency said it is now trying to identify companies that receive an "unusually high portion" of reported sales through credit card transactions and may be under-reporting cash payments, CNN Money reports. The IRS is essentially targeting companies whose ratio of credit card to cash seems unusual for their industry, the news source added. The possible impending small business audits has owners and entities worried.

"You received one or more of these letters and notices because you may have under-reported your gross receipts," said the agency. "This is based on your tax return and Form(s) 1099-K, Payment/Merchant Cards and Third Party Network Transactions that show an unusually high portion of receipts from card payments and other Form 1099-K reportable transactions."

Business owners who receive the notices are typically given 30 days to respond in the way of a written explanation. However, many company owners are unsure of how to respond to the alleged <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law violations</a></span>, with many asserting that they have accurately reported all income. In addition, many business owners argue that the IRS cannot accurately ascertain whether businesses are in compliance with tax law simply by relying upon industry averages, rather than concrete evidence of wrongdoing.

However, it is unclear if the IRS will seek out new barometers to measure compliance as it attempts to close the multibillion-dollar tax gap, $140 billion of which is attributed to noncompliance by small businesses.]]></content>

<a title="By Swiss Bank Corporation / Bankers Magazine [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASwiss_Bank_Board_Room_(UBS)c.1920.png"><img width="512" alt="Swiss Bank Board Room (UBS)c.1920" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Swiss_Bank_Board_Room_%28UBS%29c.1920.png/512px-Swiss_Bank_Board_Room_%28UBS%29c.1920.png"/></a>U.S. authorities announced that Swiss banks seeking to avoid prosecution for facilitating tax evasion through the use of secret accounts held by Americans may still face penalties of up to 50 percent of the asset value. According to the agreement, participating banks must agree to a 20 percent penalty of the value of undisclosed U.S. accounts held by the bank on August 1, 2008.  The penalty will increase to 30 percent for secret accounts opened after that date but before the end of February 2009. Any secret accounts opened after February 2009 will incur the maximum 50 percent fee.

Although the deal will not apply to those 14 Swiss institutions already under investigation, authorities will allow other institutions to avoid criminal probes if they agree to pay the penalties and disclose information on U.S. clients.

In addition to providing information on an account-by-account basis, participating banks will be required to cooperate in treaty requests for account information and close bank accounts of those American clients who fail to comply with U.S. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax laws</a></span>.

"This program will significantly enhance the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to aggressively pursue those who attempt to evade the law by hiding their assets outside of the United States," said Attorney General Eric Holder. "In addition to strengthening our partnership with the Swiss government, the program's requirement that Swiss banks provide detailed account information will improve our ability to bring tax dollars back to the U.S. treasury from across the globe."

In light of hefty penalties and financial ramifications, the Justice Department and Swiss Federal Department of Finance released a joint statement urging Switzerland to encourage banks to participate.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A growing number of Americans are renouncing their U.S. citizenship and handing in their passports at faster rates in an effort to avoid rising high tax rates and complicated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span>, according to a newly-published government report.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/report-rising-number-of-americans-relinquish-citizenship-to-avoid-high-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-3445"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3445" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/high-taxes-300x267.jpg" alt="high taxes" width="300" height="267" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service released its Quarterly Publication of Individuals who have chosen to Expatriate in the Federal Register. The findings reveal that during the fourth quarter of 2012 - ending on December 31 - 45 Americans renounced their U.S. citizenship. This number increased to 679 during the first quarter of the year, ending on March 31, and jumped by 1,130 during the second quarter alone.

The spike in the number of people renouncing their citizenship has largely been attributed to the upcoming implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/government-issues-final-rules-on-fatca/">FATCA</a></span>), which will require foreign financial institutions to disclose more account information on assets and investments held by U.S. taxpayers. The new tax law is expected to provide for more transparency, build an international network of institutions<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/">combating tax evasion</a></span>, and lower the prevalence of tax law violations. New penalties recently announced by the government revealed that Swiss banks that want to avoid criminal lawsuits may be required to pay as much as 50 percent in penalties for hiding foreign accounts held by Americans. This move is expected to greatly diminish the viability of Swiss tax havens.

As these penalties and further pressure on foreign institutions continues, some Americans who can no longer gain favorable tax treatment by hiding assets overseas have opted to renounce their citizenship to legally avoid American income tax. However, some analysts agree that the FATCA is not the sole driver of the spike in renounced citizenships recently. An increase in capital gains and income tax rates in 2013 may also be a component in the high number of renunciations, the San Francisco Gate reports.]]></content>

The agency issued an official Notice of Deficiency to the estate in May.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-goes-after-michael-jacksons-estate-for-702-million-tax-bill" rel="attachment wp-att-3450"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3450" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tax-bill-300x294.jpg" alt="tax bill" width="230" height="225" /></a>The $702 million tax bill revolves around Jackson's Neverland Ranch, his image and likeness, and several recording properties. Although the estate is challenging the tax agency's assertion, it has yet to reveal any specific amounts for which it may be liable, Reuters reports. Jackson's attorneys did pay <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate taxes</a> </span>when the pop star passed, the value of the estate is in question, which may be lead to a lengthy dispute in the U.S. Tax Court. This is largely because some of the assets in question - such as Jackson's image and likeness - may be challenging to quantify.

This has been evidenced by the year-long struggle between attorney's for the estate and the IRS to reach a resolution.

"The government believes estates of celebrities likely have a significant audit potential," a representative of Jackson's estate told Reuters. "The estate believes the estate tax return properly reflected the interests of Mr. Jackson as of the date of his death."

Forbes noted that federal estate tax return for Jackson's estate reported a taxable estate of approximately $9 million. However, many tax analysts estimate the total worth of the estate to be around $400 million, leaving a large gap in what was paid and what still may be owed, especially once interest and penalties are assessed. Under existing tax law, the penalties for Jackson's estate could be as high as 40 percent of the difference between the taxes paid and those allegedly owed for some of the assets in question.]]></content>

The difficulty, however, arises from the administrative and compliance issues faced as a result of such a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tis-the-season-to-be-charitable/">charitable</a></span> bequest make it impractical in most instances. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes numerous restrictions on these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax practices</a></span> and discourages non-profit organizations from competing directly against for-profit companies in commercial setting. (Imagine the competitive advantage you would have if your business were not subject to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/uneasy-link-between-federal-income-tax-and-nj-gross-income-tax/">income tax</a>.)</span>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/charitable-bequest-of-a-business-and-the-problems-that-follow/charitable-bequest/" rel="attachment wp-att-3458"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3458" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/charitable-bequest-300x234.jpg" alt="charitable bequest" width="266" height="207" /></a>IRC §4943 prohibits private foundations from having <i>excess business holdings</i> in a <i>business enterprise</i>. A private foundation is a type of exempt organization that receives substantial support from only a few contributors or sources. Unlike many of the well-known public charities that receive contributions from thousands of people, a private foundation is controlled by a few substantial contributors. The IRC imposes tighter restrictions upon private foundations because of the absence of public oversight and <i>de facto</i> control by the contributors is suspect in the eyes of the IRS.

There are two exceptions. First, a business whose income is substantially (95% or more) passive in character. This makes sense because the IRC has the opportunity to tax a corporation that pays dividends, so there is no fear that business income will escape taxation.

The second exception is for a <i>functionally related business</i> (“FRB”) and it is rarely used. This is why PLR 201323029 is so interesting. FRB is defined as a business that is not an unrelated trade or business or is an activity which is carried on within a group of activities which are related to the exempt purpose of an organization. A classic example is a medical journal that reports on medical developments, but also contains medical advertising which is deemed related to the exempt purpose.

PLR 201323029 described an artist’s foundation that was dedicated to the creation and exhibition of art as well as art education. The artist’s business was held in a for-profit corporation. Upon the artist’s death, ownership of the corporation’s shares would pass to the foundation that would use the revenue to support its programs.

The usefulness of this PLR may be limited; however, it is important to notice that the foundations efforts to advance art were ongoing during the artist’s lifetime. It may have been helpful to obtaining the ruling that the charitable activities being conducted were already qualified and the applicant need only promise that they continue after death.]]></content>

The report, which specifically examined the audit process in the IRS's Small Business/Self-Employed Division, noted that filing checks may be strengthened in the coming years.

These checks help the agency determine whether the same pattern of noncompliance discovered on an audited tax return is also present on the prior- and subsequent-year tax returns, Accounting Today notes. The results of this analysis helps the federal tax agency determine whether prior and future returns should be audited as well. As a result of the report, which urged the IRS to develop new strategies for strengthening the audit process, the agency plans to implement new plans for strengthening correspondence audits.

"We agree that, in certain circumstances, it makes sense to audit the prior- and/or subsequent-year return; however, we need to consider various factors when making that determination," wrote Ruth Perez of the IRS's Small Business/Self-Employed Division, in response to the report, according to Accounting Today.

For instance, Perez noted that the statute of limitations, cost-effectiveness of proposed procedures, and the potential to recover significant taxes will all play a role in how the IRS chooses to proceed.

"We agree that there may be some measurable benefit derived from your recommendations," said Perez. "However, we believe the outcome measure, as calculated, does not take into account the impact of our model of working the next best case or our procedures to ensure we only work cases with sufficient time on the statute of limitations for assessment."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Since 2008, the U.S. economy has struggled and employers faced with the dilemma of either paying employees and vendors, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">paying employment tax</a> </span>often chose the former. The belief is that they can always catch up. Unfortunately, I have seen many employers incur substantial <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/estate-executors-may-carry-personal-tax-liability/">tax liability</a></span> for employment taxes, interest and penalties, and have found themselves personally liable.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/department-of-justice-considers-personal-benefit-an-important-factor-in-prosecuting-employment-tax-cases/" rel="attachment wp-att-3479"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3479" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/employment-tax-259x300.jpg" alt="employment tax" width="220" height="230" /></a>The Department of Justice will now consider whether an individual personally benefited from employment taxes that were not properly withheld or paid as a key factor in considering whether it will criminally prosecute a case.

"Using the money to keep a business afloat is not a defense against criminal liability for an employer, but the DOJ is less likely to prosecute in that case than when the employer is using the funds to purchase homes, cars, and other luxury items," said Margaret Leigh Kessler, Assistant Chief (Western Criminal Enforcement Section), DOJ Tax Division.

Speaking during the "Civil and Criminal Tax Penalties" session of the American Bar Association Section of Taxation meeting in San Francisco, Kessler pointed out that no one factor is dispositive as to whether a case will become criminal. She said there are many different factors that may cause the IRS to refer a case to the DOJ for criminal prosecution, including engaging in a course of illegal conduct over a long period; taking aggressive measures to actively hide assets once the Service has determined noncompliance; and lying to the IRS agents reviewing the case.

"The size of the business is not a driving factor," Kessler said. "While a case involving large amounts of money may be more attractive to the DOJ, officials wouldn't be eager to prosecute it criminally if they didn't have evidence that the money was being used for personal benefit."

Those employers who use employment taxes for cars, vacation homes and the like now face not only personal liability but criminal prosecution.]]></content>

The Internal Revenue Service recently issued guidance to employers about how the landmark ruling may affect them, which may help them avoid <a href="department-of-justice-considers-personal-benefit-an-important-factor-in-prosecuting-employment-tax-cases">tax and employment law</a> issues in the future.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-to-help-employers-understand-tax-treatment-of-benefits-for-same-sex-employees" rel="attachment wp-att-3477"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3477" alt="tax treatment" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tax-treatment-300x163.jpg" width="247" height="134" /></a>The most significant employee benefit plan aspects of the IRS's eagerly awaited guidance mandate that the value of employer-provided health coverage for employee's same-sex spouse is to no longer be included in the employee's gross income for federal tax purposes. In addition, contributions made by an employee for the coverage of a same-sex spouse are no longer required to be paid on an after-tax basis. Finally, retirement plans must recognize a same-sex spouse for purposes of qualified joint and survivor annuity and spouse death benefits.

The IRS also addressed the confusing question of whether spouses married in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage will receive spousal benefits if they relocate to a state that does not recognize same-sex marriages. Under IRS guidance, couples married in states that legally acknowledge same-sex marriage will be considered married for federal tax purposes in all states. The same holds true for couples who were married in countries that recognize these unions - such as Canada - when they return to the U.S.

Finally, the tax agency noted that employers are not mandated to make adjustments to employee's wages for the imputed value of health and welfare benefits provided before 2013. While they may make adjustments to imputed income for 2013, they are not required by tax law to do so. Finally, those companies that paid FICA taxes on imputed income for all open tax years - 2010, 2011, and 2012 - are permitted to file a claim for refunds with the IRS.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has provided a great deal more guidance on how tips extended to waiters and waitresses, hair stylists, and other professionals should be reported for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/uneasy-link-between-federal-income-tax-and-nj-gross-income-tax/">federal tax</a></span> purposes. However, the agency recently announced a new policy governing the tax treatment of automatic gratuities, which may change the way that restaurants charge large parties in the future.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-to-count-automatic-gratuities-as-wages" rel="attachment wp-att-3488"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3488" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/automatic-gratuities-173x300.jpg" alt="automatic gratuities" width="172" height="299" /></a>Under the new <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a>, automatic gratuities - such as the popular 18 percent tax for large parties - will be treated and taxed as wages, rather than self-reported tips. Automatic gratuities - or service charges as they are now called - are those charged for large tables, and the charges are built into the bill and currently count as tips that are not subject to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/struggling-to-meet-business-costs-dont-neglect-payroll-taxes/">payroll tax</a> </span>withholding. Under the new rule, service charges will be subject to payroll tax withholding. This, in turn, may raise costs for restaurants, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Already, some restaurants are considering eliminating these types of tips altogether, including Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster. This scenario could also have an averse effect on waiters and waitresses who make less than the minimum wage, as these gratuities often help these workers at least reach minimum wage, the Daily Caller reports. The rule initially went into effect in 2012, but was pushed back to January 2014 to give restaurants time to comply with the new mandate.

"The change would mean more paperwork and added costs for the restaurants - and a potential financial hit for waiters and waitresses who live on their tips but don't always report them fully," according to the Journal.

The IRS says the absence of any of these four factors indicates that gratuity may be a service charge: The payment must be made free from compulsion, the customer must have the unrestricted right to determine the amount, the payment should not be the subject of negotiation or dictated by employer policy and the customer has the right to determine who receives the payment.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/facebooks-ipo-grabbed-the-headlines-but-eaton-pulled-a-coup/">Facebook’s Initial Public Offering (IPO)</a></span> received a great deal of attention, especially after the price of its stock dropped shortly after its first day of trading. The decline in price dominated the news for weeks. While driving to the office this week, I listened to Bloomberg report that Facebook’s stock price hit $50 a share on September 26, 2013. The Bloomberg report validated the planning strategies undertaken by the Facebook insiders and demonstrates that the timing of a transfer may yield incalculable benefits.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/facebook-at-50-dollars-a-share/facebook-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3500"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3500" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/facebook1.jpg" alt="facebook" width="238" height="199" /></a>On June 4, 2012, I wrote about a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/what-facebook-expatriation-and-the-ex-patriot-act-have-in-common/">Facebook insider who expatriated</a></span> from the U.S. to Singapore. Mr. Eduardo Saverin relinquished his U.S. citizenship in September 2011, months before the public offering on May 18, 2012. The act of expatriation causes the departing United States citizen to recognize gain on a deemed sale of all of his assets. Assuming a market value of $25 per share at the time of expatriation, the timing of Mr. Saverin’s departure appears to have saved him hundreds of millions of dollars in income and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate taxes</a></span>. Given that the IPO price was not set and the sluggish economy, the figure actually used may have been lower than my estimate. After all, we were coming out of a recession and there were no other comparable transactions in the market. Any estimate of value in 2011 was tempered by doom and gloom of a moribund economy and an uninspired or non-existent IPO market. The timing of Mr. Saverin’s departure worked to his advantage.

On June 11, 2012, I wrote about Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRAT) and the various strategies one might put in place to hedge a decline in price. The news was filled with stories of Facebook insiders who remained U.S. citizens and utilized GRATs or rolling GRATs (as described in my blog on July 25, 2012). When we look back to May 2012, these insiders saved themselves an incredible amount of money. In our gift tax system, we must value the gift upon the date of transfer. The stock price has nearly doubled in value and approximately one-half of an insider’s wealth may have been moved outside of the transfer tax system. Assume the transfer to the GRAT is valued at  $26 per share and the value rises to $50, this means that $24 per share passes to the remainder without being subject to gift tax.

Corporate insiders and knowledgeable investors anticipate when stock and asset values will rise. In today’s slow or low growth economy, each day brings us closer to more normal economic activity and increasing asset values. Thus, it appears that we should be able to anticipate escalating asset prices in the coming years. Now would be an ideal time to transfer appreciating assets to a GRAT in order to lock in the lower values for purposes of the computations required by the transfer tax system.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/wills-in-era-of-digital-signatures-electronic-signatures-and-of-no-signatures/">Will contests</a> </span>alleging undue influence are not uncommon. A will was, for many years, the only means of transmitting property from a decedent to an heir. New forms of ownership were created as the result of the public’s disdain for will contests and delays in transferring property though probate. The result was new forms of ownership that were designed to provide the survivor with immediate access to the bank or brokerage account. <i>Transfer on Death</i> (TOD), <i>Payable on Death</i> (POD) and <i>joint tenancy with the right of survivorship (JTROS) </i>accounts<i> </i>pass property by operation of law outside of the probate estate<i>. </i>Life insurance and retirement benefits are similar in that property passes in accordance with the beneficiary designation contained in form that may be filed by mail or on-line.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/joint-and-pod-accounts-weapon-of-choice-of-transferees-when-exerting-undue-influence" rel="attachment wp-att-3503"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3503" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/undue-influence-199x300.jpg" alt="undue influence" width="174" height="262" /></a>A person exerting undue influence will find it easier to be named as a beneficiary of a POD, TOD or JTWROS account rather than by will. When a charge of undue influence is leveled, the courts use a similar analysis to that in a will contest. Typically, when the moving party is able to demonstrate that certain factors are present, a presumption in favor of undue influence arises which must then be rebutted. Undue influence is presumed when a person having a confidential relationship actively secures or procures the instrument of transfer and is a beneficiary of such a transfer. The person is able to prevail upon the donor because of the donor’s ill health, frailty, lack of capacity.

A recent Florida case, <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estate</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span></i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kester</span></i>, examined the traditional factors, however, it is difficult for a reader to determine how much weight the court assigned to each factor in arriving at its conclusion. Despite being named agent under a power of attorney, the defendant was not the only child with a close relationship to the decedent. In addition, the decedent changed the beneficiary designations independently of the defendant.

In a New Jersey case, <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">re</span> Estate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bagno</span></i>, the Appellate Division examined the use of joint accounts. Under N.J.S.A. 17:16I-5(a), the surviving joint account holder is entitled to the account unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time the account is created. A party may prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the surviving account holder had a confidential relationship with the donor. Once there is a presumption of undue influence, the burden of persuasion shifts to the survivor.

The Appellate Division evaluated the relationship between donor and donee, the donor’s physical and mental health, the donor’s reliance on the donee for care, whether the donee is a substantial beneficiary, whether account was created openly or in secret, whether the account is at variance with donor’s<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate plan</a></span> or previous estate plans. One factor that is especially important is whether the donee assisted in establishing the account or was the account created with the help of others.

It is particularly troublesome to see an estate plan upset by a subsequent change resulting from a POD account or a beneficiary designation. Typically, the change drains the estate of liquidity or shifts the tax burden disproportionately to property passing by the will.

One constant and recurring theme in estate planning is the abuse of trust placed in agents under a Power of Attorney or in persons having a confidential relationship with a transferor. An analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding an account designation is similar to that of a will and is just as costly.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/irs-to-count-automatic-gratuities-as-wages/">Internal Revenue Service</a></span> landed a huge victory in U.S. Tax Court recently, and the ruling may have significant implications for multinational companies who have profits abroad.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-scores-13-million-victory-against-bmc-software/bmc-software/" rel="attachment wp-att-3511"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3511" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bmc-software.jpg" alt="bmc software" width="257" height="160" /></a>The court ruled that BMC Software will be forced to pay $13 million - plus penalties and interest - to the IRS in relation to a dispute about a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/irs-embattled-with-technology-firms-over-2004-corporate-tax-holiday/">2004 corporate income tax repatriation holiday</a></span>. The controversial tax holiday allowed multinational companies holding funds offshore to bring those into the United States at a reduced tax rate of 5.25 percent, rather than the 35 percent statutory rate. The corporate tax holiday was designed to encourage multinational firms with significant holdings to bring those resources into the U.S. and invest in the domestic economy.

Under the tax holiday, BMC repatriated roughly $717.2 million. However, the IRS argued that during this period, BMC was also engaging in transfer pricing abuses by shifting profits from high tax countries to low tax countries, and then stockpiling these funds without paying taxes on them, Forbes reports. The IRS and BMC settled the pricing transfer issues - but because the company's U.S. profits increased under the settlement, the IRS asserted that more taxes were owed under the tax holiday provision.

While the company argued that the pricing transfer settlement and the repatriation <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span> were not related, the tax court took a different stance.

"The Commissioner and the taxpayer were bound to treat the payment as a return of principal for all Federal income tax purposes and the repayment was no longer a dividend. In short, we did not permit inconsistent characterizations for Federal income tax purposes," according to Judge Diane Kroupa's court opinion.

Other multinational firms are expected to face similar scrutiny from the IRS in the coming months, including Massachusetts-based Analog Devices.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Two financial investors who purchased municipal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/mary-j-blige-tax-lien/">tax liens</a></span> pleaded guilty today for their roles in a conspiracy to rig bids at auctions conducted by New Jersey municipalities for the sale of those tax liens, the Department of Justice announced.

<a href="investors-plead-guilty-to-rig-bids-at-new-jersey-municipal-tax-auctions" rel="attachment wp-att-3523"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3523" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rig-bids-300x300.jpg" alt="rig bids" width="215" height="215" /></a>A felony charge was filed today in U.S. District Court against Robert U. Del Vecchio Sr., of Hawthorne, N.J. who according to the charge, from 2000 until December 2008, participated in a conspiracy to rig bids at auctions for the sale of municipal tax liens by agreeing to allocate among certain bidders which liens each would bid on. Additionally, a felony charge was filed against Michael Mastellone, of Cedar Knolls, N.J. for participating in a similar conspiracy from 2000 until February 2009. The department said that Del Vecchio Sr. and Mastellone proceeded to submit bids in accordance with the agreements and purchased tax liens at collusive and non-competitive <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/rising-interest-rates-will-make-certain-gifts-more-costly/">interest rates</a>.</span>

"By conspiring to rig the bids of municipal tax liens, the conspirators profited at the expense of those already struggling financially," said Scott D. Hammond, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division's criminal enforcement program. "Protecting Americans from these types of bid-rigging schemes remains a high priority for the division."

The department said the primary purpose of the conspiracy was to suppress and restrain competition in order to obtain selected municipal tax liens offered at public auctions at non-competitive interest rates. When the owner of real property fails to pay taxes on that property, the municipality in which the property is located may attach a lien for the amount of the unpaid taxes. If the taxes remain unpaid after a waiting period, the lien may be sold at auction.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">State tax law</a></span> requires that investors bid on the interest rate delinquent property owners will pay upon redemption. By law, the bid opens at 18 percent interest and, through a competitive bidding process, can be driven down to zero percent. If a lien remains unpaid after a certain period of time, the investor who purchased the lien may begin foreclosure proceedings against the property to which the lien is attached.

According to the court documents, Del Vecchio Sr. and Mastellone were involved in the conspiracy with others not to bid against one another at municipal tax lien auctions in New Jersey. Since the conspiracy permitted the conspirators to purchase tax liens with limited competition, each conspirator was able to obtain liens which earned a higher interest rate. Property owners were therefore made to pay higher interest on their tax debts than they would have paid had their liens been purchased in open and honest competition.

A violation of the Sherman Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals. The maximum fine for a Sherman Act violation may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims if either amount is greater than the $1 million statutory maximum.

Today's pleas are the 13th and 14th guilty pleas resulting from an ongoing investigation into bid rigging or fraud related to municipal tax lien auctions. Nine individuals -- Isadore H. May, Richard J. Pisciotta Jr., William A. Collins, Robert W. Stein, David M. Farber, Robert E. Rothman, Stephen E. Hruby, David Butler and Norman T. Remick -- and three companies -- DSBD LLC, Crusader Servicing Corp. and Mercer S.M.E. Inc. -- have previously pleaded guilty as part of this investigation.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-releases-new-regulations-for-deductible-business-repairs" rel="attachment wp-att-3529"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3529" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/business-repairs.jpg" alt="business repairs" width="243" height="227" /></a>The new rules, which broaden the scope of business expenditures that may qualify as deductible asset repairs, may help limit the number of corporate<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/report-irs-to-increase-audits-of-prior-and-subsequent-year-tax-returns/">tax audits</a></span> the agency takes on each year, especially as it seeks to operate within a tightened budget. The regulations may also help companies reduce their liability, as they may now deduct costs that were previously prohibited under the law. The final guidelines, which replace temporary rules that have been in place since December 2011, will affect all taxpayers who acquire, produce, or improve tangible property.

The IRS raised many dollar-amount thresholds, including the previous $100 threshold for property that is exempt from capitalization to $200. The agency also changed the treatment of additional costs of acquiring property subject to the safe harbor to include additional invoice costs, such as delivery fees. The final rules simplify the de minimis safe harbor by requiring that all materials and supplies be included if taxpayers elect to use the safe-harbor method. The IRS will also allow business owners with gross receipts of $10 million or less to elect to deduct, for buildings that initially cost $1 million or less, the lesser of $10,000 or 2 percent of the adjusted basis of the property for repairs.

The IRS has been working on these tangible property repair regulations since 2004, and the updated version of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span> will go into effect on January 1, 2014. As the rules - which are outlined in a 220-page document - are final and quite expansive, business owners should consider contacting a legal or tax professional to learn more about their options and obligations under the new guidelines.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Ty Warner, founder of the iconic Beanie Baby empire, has agreed to plead guilty to federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/">tax evasion</a></span> charges. His admission comes only days after being listed by Forbes as one of the richest people in the world.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/beanie-baby-founder-pleads-guilty-to-53-million-tax-evasion"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3537" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-evasion-TY.jpg" alt="tax evasion" width="273" height="231" /></a>Warner was formally charged last week in a U.S. District Court for hiding more than $3.1 million in offshore Swiss bank accounts. His net worth is estimated to be roughly $2.6 billion. Following his guilty plea, Warner will be subject to a 53.5 million civil penalty, which he has already agreed to pay. Warner is now the the second person charged in federal court in connection with an ongoing investigation involving Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and other overseas banks charged with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-considers-punishments-for-foreign-banks-that-aid-in-americans-tax-evasion/">assisting Americans in committing tax evasion</a></span> violations. A representative for Warner called the situation "unfortunate" and noted that the businessman and philanthropist has been attempting to resolve these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax issues</a></span> for years, and even tried to enroll in the IRS's Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program in 2009.

The U.S. is ramping up efforts to uncover offshore account holders who have attempted to shield income from the government, as any recovered funds may help the IRS to close the multibillion-dollar tax gap.

"Regardless of wealth, everyone must pay taxes on all of their income, not just the amount they choose to report. The charge alleges that Warner went to great lengths to hide from his accountants and the IRS more than $3.1 million in foreign income generated in a secret Swiss account," said Gary Shapiro, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

Despite Warner's admission of guilt and agreement to pay civil fines and penalties, he may still be subject to jail time. A federal-tax-evasion conviction of this magnitude could mean up to five years in prison for the business mogul.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Decanting is a popular topic among wealth advisers, trust companies, and tax professionals.  In the wine industry, it means putting old wine into a new bottle.  In the trust field, it means to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/transfer-assets-before-estate-tax-increases/">transfer assets</a> </span>to a new trust to be governed by a new trust instrument that takes into account changes in law and in the circumstances of the beneficiaries. In legal terms, decanting is the exercise of a discretionary power by a fiduciary to appoint assets to a trust or similar arrangement.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/decanting-by-various-means/decanting/" rel="attachment wp-att-3547"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3547" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/decanting.jpg" alt="decanting" width="265" height="160" /></a>The issue is the source of the discretionary power.  Is it found in common law, statute or in the trust instrument?  In the absence of a specific case or statute, how does one go about construing this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">trust law</a></span>.

Many jurisdictions look to the Restatement of Trusts for guidance in the absence of statutory authority or case law. In 1940, the Florida Supreme Court held that the power to make outright distributions includes the power to create a lesser estate, that is, one in trust. Thus, the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/the-birds-and-the-bees-for-trustees/">trustee</a></span> could establish a new trust for the beneficiary and transfer assets from the old trust.  If the trustee could make an outright distribution of assets to the beneficiary, why not permit a transfer to a new trust created for the benefit of the beneficiary.

The State of Michigan enacted a decanting statute and thereby joined New York, Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, Florida and eight other states. The fact that a statute was enacted gives you some idea of the uncertainty involved.   Before these statutes were enacted, common law controlled whether decanting was possible. In New Jersey, there is only one case on point.  In <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wiedenmeyer</span></i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">v</span></i>. <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson</span></i>, the Appellate Division focused on the trust instrument that gave the trustee’s absolute and uncontrolled discretion to distribute assets in the best interests of the beneficiary.  The court stated it would analyze whether the  trustee’s exercise of this power constituted an abuse of discretion. The decision implied that common law did not prohibit decanting but it is unclear whether the decision authorized decanting in other situations.  What does one do where the identical language is not present?  New Jersey has yet to adopt the Uniform Trust Code, where said bill has died in committee in each of the past two years, nor has the legislature addressed this specific issue.

New York’s statute requires that if the existing trust limits the trustee’s discretion to make distributions, the receiving trust must have the same limitations on trustee’s discretion and the same beneficiaries.

Delaware goes a bit further than most states in that it permits the new trust to grant powers of appointment that may be exercised in favor of persons who are not beneficiaries in the original trust. Where the trustee is a beneficiary, decanting the beneficiary-trustee is prohibited.  Most states consider the power to decant to be a special power of appointment and prohibit the addition of new beneficiaries.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morse</span></i> <i>v. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kraft</span></i> (yes, the owner of the Patriots), authorized the transfer of property to new subtrusts without the consent of beneficiaries or a court. Relying on <i>Phipps</i> and <i>Wiedenmayer</i>, the Court relied on trust language giving the trustee discretion to distribute property directly to the beneficiary or for the benefit of the beneficiary which included distribution in further trust.  Massachusetts has adopted the Uniform Trust Code and the Uniform Probate Code so perhaps the court was seeking to limit the reach of its decision and defer to statutes enacted by the legislature.

The absence of uniformity among the states suggests that forum shopping shall continue.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is pulling out all the stops to support a set of proposed rules that would allow it to better regulate tax preparers, as evidenced by its use of a long-forgotten law from the 1800s to justify its argument.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-relies-on-rule-from-1800s-to-justify-tax-preparer-regulations/tax-preparer-regulations/" rel="attachment wp-att-3555"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3555" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/decanting.jpg" alt="tax preparer regulations" width="266" height="166" /></a>At an appellate court hearing challenging the IRS<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span>, Justice Department representative Gilbert Rothenberg cited the "Horse Act of 1884" as a governing piece of legislation that authorizes the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-releases-new-regulations-for-deductible-business-repairs/">IRS to regulate</a> </span>thousands of independent tax preparers, according to Reuters. Rothenberg explained that in the years following the Civil War, many Americans submitted war loss claims to the government for lost or missing horses. This led to the emergence of unregulated agents who would represent and lobby for these individuals for a fee. Over time, many agents began inflating both claim values and fees, which led to the government passing legislation to regulate intermediaries, Rothenberg concluded.

He explained that this scenario largely mirrors what could occur in present time if tax preparers are permitted to work without government oversight or be required to to pass a competency test and take annual continuing education classes. However, the Institute for Justice, which opposes the IRS law, argued that "representatives" and "service providers" do not fall under the same classification, and that tax preparers merely provide a paid service to clients.

"Preparing a tax return is not a representative act," said Dan Alban, a representative for the institute, according to Reuters. "It is performing a service, certainly, but there's no representation."

The three appellate judges hearing the case seemed to agree, and peppered Rothenberg with questions about the scope and history of this law, according to Politico. However, the court is not expected to reach a ruling for some time, as arguments over whether independent tax preparers should face stricter regulations will continue for the next several months.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A 2.6 billion dollar tax deficiency is likely to attract a lot of attention. The late William Davidson was a successful business man, owner of privately-held Guardian Industries, the Detroit Pistons and Tampa Bay Lightning. It appears that the decedent made substantial gifts of property but did not file gift<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/report-irs-to-increase-audits-of-prior-and-subsequent-year-tax-returns/">tax returns</a></span>. Some of the gifts were characterized as being made by the decedent’s spouse and that is being contested. Also, IRS contends the gifts were not properly valued. For all of these reasons, IRS assessed a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law/">gift tax</a> </span>deficiency of $880 million.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/a-2-6-billion-dollar-tax-bill-the-estate-of-davidson-and-cca-2013-033" rel="attachment wp-att-3560"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3560" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-bill-davidson.jpg" alt="tax bill" width="255" height="213" /></a>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a> </span>deficiency is $1.8 billion. It comes as no surprise that a substantial issue is valuation. Closely-held assets pose considerable difficulty in valuation and often wind-up as a battle of experts. In <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Davidson</span></i>, however, valuation has collateral consequences because the taxpayer utilized Self-Cancelling Installment Notes (SCINs).

First, we need to understand a SCIN. In a SCIN, the buyer purchasing the asset pays a premium for the feature that cancels the note at the death of the seller. The premium is either in form of a higher interest rate or a larger principal amount in the Note. Most SCINs call for a large balloon payment of principal on the Note at the end of the term. Thus, SCINs are beneficial if the seller dies (or is expected to die) before the end of the Note term.

I mentioned the collateral consequences of valuation. The IRS expressed its litigating position, in CCA 2013-033, that it will apply the willing buyer and seller standard to SCIN transactions, a position never before expressed. If a (SCIN) Note is worth less than fair market value of the assets sold, then the assets sold have been under-valued at the sale. The argument is that the Note being undervalued is indirect proof that the assets are undervalued.

There is another issue and that is whether the Note is bona fide and re-payment is expected. In<i> Costanza,</i> a notable SCIN case, the buyer (son) was able to make payments out of cash flow to the seller (father) who needed and expected payments that were the source of his retirement income. It is unclear in <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Davidson</span></i> whether the necessary payments could be or would be made, given the asset values. The cash needed for repayment does not always match the actual cash flow which is why there is a temptation to under-value assets.

Hopefully, the Court will decide what method is appropriate for determining the mortality premium. IRS suggests the Tables under §72 (Annuities), while planners see Table 90CM under Section 7520. There are others who believe the Note is an installment sale note eligible to use the Applicable Federal Rate under §1274. Some advisors have remarked that the IRS actuaries have used the AFR rates.

There are other issues, most notably the reliance upon specific tables where the likelihood of surviving one year is less than 50%. In Rev. Rul. 80-80, the test used was “so remote as to be negligible,” however, this ruling was declared obsolete. In <i>Davidson</i>, there are factual issues as to the decedent’s health prompted by many transfers occurring shortly before death.

IRS has the ability to assess a penalty of 20% if assets are substantially undervalued by a taxpayer. Unfortunately, there is no penalty that can be assessed against the Service if its valuations are overstated so the Service is encouraged to litigate by asserting penalties.

We expect to learn what is the appropriate table or methodology to value a SCIN if the case goes to trial and an opinion is rendered. While bad facts make bad law, the absence of timely filings and the flurry of activity nearer to death put the taxpayer in a difficult position.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service needs to improve or update the strategies it uses to estimate the federal tax gap, according to a recent report conducted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/report-irs-needs-to-reevaluate-tax-gap-estimate/tax-gap/" rel="attachment wp-att-3568"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3568" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-gap.jpg" alt="tax gap" width="257" height="214" /></a>The TIGTA analysis argued that the IRS needs to work on the comprehensiveness, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the tax gap estimate, particularly as lawmakers and government officials make key determinations about the state of the economy, existing<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a> </span>and potential changes that should be made. The tax gap estimate - which is defined as the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid voluntarily and on time - is commonly factored into decisions about federal funding, making it critical that the IRS provide accurate and timely information. The agency's most recent gap estimate is $450 billion for tax year 2006.

"Measuring the tax gap is both complex and challenging," said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. "However, I am concerned about the overall accuracy of the estimate."

The report highlighted several areas that were effectively included in the estimates, such as the informal economy and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">offshore accounts</a></span>. The former relates to areas of the economy that are not properly monitored or governed. The agency has attempted in recent months to impose more regulations on this potentially lucrative sector, and has introduced new laws regarding the reporting of tips and other cash transactions.

The IRS has also launched a comprehensive campaign to curb offshore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/oecd-announces-plan-for-tax-evasion-reduction/">tax evasion</a></span> and strengthen collection efforts. In addition to forging international agreements with foreign governments, the agency has expanded its Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program and initiated several investigations into financial institutions believed to have aided Americans in hiding income from the IRS.

As the federal tax agency faces sizable budget cuts in several key areas of operations, it is unclear how it will respond to TIGTA's recommendations to update its tax gap estimate strategies.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service is not immune to the far-reaching <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/what-does-the-government-shutdown-mean-for-new-york-and-new-jersey-businesses/">effects of the government shutdown</a>, and many key services and responsibilities may be delayed or temporarily suspended.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-audits-suspended-in-light-of-government-shutdown" rel="attachment wp-att-3574"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3574" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/government-shutdown.jpg" alt="government shutdown" width="247" height="244" /></a>Existing tax law requires that the federal agency continue to collect payments, interest, and penalties, regardless of whether the government is functioning at full capacity. However, those individuals or small businesses that are currently undergoing an audit will receive a reprieve until normal operations resume. Similar to other governing and regulatory bodies, many of the agency's staff are now furloughed. Of the 94,516 active IRS employees, 87,764 were furloughed during the shutdown with a little more than 8,752 "essential" employees remaining to manage the critical operations, the Huffington Post reports. This is a staff reduction of roughly 90 percent.

However, auditors do not anticipate that the reprieve will last for a long period, so those facing inquiries from the IRS are encouraged to continue working with their certified public accountant,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax attorney</a></span>, or other professionals to make progress on their case. In fact, Forbes noted that if the shutdown exceeds five days, the agency may be forced to reevaluate its needs to continue collection efforts.

The IRS has faced massive pressure as of late regarding the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/report-irs-needs-to-reevaluate-tax-gap-estimate/">growing tax gap</a></span>, which is estimated to be $450 billion. In response, collection efforts have been increased, namely in the form of audits, international agreements to curb <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/offshore-tax-haven-report/">offshore tax evasions</a></span>, stricter reporting requirements, and an expansion of the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program. Several Swiss institutions, such as Wegelin &amp; Co., have agreed to pay penalties and fines to the U.S. for helping American account holders skirt reporting requirements and evade tax law. Wegelin, Switzerland's oldest private banking institution, paid $57 million to the IRS for its complicity in these crimes.]]></content>

However, the IRS is also increasing its focus on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">small business tax practices</a></span>, even if the potential for recovering sizable payments is small, a new analysis reveals.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-increases-scrutiny-of-small-businesses" rel="attachment wp-att-3578"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3578" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/small-businesses-irs.jpg" alt="small businesses" width="232" height="232" /></a>IRS and Justice Department representatives recently spoke at the American Bar Association Sections of Taxation and Real Property Fall CLE Meeting, during which time they affirmed that federal tax agencies are taking on a higher share of smaller criminal employment tax cases, Bloomberg Law reports. Employment violations by small businesses range from failure to make Medicare and Social Security payments to misclassifying employees as independent contractors. Panelists theorized that larger corporations have sufficient resources and legal support to ensure maximum<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/labor-and-employment-law/">compliance with employment tax laws</a></span>. However, they noted that smaller companies with fewer financial, tax and legal support may be more likely to commit employment missteps.

"Often you will see an employer who has a course of conduct over quite a long period of time," Margaret Leigh Kessler, assistant chief of the Western Criminal Enforcement Section, Tax Division at the Department of Justice, told Bloomberg. "They are taking aggressive action to actively hide assets once the IRS has determined they are not complying with their employment tax obligations [and] they're lying to the IRS, who is looking into their employment tax."

According to a separate report in Businessweek, the IRS recommended roughly 3,700 prosecutions for various employment law violations for the year ending September 2012. The analysis also suggests that certain sectors are more likely to be audited than others - such as construction contractors and real estate rental agents - which are more likely to attract federal tax agencies' attention.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many affluent Americans and business owners who may be subject to federal state estate taxes focus a great deal of attention on understanding their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">obligations under tax law</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law/">utilizing gift tax allowances</a></span>, and establishing wealth management plans that will help lower their liability. However, a recent analysis indicates that too few individuals give the same attention to the estate taxes they may be required to pay by their state.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/affluent-urged-to-focus-on-state-estate-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-3585"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3585" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/state-estate-taxes.jpg" alt="state estate taxes" width="286" height="197" /></a>In a recent Wall Street Journal column, wealth manager Michael Foltz noted that after lawmakers raised the federal estate tax exemption to $5.25 million and announced that the exemption between spouses is portable, most households will not be required to pay federal estate taxes. However, some may fail to prepare themselves adequately for state estate taxes, which vary largely across the U.S. Currently, 21 states and the District of Columbia impose taxes on residents' estates, and some are significantly higher than others and may carry top rates as high as 16 percent.

For instance, New York carries a $1 million exemption, whereas New Jersey's exemption is only $675,000. This means that New York resident with a $5.25 million exemption would escape federal taxes, but be required to pay roughly $420,800 in estate taxes to the state, Forbes notes. In addition to estate taxes, six states levy an inheritance tax, the rate of which varies by who is inheriting the assets. For instance, Maryland imposes an estate tax of up to 16 percent above a $1 million exemption, and a 10 percent inheritance tax on every dollar left to a niece, nephew, or friend. However, no inheritance tax is levied against funds left to children, grandchildren, parents, or siblings.

It's important that individuals understand all of the potential liabilities they may face - both local, state, and federal - when managing their wealth in order to establish a more comprehensive plan.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In the State of New Jersey, unpaid municipal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/commercial-real-estate/">real estate taxes</a></span> result in a lien against the real property. These tax liens have a priority over other liens and mortgages, which is why lenders insist upon paying real estate taxes in order to maintain priority. After a year or so, the municipality advertises a sale and then sells these liens at auction to the public. The successful bidder is entitled to receive 8% on the first $1,500 and 18% interest on the excess. Immediately, one realizes that there are not many investments with that yield.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/new-jersey-real-estate-tax-liens-and-bid-rigging" rel="attachment wp-att-3591"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3591" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/real-estate.jpg" alt="real estate" width="256" height="212" /></a>Before the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008, a successful bidder for a tax lien would foreclose upon the lien after two years and then sell the property. Foreclosing, taking title and reselling the property became more lucrative than just owning liens because of the strong real estate re-sale market. New investors came to bid and prices declined and, in some cases, bids came in at a premium. A bid for a $5,000 tax lien may come in at $5,500 because the bidder could still make money although the yield would be less than 18%. The bidder hoped that the foreclosure would produce large windfalls, justifying the premium.  There were Wall Street funds that were formed and entered into this market in the hope of profiting from the foreclosures. These funds drove up the prices bid, thereby driving down overall returns.

What can go wrong, aside from increased competition?

The owner may fail to pay a subsequent quarterly year’s taxes and another tax lien may arise. The previous bidder must either pay the taxes or risk another party gaining title to the property. The owner may fail to pay his or her mortgage resulting in the lender’s foreclosure action before the lien holder can foreclose. The successive bidder may encounter delays in the foreclosure process, which is, typically, two years or more. The property owner could file bankruptcy and further impede the lien holder.  The foregoing does not compare to the havoc caused by the real estate market crash in 2008.   One such business which held many liens and foreclosed properties was placed under the jurisdiction of the court and a partner of mine was appointed to wind-up its affairs. The decline in real property values made foreclosure futile and there was insufficient cash flow to pay real estate taxes and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/unpaid-federal-taxes-lead-to-federal-tax-liens/">defend against new tax liens</a></span>.

The result for some was to lessen the intensity of the competition by rigging bids. My economics professor, the late Dr. Paul Nadler, remarked that the only group with the courage to defend free enterprise system and open markets are economics professors with tenure; all others look for an advantage.

It comes as no surprise that some bidders would resort to collusion.  Guilty pleas to big rigging charges, entered in Federal District Court in Newark, by two individuals bringing the number of guilty pleas entered for similar charges to fourteen. Big rigging reduced the premiums paid to the municipalities which had benefitted from the competition for these liens.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to explore whether companies and employees must pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/fica-taxation-of-severance-pay-may-remain-thorny-issue-due-to-conflicting-rulings/">(FICA) taxes on severance compensation</a></span>. The results of the ruling could force the U.S. Department of Treasury to pay out roughly $1 billion in tax refund claims. <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/supreme-court-to-determine-whether-severance-pay-is-taxable" rel="attachment wp-att-3597"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3597" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/severance-pay.jpg" alt="severance pay" width="267" height="218" /></a>

The case centers around a dispute between bankrupt Quality Stores Inc. and the Internal Revenue Service. The company, which went under in 2001 and closed all 300 of its stores, was forced to lay off 3,100 workers. However, Quality Stores made severance payments to each laid-off worker and paid FICA taxes on the amounts. In 2002, the company claimed a $1.1 million refund with the IRS for the taxes paid, arguing that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/court-upholds-ruling-that-fica-taxes-do-not-apply-to-severance-pay/">severance payments do not count as wages</a></span>, and are therefore not subject to payroll taxes.

Employers and employees each pay 6.2 percent in Social Security taxes on wages, and some of the refund money - if awarded - will go to employees, who allowed the company to lobby for the funds on their behalf. The IRS disagreed with the claims and refused to distribute refunds. "The severance payments at issue here are clearly 'wages' for FICA purposes," the government said in an August filing, according to Reuters. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law case</a></span> is particularly important, as Americans continue to be laid off and may be unsure of their tax obligations when it comes to severance, paid-out PTO days, and bonuses. The IRS currently defines wages broadly to include compensation for services of any type for FICA tax purposes, Bloomberg notes.

Therefore, if the Supreme Court chooses to place restrictions on this law, the Treasury Department may face a barrage of refund claims from companies and employees who previously made FICA payments on severance packages after being laid off.]]></content>

New research indicates which states may be more favorable to companies seeking to avoid corporate taxes and other major tax types.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-foundation-unveils-top-state-business-tax-climates" rel="attachment wp-att-3601"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3601" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/business-tax.jpg" alt="business tax" width="271" height="203" /></a>The Tax Foundation recently published the findings of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-begins-crackdown-of-small-businesses/">State Business Tax Climate</a></span> Index, which listed Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nevada as the top three states with a favorable business climate. This is largely because none of these states currently impose a corporate <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/may-a-trust-avoid-the-3-8-income-tax-surcharge/">tax liability or individual income tax</a></span>. This may give companies more financial flexibility and free up consumer income for spending.

However, a number of states - primarily those located in the Northeast region of the country - placed on the bottom of the list as the most unfavorable locations for businesses, namely as a result of high top rates and complex, non-neutral taxes that hinder a state's economic competitiveness. These states include Connecticut, Vermont, New Jersey and New York.

"The evidence shows that states with the best tax systems will be the most competitive in attracting new businesses and most effective at generating economic and employment growth," the Foundation noted. "Furthermore, unlike changes to a state's healthcare, transportation, or education systems which can take decades to implement changes to the tax code can quickly improve a state's business climate."

Scott Drenkard, an economist with the foundation, said that the data may help spark conversations with policymakers about what is working and what is not, with regard to their tax codes.The study is primarily used as a barometer that allows lawmakers and policy analysts to compare their state tax polices with others, and make key decisions that may improve their competitiveness. The data may become especially important as more municipalities face budgetary shortfalls, pension issues, and other financial obstacles that have prompted many to seek municipal bankruptcy protection.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/will-new-tax-strategy-become-more-widely-adopted" rel="attachment wp-att-3609"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3609" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-strategy.jpg" alt="tax strategy" width="257" height="167" /></a>For instance, the Financial Times recently highlighted a practice implemented by Google, which allowed it to funnel roughly $11.91 billion in royalty payments to a shell corporation in Bermuda in 2012, a 25 percent increase from the amount transferred in 2011. The strategy - commonly called the Dutch Sandwich - involves a company selling or licensing its foreign rights to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sports-and-entertainment-law/intellectual-property-and-technology-law/">intellectual property developed in the United States</a></span> to a subsidiary in a country with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-issues-that-impact-your-wealthpart-iv-interest-rates/">lower tax rates</a></span>, Bloomberg explained. In doing so, foreign profits are then attributed to that offshore subsidiary rather than the U.S., greatly reducing the company's tax liabilities.

In the case of Google, the company lowers its overseas tax rate to roughly 5 percent, less than half the rate in already low-tax Ireland. However, the move has also sparked controversy over the practice, namely because Google earns most of its foreign income in Ireland and does not pay substantial taxes in other countries. In addition to this set-up, the company moves most of its profits from Ireland to Bermuda, choosing to route the funds through the Netherlands to avoid withholding taxes, the Times added.

It is unclear how many U.S. companies have adopted this strategy, but a number of large corporations, including Facebook, Microsoft, and Starbucks have all come under fire for their controversial tax strategies. However, many analysts argue that while they may be complex, they are currently legal under U.S. tax law. This assertion may come under dispute by the IRS, however, which has said it will take a more detailed look into corporate tax strategies.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[An estate may, in certain circumstances, elect to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/a-2-6-billion-dollar-tax-bill-the-estate-of-davidson-and-cca-2013-033/">pay estate tax in a series of payments</a></span> over a number of years. This election is available to estates in which assets are used in an active trade or business comprise more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the estate. Payment of estate tax can be extended over a ten-year term with the first payment delayed for five (5) years.  This election enables small businesses to continue after the death of the owner.

What can go wrong?

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/pay-estate-tax-over-time" rel="attachment wp-att-3614"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3614" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pay-estate-tax-300x231.jpg" alt="pay estate tax" width="276" height="212" /></a>In (Estate of) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S</span>., the estate deferred payment of estate tax over ten years. A hotel comprised $11.5m of value in an estate of $16m. The estate paid installments for the proportion of estate tax attributable to the hotel in the years 1996 to 2006 and represents. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-foundation-unveils-top-state-business-tax-climates/">Estate tax on non-business assets</a></span> such as a residence, stocks and bonds, is not deferred

In 2002, the hotel went bankrupt after the estate paid $5.0m of the deferred tax, leaving about $1.8m outstanding. The estate defaulted on the payment plan and the government filed suit on the grounds of transferee liability §6324(a).

In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson</span>, a revocable living trust held four partnerships, one for each child. The trustees distributed the partnerships, not the estate. Transferee liability is based upon receiving property, on or after date of death, that was included in the gross estate. The beneficiaries claimed they weren’t transferees because they did not receive the property from the decedent’s estate. The trustees admitted they were transferees but claimed the action was time barred. The trustees also claimed that they were not liable for the tax because the estate had enough money at the time of death.

The court held the deferral agreement tolled the statute of limitations and the government could pursue the trustees and the beneficiaries as transferees.

One of the many issues in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">deferral of estate tax liability</a></span> is the obligations of the fiduciaries and beneficiaries to one another.  In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estate</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turco,</span> the court-appointed administrator sought to recover proceeds of life insurance payable to trusts and use those proceeds to pay tax that was deferred. In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turco</span>, the decline in real estate values was also the cause of the inability to pay.

The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turco</span> cases demonstrate what can go wrong.

Clearly, business conditions can impact the ability to pay and upset expectations of the parties.  What if the business is left to one beneficiary and other assets (stocks, insurance, IRAs) are left to other beneficiaries?  There is a bit of dilemma in planning the estate plan.  Do you leave the business to the beneficiary with the aptitude for it but subject the other beneficiaries to the economic risks?  Look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turco</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson</span>, the crash in the real estate market prevented repayment of deferred estate tax. On the other hand, is there enough in the way of liquid assets to pay the estate tax. Where does that leave the other beneficiaries, in terms of an inheritance, if the liquid assets pay the taxes.

The hard work is not making the election.  Instead, it lies behind the scenes in dealing with the potential issues.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Following the announcement of several international tax agreements and a higher level of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/will-new-tax-strategy-become-more-widely-adopted">scrutiny over corporate tax strategies</a>,</span> Ireland recently announced its plans to close a tax loophole that a number of companies - most notably Apple, Inc. - have used to significantly lower their tax liabilities.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/ireland-announces-plan-to-close-apples-tax-loophole" rel="attachment wp-att-3621"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3621" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-loophole.jpg" alt="tax loophole" width="272" height="181" /></a>Ireland's Department of Finance released a new report detailing its 2014 international tax strategies, in which it declared a "change to our company residence rules aimed at eliminating mismatches - that can exist between tax treaty partners in certain circumstances - being used to allow companies to be 'stateless' in terms of their place of tax residence."

Currently, Apple runs all of its non-US income through two Irish companies, one of which is classified as a tax resident and domiciled in Ireland. The other, however, is not domiciled or considered a tax resident anywhere. Apple is then able to avoid paying roughly $40 billion in taxes by funneling money into the first Irish company, and then passing the funds over as royalties and fees to the second, which is not subject to any national tax jurisdiction, Forbes explained. Ireland's new rule will make it illegal for any company registered in the country to maintain that "stateless" status to avoid taxes.

However, closing the loophole does not necessarily mean corporations will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">required by law to pay higher taxes</a></span>. In fact, many analysts agreed that nothing would likely change. Although Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said that the country will close the loophole, it will keep in place a provision that enables corporations to nominate any country they prefer as their tax residence, according to Reuters. This includes popular zero tax jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, which is a prime choice for companies such as Google, Amazon, and other tech giants.]]></content>

Frey will be the second bank - following Wegelin and Co. - to close after allegations of helping Americans <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">evade U.S. tax law</a>.</span>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/private-swiss-bank-closes-over-tax-evasion-dispute-with-u-s" rel="attachment wp-att-3628"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3628" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-evasion-dispute.jpg" alt="tax evasion dispute" width="261" height="206" /></a>U.S. authorities have launched an investigation into several Swiss institutions for their complicity in tax law violations. A government program currently exists that enables Swiss institutions to voluntarily come forward and detail their actions in exchange for reduced penalty rates. Under the agreement, participating banks are required to disclose the amount of undeclared American assets on their books and pay related penalties. However, Frey is one of the 14 institutions ineligible for the program because it is already under investigation by the Department of Justice, Reuters reports.

Although Frey has not been indicted by the Justice Department, shareholders for the institution noted that increased regulatory scrutiny - and the costs associated with compliance - are too burdensome for the small bank. In addition, U.S. authorities have indicted Stefan Buck, the bank's former head of private banking, for allegedly assisting Americans in hiding taxable income from the Internal Revenue Service, according to the Wall Street Journal.

"As a result of developments in recent years, circumstances and challenges have presented themselves, especially in Switzerland, that mean it no longer makes sense for a small bank to continue its cross-border services," said Markus Frey, chairman of the board who founded the institution in 2000. "Bank Frey will therefore cease its operative business activities as a bank."

Several Swiss institutions are currently under investigation for similar violations. The increased scrutiny is due in large part to the IRS's attempt to close the multibillion-dollar tax gap, which the IRS estimates to be $385 billion.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[An Ohio man appeared in court seeking to reverse the 1994 declaration of his death. The declaration of death (“Declaration”) resulted from his disappearance from his home eight years earlier. Ohio law prevents a court from reversing such a Declaration after three years from its entry. The Ohio man is seeking to reclaim his social security number in order to obtain his driver’s license and sought reversal of the Declaration in order to do so. The man’s former wife objected to the reversal of the Declaration because their children received <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/bezos-may-have-trouble-securing-tax-benefits-with-wapo/">Social Security benefits</a></span> as the result of their father’s death. These amounts would have to be repaid and now there are insufficient funds to do so.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-planning-for-the-undead" rel="attachment wp-att-3633"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3633" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-planning.jpg" alt="tax planning" width="279" height="186" /></a>There are so many things that follow in taxation that follow as a consequence of death. The consequences and complications of a reversal of a Declaration are incalculable.

Suppose an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/new-jersey-real-estate-tax-liens-and-bid-rigging/">estate tax return</a></span> was filed and a QTIP election was made. Would the rebirth of the decedent obviate the tax return or would the Declaration make this a valid testamentary QTIP as of the time of the election? If the Declaration were reversed caused the How does one deal with the Deceased Spouse Unused Exclusion Amount and portability?

In the Ohio case, the wife was accorded the unmarried status as the result of the Declaration. If the Declaration were reversed and she had already re-married, who is her spouse? Would she be prevented from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">filing joint income tax returns</a></span> with her current husband?  Is bigamy an issue?

Imagine the uncertainty resulting from the Declaration in Generation Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) context. Suppose the Ohio man’s father or mother died and his share of their estate passed in trust to the grandchildren. The predeceased ancestor rule would have moved the grandchildren up a generation because of the Declaration. What would happen if the Declaration is reversed if no GST exemption were allocated to the trust? Would all future distributions to the grandchildren become taxable transfers?

Consider the passing of property under a Will or intestacy. Would a claim arise for the return of the property from a recipient? If the man owned property or partnerships that distributed cash during the eight-year absence and post declaration of death, would the man be entitled to receive an accounting or return of the distributions? If there were mortgages, bank loans and personal guarantees, how does one rearrange history.

The period of time that must elapse before a declaration of death may be declared varies by state; however, it is easy to understand why it is five or more years in most states. The old saying is that the only certainties are death and taxes. Obviously, that is not so in this case.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/sec-clears-apple-tax-practices" rel="attachment wp-att-3638"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3638" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tax-practices.jpg" alt="tax practices" width="237" height="357" /></a>According to Forbes, the <a href="/ireland-announces-plan-to-close-apples-tax-loophole/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEC has given Apple the green ligh</span>t</a> to continue utilizing its existing tax strategies and even wrote a letter to affirm that the company's financial and tax maneuvering fall in line with generally accepted accounting practices. This includes the use of the so-called "Double Irish and the Dutch Sandwich," which has made headlines recently as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/will-new-tax-strategy-become-more-widely-adopted/">controversial tax strategy</a>.</span>

Under this method - which has been used by behemoths such as Google, Facebook, and Hewlett Packard - companies set up Irish and Dutch subsidiary companies in low- or no-tax jurisdictions. They can then funnel profits through the first Irish subsidiary to the Dutch company, and then back to a second Irish subsidiary which sends the profits to a tax haven. Google was able to funnel roughly $12 million in royalty payments to Bermuda last year - 25 percent more than in 2011 - and reduce its overseas tax rate to about five percent. Now that Apple has been cleared for similar methods, it's speculated that more corporations may follow suit.

For instance, Twitter is expected to adopt this tax practice in the future, as it has recently set up an international company "Twitter International Company" in Ireland, according to Daily Gadgetry. Rather than paying the 35 percent corporate tax rate if the company funneled profits back to the U.S., Twitter could end up paying a significantly lower rate in Ireland. However, it would still be subject to the 35 percent rate if it decided to repatriate profits to the U.S.

Although more tax law cases are emerging that call corporate strategies into question, new legislation prohibiting long-established practices has yet to be introduced.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The 16-day <a href="/irs-audits-suspended-in-light-of-government-shutdown/">government shutdown officially came to an end</a> last week, but many federal agencies are still overcoming the effects of furloughs and stunted projects that cost the economy an estimated $24 billion. The Internal Revenue Service is one of the federal branches trying to play catch up, and the delays it experienced during the shutdown have prompted it to <a href="/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season/">postpone the beginning of the 2014 tax season</a>, an official recently announced.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/government-shutdown-prompts-irs-to-delay-start-of-tax-season" rel="attachment wp-att-3643"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3643" alt="tax season" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tax-season-300x231.jpg" width="238" height="183" /></a>Acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said that the agency, which was originally slated to begin tax season on Jan. 21, will hold off on processing any and all applications until at least Jan. 28 or Feb. 4 at the very latest. However, American taxpayers and business owners will still be required comply with existing <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law deadlines</a> and file their documents by April 15, or face penalties and interest. The delay is due in large part to the government shutdown, which forced the IRS to furlough roughly 90 percent of its workforce and abandon key processes that are critical to readying the agency for the 2014 tax season.

More specifically, the IRS noted that it is running three weeks behind, and needs more time to program and test the tax processing systems responsible for managing the more than 150 million returns it receives each year. Without proper testing, delays and errors are more likely to occur. This alone could cause problems with issuing refunds in a timely manner or lead to calculations errors on the part of the IRS.

"Readying our systems to handle the tax season is an intricate, detailed process, and we must take the time to get it right," said Werfel. "The adjustment to the start of the filing season provides us the necessary time to program, test and validate our systems so that we can provide a smooth filing and refund process for the nation's taxpayers. We want the public and tax professionals to know about the delay well in advance so they can prepare for a later start of the filing season."]]></content>

However, <a href="/new-laws-clamp-down-on-employee-misclassifications/">misclassification of workers</a> comes with a number of federal and state penalties, which include fines, tax payments, interest and, in more severe cases, legal action.

Many states suffering from budget constraints have now taken a more proactive approach toward discovering and penalizing that companies that skirt their tax obligations through mislabeling workers, especially as these crimes cost states millions in potential tax revenue. For instance, Connecticut conducted a 12-month audit of its construction sector, which prompted it to reclassify 3,487 workers and uncover $68.2 million in unreported payroll, representing $1.3 million in lost payroll taxes, Bloomberg reported. Earlier in 2013, New York officials announced that an investigation found 20,200 instances of workers treated as contractors in 2012, representing more than $282.5 million in unreported wages, the news source added.

As states come to realize the prevalence of this problem across a number of industries, more are introducing or updating worker misclassification laws to curb the issue and strengthen their ability to prosecute companies. One issue that some employers find is that the guidelines that govern worker classification can be hazy, making it difficult to determine whether the employee or contractor status applies.

With more states investigating companies and the job market growing, companies that are uncertain of how to classify individuals might benefit from consulting a legal professional. Gaining a firmer understanding of state and federal rules may help lower the risk of tax issues in the future.]]></content>

"People are so angry and so poor," Nikolis Geniatakis, a restaurant owner Archanes, Greece, told The New York Times after observing tax collectors visiting neighboring restaurants in search of receipts and financial records. "What were the tax inspectors doing here? Why aren't they going after the big fish?"

Among the major concerns for Greek residents is whether or not the country's newly enacted tax laws have allowed authorities to reduce the amount of tax evasion and recoup lost funds.

Over recent years, Greek residents have sustained increases in taxation and social security contribution deductions. In a report by the European Commission on the European labor market, researchers revealed that, in 2012, the total tax on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_29/10/2013_525326">salaries for Greeks grew by 7.2 percent</a>,</span> which was the highest in the eurozone, ekathimerini reported.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/report-irs-contract-workers-owe-5-4m-in-back-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-3658"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3658" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/back-taxes-293x300.jpg" alt="back taxes" width="224" height="227" /></a>"The IRS takes tax compliance for taxpayers and those who work for the IRS very seriously," the IRS said in a statement. "For an IRS employee, failure to timely pay one's full federal tax liability is considered misconduct, which may result in discipline or removal."

According to The Associated Press, more than half of the contractors should be ineligible to work for the IRS because they are currently not enrolled in installment plans to cover the taxes owed.

The IRS is unique among federal agencies because it requires all of its 90,000 employees <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">specializing in tax law</a> - as well as those working on agency contracts - to be compliant with federal tax laws. As a result, staff and contractors alike are responsible for filing returns on time, the news source noted.

Those who do owe taxes are required to pay the total amount owed, or enroll in payment plans. The agency attests that it vigorously monitors the tax compliance of employees, as well as contractors.

An earlier report released on Oct. 22 found that the IRS issues between <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/23/inspector-general-hits-irs-with-two-new-reports/">$11.6 billion to $13.6 billion in improper earned-income tax credits</a></span> in 2012, The Washington Post reported.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[One of the irritating aspects of the Internal Revenue Code is the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">complexity its tax law interactions</a></span> and its various provisions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BMC</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Software</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inc</span>. v <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comm</span>., 141 TC No. 5 (2013) illustrates this point. <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/bmc-software-the-complexity-of-the-code" rel="attachment wp-att-3663"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3663" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bmc-software-irs.jpg" alt="bmc software" width="254" height="178" /></a>BMC and its European Holding Company entered into a cost sharing arrangement (“CSA”) to develop computer software.

Later, in 2002, BMC took sole ownership of the software. The <a href="/irs-scores-13-million-victory-against-bmc-software/">IRS audited the CSA and increased the income of BMC Software</a> by $102 million. BMC and IRS entered into a closing agreement, agreeing to that figure. Here is where the interaction of the various provisions of the Code provides some complex interactions. The increased income was the result of the adjustment to the royalty payments by BMC to its European Holding Company for its interest in the software. BMC had to make an adjustment to its accounting records.

One-half of the accounting adjustment reflects the increase to its income. BMC could have elected to treat the other half of the accounting adjustment as a contribution to capital or as an account receivable. BMC chose the later alternative and entered into another closing agreement with IRS for its choice. During the period, BMC repatriated $721m of dividends at a time when the IRC §965 temporary dividends received deduction (“TDRD”) was applicable. This temporary provision permitted BMC to deduct from its income 85% of the dividends received in excess of average indebtedness. The term <i>average indebtedness</i> was defined to be the average of indebtedness from October 3, 2004 to the date of BMC’s election to utilize the TDRD under §965. The TDRD was designed to encourage the repatriation of funds from overseas operations to the United States. The public policy goal was that the repatriated funds would spur job growth and capital investment. The increase in the amount of indebtedness created by the receivable constituted indebtedness for purposes of §965. This increase in total indebtedness for the testing period made average indebtedness a higher figure.

This higher average meant a lesser amount would qualify for TDRD. BMC argued that the account receivable was created in 2007, a year after repatriation in 2006 and therefore should not increase average indebtedness in 2006. The court rejected that argument and held the creation of the account receivable was for the years in the test period. BMC also argued that the related party debt rules §965(b)(3) were meant to apply to abusive situations only. This argument was also rejected. The result was a reduction in the TDRD by $36.9m and a tax increase of $12.9m. Two points are worth noting. First, the interaction of the various tax law provisions is complex. Although the TDRD expired, we suspect others will find this case to be a reason not to repatriate funds. Second, our tax system encourages those companies with active businesses overseas to invest and reinvest through those foreign companies. Active income, in the most general terms, is not Subpart F income; therefore it is not subject to tax until repatriated. Looking at the economic opportunities around the world, it is easy to understand the tax reasons why funds are not repatriated.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Up to now, many firms could not conceive of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/gifts-should-be-a-crucial-part-of-your-business-succession-plan/">succession plan as being subject to ERISA</a></span>. Fortunately, the Fifth Circuit, in <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cantrell</span></i> v. <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Briggs</span></i> <i>&amp;</i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Veselka</span></i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span></i>., confirmed a 2-1 decision after a rehearing and held that deferred compensation provisions in two employment contracts did not <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/employee-benefits-erisa-group/">constitute a plan under ERISA</a></span>. This decision does not preclude the possibility of such a classification under a different set of facts or under the analysis of the dissent.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/is-your-shareholder-succession-plan-subject-to-erisa" rel="attachment wp-att-3667"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3667" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/succession-plan-300x260.jpg" alt="succession plan" width="236" height="204" /></a>There are several issues common to employment contracts and shareholder agreements, particularly non-compete and claw-back provisions designed to protect the employer from having to make payments to a former employee engaged in direct competition.

How does an employment contract with deferred compensation provisions rise to the level of an ERISA plan? Why would a litigant want ERISA status?

Carol Cantrell is an attorney and CPA, and a noted speaker and author on taxation. Eleven years earlier, Carol and her husband, Patrick Cantrell, also an attorney, merged their accounting practice into <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Briggs</span></i> <i>&amp;</i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Veselka</span></i> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span></i>. (<i>Briggs</i>). The agreement called for a series of payments upon retirement (four times W-2 salary) payable over ten years and a small redemption payment for stock.

Her husband left the accounting firm of four years before she announced she was leaving <i>Briggs</i> to practice law with her husband. The <i>Briggs</i> firm terminated the husband’s payments and refused to pay her. The Cantrells sued in state court and <i>Briggs</i> sought to remove the litigation to federal court on the grounds that the deferred compensation arrangement was an ERISA plan.

Why would <i>Briggs</i> or anyone for that matter want ERISA to apply?

The answer is that, under ERISA, a plan administrator’s decision to pay or not pay claims is given a great deal of deference.

<i>Briggs</i> contended the plan was a “top hat” plan which meant the <i>Briggs</i> firm could act as the “decision maker” without violating ERISA.  29 U.S.C. 1101 (a) exempts top hat plans from oversight, reporting and fiduciary duties under ERISA and forfeiture of benefits for cause is a common provision. If federal law applied, the state law claims cannot be successfully asserted by Cantrell.

What would it take to become an ERISA plan? An ERISA plan would require the employer to engage in an ongoing administrative scheme that requires particularized administrative discretionary analysis. There are several factors that should be considered and firms should review their agreements to ascertain whether they are close to satisfying the requirements set out in this and other decisions. Qualifying for ERISA status would require additional administrative responsibility, a burden that many firms that have reluctant to accept or assumed did not apply.

The dissenting opinion in <i>Cantrell</i> stated that the ability to terminate an employee for cause was a sufficient administrative scheme to invoke ERISA. No doubt, this argument will be made again, perhaps in another circuit, by a firm seeking to terminate payments of deferred compensation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[NASCAR driver Juan Pablo Montoya is currently facing a series of <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law violations in the U.S. Tax Court</a>, for allegedly failing to pay nearly $3 million in federal taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-says-juan-pablo-montoya-owes-2-7-million-in-back-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-3672"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3672" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/back-taxes-montoya.jpg" alt="back taxes" width="285" height="184" /></a>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/pohlad-estate-brings-lawsuit-against-irs-over-189-million-tax-bill-regarding-minnesota-twins/">IRS recently filed a lawsuit</a> </span>against the driver, arguing that he did not disclose the accurate income he made in 2007 and 2008, according to an exclusive Forbes report. The agency further explained that Montoya made roughly $9.5 million in taxable income, but only reported $2.4 million. The IRS is seeking to recoup $2.7 million in back taxes, interest charges, and penalties.

However, the discrepancy may largely stem from issues that arose when Montoya - a Colombian native - transitioned to NASCAR and sought residency in the U.S., the news source explained. Under the counsel of advisors, the driver argues that he was encouraged to set up a limited liability company in the Bahamas, which was responsible for managing income earned from use of his name and likeness. Upon joining NASCAR and establishing residency in the U.S., he was then told to "domesticate his foreign assets to the U.S.," Forbes reported. Montoya claimed a number of deductions associated with transitioning a foreign company to a domestic company, which the IRS calls a "sham" strategy.

Montoya affirmed that he had $800,000 more in income than he reported on his tax returns during the years in question, but is disputing the remaining $2.7 million part of the IRS audit. At present, Montoya is not being charged with a crime.

In an interesting twist, Montoya is joining Penske Racing in 2014 to run in the IndyCar Series full-time with his future teammate Helio Castroneves, who was acquitted on felony tax charges in 2009. Overall, in 251 career Cup starts, Montoya has earned roughly $37,051,270.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-law-milestone-for-amazon" rel="attachment wp-att-3678"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3678" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sales-tax.jpg" alt="sales tax" width="249" height="245" /></a>In Massachusetts, Connecticut and Wisconsin, state lawmakers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">enacted tax laws</a></span> that break away from Amazon.com's previous non-tax collection policies. An estimated 163 million Americans from 16 states will be impacted as a result, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On Oct. 18, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/21/net-us-usa-tax-amazon-idUSBRE99K0T620131021">against a state law</a></span> that attempted to collect sales taxes from purchases made online. However, New York's high court ruled, in early 2013, in favor of the collection of sales taxes from online sales, Reuters reported.

Both rulings represent a divergence on a state level regarding tax laws, suggesting that this issue may come before the Supreme Court in the imminent future.

"There will continue to be additional litigation at the state level exacerbating the problem," Stephen Kranz, a partner at law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery, told the news source. "That is clear and should be a factor considered by the court in deciding whether to take the New York or Illinois case."

Amazon's tax-free status has been interpreted by some experts as crucial for giving the online retailer an advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers, the Wall Street Journal reported.]]></content>

<a title="By AgnosticPreachersKid (Own work) [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ATreasury_Department_WDC.JPG"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Treasury_Department_WDC.JPG/512px-Treasury_Department_WDC.JPG" alt="Treasury Department WDC" width="512" /></a>Many foreign banks, investment firms and other financial agencies have expressed some concern over the lack of clarity and guidance provided by the U.S. that is essential for helping them comply, and the Treasury Department's most recent instruction is designed to help these institutions <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">avoid penalties under the tax law</a></span>. For instance, the guidance provides a draft agreement for participating institutions directly engaging in agreements with the Internal Revenue Service and those reporting through a intergovernmental agreement. The notice also provides foreign institutions with advance notice prior to the beginning of FATCA withholding and account due diligence requirements on July 1, 2014.

"The agreement and forthcoming guidance have been designed to minimize administrative burdens and related costs for foreign financial institutions and withholding agents," said Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack. "Today's preview demonstrates the Administration's commitment to ensuring full global cooperation and a smooth implementation."

FATCA is designed to detect Americans who try to hide assets overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes. While most foreign institutions have announced their intent to participate in the new tax evasion initiative - or avoid being frozen out of U.S. financial markets - there has also been a great deal of frustration from institutions about the lack of timely guidance from the government. Many are concerned that they will inadvertently violate compliance guidelines, simply because they have not been given sufficient information. Foreign institutions that fail to comply with the law face a potential 30 percent withholding tax on their U.S. income, which could greatly jeopardize their global standing and ability to enter into meaningful financial agreements with other countries.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Flexible spending accounts have historically been less popular with Americans than health savings accounts, due to a "use it or lose it" provision that requires account holders to forfeit any unused balances at the end of their plan year. However, a new adjustment to FSAs that was announced in October by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/treasury-reaches-final-agreement-with-ireland-on-anti-tax-evasion/">Treasury Department</a></span> and the IRS may change that.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/treasury-adjusts-fsa-use-it-or-lose-it-provision" rel="attachment wp-att-3687"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3687" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/flexible-spending-account.jpg" alt="flexible spending account" width="219" height="230" /></a>The government agency recently modified the forfeiture rule, and will now allow individuals to carry over up to $500 of their remaining balances at the end of the plan year. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">new tax law</a> </span>is designed to generate greater interest in these tax-advantaged plans, allow workers to keep a greater portion of their balances, and reduce unnecessary medical spending at the end of the year, the Treasury Department said.

Existing rules also give employers the option of allowing employees a grace period that permits them to use amounts remaining unused at the end of a year to pay qualified FSA expenses incurred for up to two and a half months following year-end. While this rule will remain in place, plan participants may not employ both a carryover and a grace period. They must choose one or the other.

"Across the administration, we are always looking for ways to provide added flexibility and commonsense solutions to how people pay for their healthcare," said Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. "Today's announcement is a step forward for hardworking Americans who wisely plan for health care expenses for the coming year."

According to the agency, roughly 14 million Americans participate in FSAs, and analysts are eager to see if the change will prompt an increase in participants. This is currently unclear, because employers are not required to adopt the new benefit and may continue with existing forfeiture rules if they wish. A large number of employers currently offer FSAs as a method of providing assistance to workers in covering qualifying out-of-pocket medical expenses, while also earning valuable tax breaks for the company.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/all-a-twitter-why-ipos-are-back/">Twitter's initial public offering</a> has been a boon for investors, but a <a href="/u-s-cayman-islands-reach-tax-deal/">tax deal agreement</a> the company negotiated with San Francisco may end up costing the city millions of dollars in the future.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/twitter-tax-break-deal-may-cost-san-francisco-millions" rel="attachment wp-att-3692"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3692" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/twitter.jpg" alt="twitter" width="240" height="257" /></a>Twitter recently forged a unique agreement with San Francisco, whereby the company would keep its headquarters in the city in exchange for lucrative payroll tax breaks. Currently, San Francisco is the only city in California that collects payroll taxes, according to the San Francisco Gate. An analysis conducted by certified public accountant Jim McHale - in collaboration with the Chronicle - revealed that San Francisco stands to lose roughly $34 million in revenue from stock grants alone that may be exercised and sold after the company's IPO.

Currently, the rising stock indicates that this scenario may become a reality, an ABC News report found.

"About 82 million shares of Twitter have exchanged hands already," the news source noted. "To put that in perspective, Twitter only sold 70 million shares in its IPO. One way to think about it, every share issued in Twitter's IPO has been traded more than once, and the session isn't half over yet."

Additionally, the city noted that that <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">payroll tax law agreement</a> struck with Twitter may cost them about $22 million over a six-year period without the IPO - or $56 million overall - leaving many analysts to wonder how revenue streams will be affected over the next several years.

Despite the potential losses, the San Francisco claims that it would have forfeited more revenue in the long run if the company had decided to relocate its headquarters to Palo Alto, Calif. Although the city stands to gain from keeping the company in its cross hairs, not all are on board with the deal.

"As technology companies like Twitter and Facebook seek to turn ideas into profits by going public and selling stock, they are also exploiting taxpayer subsidies for executive pay to avoid paying any taxes on billions of dollars of earnings," Think Progress columnist Alan Pyke wrote.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A federal judge granted a request made by government officials to obtain the account data and identifying information of American banking <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">clients suspected of committing tax law</a> <a href="/tax-agencies-in-u-s-u-k-and-australia-announce-partnership-to-target-offshore-accounts/">violations through offshore accounts</a></span> managed by the Bank of N.T. Butterfield &amp; Son.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/u-s-officials-granted-access-to-bank-records-in-tax-evasion-probe" rel="attachment wp-att-3698"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3698" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tax-evasion-probe-300x251.jpg" alt="tax evasion probe" width="261" height="217" /></a>Butterfield currently has several offices throughout the Caribbean and Switzerland, and officials have long suspected that certain American account holders have utilized their accounts to hide income and assets from the Internal Revenue Service. The special summonses granted by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman will require five U.S. banks - Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, and Bank of America - to provide financial information and details to federal officials about clients who may be evading their tax responsibilities through Butterfield.

As Butterfield does not operate within the U.S., tax officials will be required to obtain information through the five banks that manage correspondent accounts with the Caribbean-based financial institution. These correspondent accounts, which are common in the international banking system, enable foreign banks with no U.S. presence to work with U.S. institutions to carry out monetary transactions and perform services for their clients. Lately, however, officials have discovered that these accounts may also be abused and allow clients to shield income.

These so-called "John Doe" summonses have been a strategic tool in the U.S. Justice Department's search for Americans who are using offshore accounts to skirt their tax responsibilities. The summons was instrumental in a 2009 case against Swiss banking giant UBS, which eventually resulted in the institution agreeing to pay a $780 million settlement to avoid criminal prosecution for helping Americans evade their taxes.

"These John Doe summonses will provide information about individuals using financial institutions from Switzerland to the Cayman Islands to Hong Kong to avoid their U.S. tax obligations," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kathryn Keneally.]]></content>

The two countries have signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). IGAs have been instrumental in helping countries establish information-sharing procedures and processes that allow them to detect, investigate, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">prosecute potential tax evaders</a> </span>who have hidden taxable income in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/offshore-tax-haven-report/">offshore tax havens</a></span>. Under the IGA, financial institutions in France will be required to report tax information about U.S. account holders directly to the French government, which will in turn relay that information to the IRS. The IRS plans to reciprocate with similar information about French account holders.

According to the Treasury Department, 10 IGAs have been signed so far.

"France has been an enthusiastic supporter of our effort to promote <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/global-tax-evasion-compliance-deadline-nears/">global tax transparency</a></span> and critical to drafting a model of FATCA implementation," said Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack.  "This agreement demonstrates the growing global momentum behind FATCA and strong support from the world's most important economies."

Several other countries - including Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom - have also signed IGAs. Other countries, such as Japan and Switzerland, have also engaged in agreements to a lesser extent that will help facilitate information sharing and support FATCA. However, there is still a long way to go in encouraging more countries to cooperate with the new law, especially those who have regarded client confidentiality as a critical factor in attracting foreign customers. However, those that fail to comply with the provisions outlined in FATCA risk being frozen out of U.S. financial markets.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tina Turner rose to fame, in part, on the song <i>Proud Mary,</i> whose lyrics begin with: “Lookin’ for a job in the city.”

<a href="/tina-turner-longer-looking-job-city/" rel="attachment wp-att-3712"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3712" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Tina-Turner-Renounces-Citizenship-300x292.jpg" alt="Tina Turner relinquished her U.S. citizenship" width="240" height="234" /></a>Recently, the Washington Post announced that Tina Turner relinquished her U.S. citizenship.  Another publication stated that, for income tax purposes, there is a distinction between renouncing and relinquishing a person’s U.S. citizenship and that relinquishing has lesser adverse consequences.

<strong>Could that be true?</strong>

§877 and §877A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) were enacted to address the issue of expatriates and taxation.  In 1966, §877 was enacted; however, IRS had to prove the principal purpose was tax avoidance and the statute was ineffective and unenforceable. Amendments were made in 1996, as part of HIPPA, that expanded the scope of coverage to include long-term residents as well as citizens.   Second, IRS no longer had to prove motive.  Instead a presumption of tax avoidance was created that applied when certain income and net worth levels were met.  Third, U.S.-source income was more carefully defined and its scope was expanded.  Amendments were made to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax provisions</a></span> as well.  §877 taxed the individual for a period of ten years after departure.  In the years 1999-2004, numerous letter rulings were requested and issued on whether the individual overcame the presumption of tax avoidance.  A favorable ruling caused §877 not to apply, while an adverse ruling or a “no-decision” ruling left one subject to tax.

In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act modified the rules making them more objective, such as the elimination of the presumption and abolished ruling requests. Congress remained unsatisfied with §877. In 2008, Congress enacted §877A which imposed an exit tax calculated on a mark-to-market basis.  Stated another way, an expatriate is deemed to sell his or her assets for fair market value on the day before expatriation. The exit tax was designed to make tax-motivated expatriations prohibitively expensive.

Now, back to Ms. Turner, who has lived in Switzerland for over twenty years and married a Swiss resident.  To some, renunciation versus relinquishment may be a distinction without a difference.  One should note that the U.S.-Swiss Tax Treaty was entered into in 1997 after the 1996 amendments. That treaty and six others did not reserve to the U.S. the right former residents. A curious question is whether or not Ms Turner renounced her citizenship under §<i>349(9)(5) Immigration &amp; Nationality Act</i>.  She reportedly stated that she had no ties to the U.S. but may not have “renounced.”  An alternative to renunciation includes obtaining naturalization in a foreign state after age 18 and notifying the Department of State of such an act.  One report was Ms. Turner advised that she is a citizen and resident of a foreign county under a U.S treaty without waiver of benefits.

The curious part of all of this is whether she was able to convert her intangible assets into foreign sited assets under the tax treaty.  After all, she was a resident of Switzerland and intangibles are typically deemed sited where the individual is resident.

Determining when expatriation occurs is critical, especially with respect to the different versions of the statute and rules that may apply.

Ms. Turner is not the only person to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/what-facebook-expatriation-and-the-ex-patriot-act-have-in-common/">expatriate from the U.S</a>.</span>  We reported that Facebook co-founder, the Brazilian-born Edwardo Saverin, expatriated to Singapore in 2009.  His departure occurred well before the Facebook IPO, no doubt a strategic move, as his renunciation in 2011 saved taxes.

We also reported in March of this year that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="puerto-rico-entices-wealthy-americans-with-chance-to-avoid-irs-scrutiny/">Puerto Rico had enacted a special regime in order to attract wealthy persons</a></span> to invest in the island.  This regime, unlike economic citizenship programs of other countries, does not invoke §877A.

		<content><![CDATA[States have long provided <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">corporate tax breaks</a></span> and deductions to profitable companies that agree to maintain operations within their territories. While these tax breaks can total into the millions of dollars, they may not always be a reliable way to convince some companies to stay put, a new analysis suggests.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/will-corporate-tax-breaks-be-enough-to-keep-companies-in-certain-states" rel="attachment wp-att-3715"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3715" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Corporate-Tax-breaks-300x178.jpg" alt="Corporate Tax breaks" width="240" height="142" /></a>Washington state recently made history when it signed a tax law offering Boeing an unprecedented $8.7 billion in tax breaks through 2040 in an attempt to convince it to locate production of a new jetliner fleet within the state. Analysts agree that this may be the largest corporate tax offering ever. The breaks would relate to the company's business and occupation tax - the major business tax levied in Washington - as well as many property tax exemptions. However, it is unclear whether Boeing will agree to locate its operations to the state.

According to a recent analysis in The New York Times, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/will-starbucks-succeed-in-securing-new-u-s-tax-breaks/">corporate tax breaks</a></span> for occupying a certain state are not uncommon, and states, counties, and cities routinely extend roughly $80 billion a year in tax benefits to businesses each year. However, these tax benefits are not always enough to keep companies in their cross hairs, and even in cases where these benefits are accepted, reputational damage can sometimes ensue.

For instance, San Francisco - which recently provided tax benefits valued at $56 million to Twitter and other tech companies - is currently managing a string of protests from residents who feel the tax breaks are excessive and unnecessary. The protests follow a report that the city stands to lose roughly $22 million on the tax deal. However, companies and advocates of the tax breaks contend that the money and the jobs they generate - both of which contribute to the state and national economy - outweigh any subsidies they receive.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A large number of prominent Americans have formally renounced their citizenship to avoid taxes, and a new report sheds light on just how many people have taken this course of action.

<a href="/record-number-americans-renounce-citizenship-avoid-taxes/" rel="attachment wp-att-3719"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3719" style="margin-left: 15px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Avoid-Taxes-300x300.jpg" alt="Americans Renounce Citizenship to Avoid Taxes" width="210" height="210" /></a>According to a quarterly report released by the U.S. Treasury Department, approximately 560 people who either were U.S. citizens or long-term residents with green cards renounced their citizenship or turned in their green cards during the third quarter of the year. This brings the number to more than 2,300 over the course of the year. The Treasury notes that 2013 will set a record for expatriations by U.S. taxpayers, with at least a 33 percent increase from the previous high of renunciations in 2011. Many analysts agree that, while Americans are not required to provide a reason for renouncing their citizenship, many have chosen to do so to avoid U.S. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax laws</a>,</span> which are increasingly cracking down on individuals who attempt to hide income or avoid their payment responsibilities.

For instance, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/what-facebook-expatriation-and-the-ex-patriot-act-have-in-common/">Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin</a></span> made headlines in 2011 when he relocated to Singapore and turned in his U.S. passport. He cited high capital gains taxes he would have faced when Facebook went public as the reason for his decision.

Most recently, music icon Tina Turner - who has been a long-time resident of Switzerland - made the decision to voluntarily <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tina-turner-longer-looking-job-city/">relinquish her U.S. citizenship</a></span> in October. According to The Washington Post, Turner took the oath of Swiss nationality on April 10, after spending nearly two decades in the country and retiring from the stage in 2009.

However, the news source noted that unlike many Americans who have renounced citizenship, Turner did not "formally renounce her U.S. citizenship under 349(a)(5) Immigration and Nationality Act,  but took Swiss citizenship with the intent to lose her U.S. citizenship," the Post reports. Sources note that unlike renunciation - and the complex and costly processes it involves - there are  no "tax or other penalties for loss of citizenship in this fashion."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The price of bitcoins recently reached a record high of $675, up from its price of only $12 one year ago. As the price soars and more people begin to use the digital currency in all manner of transactions, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is examining whether they should intervene and start setting rules and regulations regarding Bitcoins.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/u-s-officials-scrutinize-bitcoins-as-other-governments-apply-tax-rules" rel="attachment wp-att-2596"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2596" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Are-bitcoins-taxable-300x300.jpg" alt="Are-bitcoins-taxable" width="210" height="210" /></a>The digital Bitcoin, which as of recently was not recognized as a legitimate currency by any government, first gained attention when criminals began to use it in drug deals, illegal trades, and human trafficking. Given the anonymity that Bitcoins afford users, federal officials are also concerned that, in addition to violent crimes, the currency may also be used to violate federal <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span>. The chances of this occurring may be heightened as other international governments begin to adopt the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/will-the-bitcoin-become-a-new-tax-evasion-tool/">untraceable currency as legitimate</a>.</span>

For instance, the German Finance Ministry recently classified the Bitcoin as a "unit of account", meaning that it can be used for tax and trading purposes in the country, according to the Progress report. Additionally, the Canada Revenue Agency also released new guidelines about the treatment of Bitcoins with regard to taxes, noting that since digital currency can be traded like a commodity, any resulting gains can be treated as taxable income or capital for the taxpayer.

As the Internal Revenue Service intensifies its campaign against offshore tax evasion, the recognition of bitcoins as a legitimate form of currency may complicate investigations surrounding hidden income and reporting. However, some federal officials believe that by formally acknowledging bitcoins as legitimate, the anonymity feature may be eliminated, which may help eliminate crimes committed with the currency.

"One of our biggest challenges is striking the right balance between the costs and benefits of regulation," Jennifer Calvery, the Treasury Department's head of the financial crimes unit, told CNN.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The acronym “BEPS” stands for <i>Base Erosion Profit Shifting. </i>Governments and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/" target="_blank">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a></span> ("OECD") are fighting against BEPS with the goal of reducing the ability of taxpayers to shift income, reduce effective tax rates or otherwise avail themselves of planning opportunities. Transfer pricing takes the headlines but is not the only concern.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/imported-built-in-losses-another-layer-of-complexity-added-as-a-deterrent" rel="attachment wp-att-3725"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3725" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Built-in-losses-300x250.jpg" alt="Imported Built-In Losses" width="240" height="200" /></a>An <i>imported built-in loss</i> is, as its name suggests, an unrecognized loss from property that is brought into the United States taxing jurisdiction. There are two important points to understand, the first of which relates to marginal tax rates. If the U.S. marginal corporate tax rate is 35% and is higher than that of the host jurisdiction, it stands to reason it would be better to suffer the loss in the U.S. This is a serious issue for other industrialized nations and the OECD, an advocate for these countries, is leading the fight against BEPS and to increase tax revenue. The second point is that most tax systems have mechanisms for the merger or liquidation of corporations. Some countries have a participation exemption while others have reorganization provisions, such as the U.S.

The point is that a foreign entity can be liquidated into a domestic entity on a tax-free basis. The domestic taxpayer receiving the property takes the same basis (“carryover”) of the transferor.

Up to now, the tax-free liquidation of a U.S. subsidiary was the pathway into the U.S for property having a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_blank"> built-in loss</a>. </i></span>The proposed regulations, issued in September of this year, are designed to implement the rule in §362(e)(1) enacted in 2004. The regulations impose two (2) tests which, if met, transform the basis of property. First, a foreign corporation transfers property in a complete liquidation qualifying under §332.  Second, prior to the transfer, the <i>imported property </i>would not have been subject to U.S. income tax but would be subject to U. S. income tax after the transfer. If both tests are satisfied, the property is deemed <i>loss importation property</i> having a basis equal to its Fair Market Value (FMV).

When multiple properties are transferred in liquidation, the aggregate basis of all properties transferred is compared to their aggregate FMV to determine if the <i>loss importation</i> rule applies.

There are troubling aspects of the proposed regulation. The Subpart F income of a CFC and a PFIC is not deemed to be subject U.S. income tax for purposes of applying the second prong of the test. Whether this is logical or fair is truly a matter of opinion. There are special rules for pass-through entities and for transferors exempt from U. S. income tax under a treaty. Finally, 362(e)(2), which is similar to §362(e)(1), applies to tax-free incorporations under §351.

		<content><![CDATA[Government officials have released proposed changes to the U.S. corporate tax code in an effort to encourage more multinationals to maintain or move operations to the country, which would spark job growth and keep more funds in U.S. territories.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/overhaul-of-corporate-tax-code-proposed" rel="attachment wp-att-3728"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3728" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/freshicon_333-272x300.png" alt="corporate tax code " width="245" height="270" /></a>The legislation would create a permanent exemption for many of the profits earned by American corporate subsidiaries in foreign countries, but would tax profits from goods and services sold to the American market from such subsidiaries. The proposal also calls for a temporary 20 percent tax rate on billions of dollars in corporate earnings that are currently invested abroad, a drastic reduction from the current 35 percent top corporate rate. The bill does not outline a proposed new<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/will-corporate-tax-breaks-be-enough-to-keep-companies-in-certain-states/">corporate tax rate</a>.</span>

Lastly, if certain types of income are not exempt under the proposed tax law changes, the bill would order all non-exempt earnings to be taxed immediately, but enable companies to pay their balances over a period of eight years, according to The New York Times.

If the proposal were to be enacted, analysts calculate that it would generate roughly $200 billion for the U.S. Treasury. In addition, supporters say that the measure may streamline a tax code that many corporations and lawmakers alike argue is too complex.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">High corporate tax rates</a></span> have historically been attributed to many companies' decisions to move operations abroad or avoid repatriating assets to the U.S. The new legislation is primarily designed to encourage companies to conduct the bulk of their operations within U.S. territories, rather than moving assets to countries that may offer more favorable rates. The Wall Street Journal reported that because the bill is still in its infancy, many multinationals are split on whether the proposals would be lucrative enough to make them reconsider repatriating sizable assets.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has long examined corporate compliance with federal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/partners/joseph-m-donegan/" target="_blank">tax law</a></span>, but the agency recently announced that it will focus more <a href="/irs-increases-scrutiny-of-small-businesses/" target="_blank">scrutiny on smaller companies</a> that are classified as partnerships.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/irs-to-focus-attention-on-small-business-partnerships" rel="attachment wp-att-3731"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3731" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tax-gap-300x251.jpg" alt="Small Business Partnerships" width="240" height="201" /></a>The federal agency explained that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/partnerships/" target="_blank">small business partnerships</a></span> have become more prevalent in recent years, and therefore more complex, creating a greater need for additional oversight and guidance from tax authorities, Bloomberg reported. Faris Fink, who heads the agency's Small Business/Self-Employed Division, recently spoke at the American Institute of CPAs' National Tax Conference, and indicated that closer examination of partnerships' tax returns would be a "top priority" over the next year and into the future, the news source added.

"The Service has for a long time focused its energy on corporations," he said. "Frankly, we're a little bit behind the curve in getting around to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/creating-a-succession-partnership-can-mitigate-disputes/" target="_blank">developing a partnership strategy</a></span>."

Fink noted that many employees in his division lack the sufficient training and skills to keep up with the evolving and rapidly growing number of partnerships and pass-throughs -  including S Corporations and sole proprietorships - that may threaten tax law compliance and lead to ambiguity about federal guidelines. Therefore, the agency will be increasing its training resources for agents.

In a separate report, the agency also plans to begin setting strict deadlines for delivery of information from companies and wealthy individuals facing audits to make the process more efficient, Reuters reported. Currently, no hard deadlines exist for this data, meaning that audits can be dragged out for a lengthy period of time and often cut into agency resources the longer these processes are delayed.

Facing budget cuts and limited resources, the IRS has been implementing new strategies to bolster auditing programs and reduce the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/report-irs-needs-to-reevaluate-tax-gap-estimate/">federal tax gap </a></span>while working under these financial restraints. The agency has previously said that funding shortfalls may reduce the number of audits on individual taxpayers in the coming years, but they plan to focus more attention on companies and wealthy individuals, as the potential for recovering significant hidden funds may be greater.]]></content>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/cayman-islands-costa-rica-agree-to-divulge-americans-account-details-to-u-s-officials" rel="attachment wp-att-2914"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2914" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Offshore_tax-havens-300x198.jpg" alt="Offshore_tax-havens" width="240" height="158" /></a>The Cayman Islands and Costa Rica have entered into <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-france-sign-intergovernmental-agreement-to-combat-offshore-tax-evasion/">Intergovernmental Agreements</a></span> (IGAs) with the U.S., according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Setting up an agreement with the Caymans is considered a big win for U.S. tax officials, particularly because the small island has no income tax and is frequently labeled as a <a href="/offshore-tax-haven-report/">t<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ax haven</span></a> that attracts a wide variety of investment funds eager to take advantage of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_self">tax law</a></span>. Costa Rica, as well, has been renowned for offering a flexible tax structures to investors, which has allowed it to garner a great deal of foreign investment in recent years.

Some countries already report account details to the IRS voluntarily, but others - such as the Caymans and Costa Rica - rely upon IGAs to help set parameters for reporting this information and establishing relationships with other countries. Under IGAs, a bank or other foreign financial institution reports to its own government on Americans. The foreign government then reports to the IRS. Essentially, IGAs ensure that banks and institutions are not directly reporting to the IRS.

Under Costa Rica's IGA with the U.S., reporting will be reciprocal, meaning that the Costa Rican government can also obtain tax information about its citizens with assets in the U.S., according to the Guardian. However, this reciprocal information trading agreement - while popular with several other countries who have signed FATCA deals - is not currently in place with the Cayman Islands.

Currently, the U.S. has signed 12 FATCA agreements with other countries, and 16 other lesser agreements. Federal officials also report that they are currently in dialogue with a number of other territories.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that requires Texas billionaire Billy Joe "Red" McCombs to pay millions in a tax shelter penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.

<a href="/u-s-supreme-court-sides-irs-mccombs-tax-shelter-penalty-case" rel="attachment wp-att-3743"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3743" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Irsscale1.jpg" alt="Tax Shelter Penalty" width="220" height="220" /></a>The court ruled that McCombs, co-founder of Clear Channel Communications Inc. and former owner of the Minnesota Vikings, tried to shield $45 million in taxable income from the IRS using a sham partnership, and is therefore subject to the federal agency's 40 percent<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/irs-held-to-three-year-timeline-to-audit-tax-shelters/">tax-shelter penalty</a></span> that applies when individuals understate their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">capital-gains tax liability</a></span> by inflating their basis, Bloomberg reported. The ruling reverses a 5th Circuit court opinion, which held that the 40 percent penalty did not apply in sham partnership cases under current tax law.

In 1999, McCombs and his business partner Gary Woods set up a partnership known as "current options bring reward alternatives," or<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-jersey-employment-attorneys-issue-cobra-audit-alert/">COBRA</a>,</span> which was designed to generate financial losses to offset windfall gains, Reuters reported. More specifically, McCombs and Woods relied upon paper losses to offset real gains, thereby reducing their tax liability.

The IRS noted that the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/"> tax avoidance strategy</a></span> allowed McCombs to claim $45 million in losses from transactions that actually cost them only $1.37 million. Lower courts ruled that these partnerships - which had been utilized by a number of high net-worth individuals and business owners - are sham transactions and therefore subject to taxation.

McCombs attempted to argue that the penalty does not apply when the IRS considers the entire transaction to be a sham, but legislation passed in 2010 allowed the IRS to apply the steep penalty in all future cases, according to Bloomberg. Justice Antonin Scalia agreed and called McComb's arguments "unpersuasive."

"At the end of the day, Woods' and McCombs' $3.2 million investment generated tax losses that, if treated as valid, could have shielded more than $45 million of income from taxation," Scalia wrote, according to Reuters. "The penalty is applicable to tax underpayments resulting from the partners' participation in the COBRA tax shelter."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. government has made a number of notable strides to enforce tax evasion law cracking down on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-france-sign-intergovernmental-agreement-to-combat-offshore-tax-evasion/">foreign offshore tax evaders</a></span><a href="/cayman-islands-costa-rica-agree-to-divulge-americans-account-details-to-u-s-officials/">,</a> but a new report suggests that the Internal Revenue Service may still lack the sufficient preparedness to fully implement the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/?s=FATCA">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.</a></span>

<img class="alignright  wp-image-3761" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Off-Shore-Tax-Evasion-300x220.jpg" alt="Off Shore Tax Evasion, IRS " width="270" height="198" />According to a report published by government watchdog Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS faces a number of obstacles that may upset the July 2014 implementation of FATCA, including software design issues, low staffing levels, and budgetary constraints. Additionally, the agency said that the IRS has been unable to "fully utilize the initial system" to manage the program, which came at a price tag of $8.6 million.

"The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act can effectively improve U.S. tax administration involving offshore accounts by utilizing FATCA computer applications that are developed and implemented in a timely and effective manner," said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. "Improved system development, management controls, and testing are needed to ensure the system works as intended to improve tax compliance."

While the agency has noted that several alterations still need to be made, it has defended its progress and responded to technology concerns by arguing that "the need to redesign the system in 2012 was due to significant and necessary regulatory changes."

With less than a year until the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/" target="_blank">offshore tax evasion</a> </span>program is set to go fully into effect, the IRS is still working to create a close network for foreign participants who will agree to account sharing agreements. Between 200,000 and 400,000 foreign banks, investment funds, and insurers are expected to register with the IRS to comply with the new tax law and many of the agreements signed with certain countries are reciprocal agreements.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[MC Hammer, known for his iconic harem pants and 1990s hit "U Can't Touch This," has been slapped with a hefty tax sentence from the Internal Revenue Service, who argue that the rapper has failed to settle tax liabilities incurred in the mid- to late 1990s.

<a href="irs-hits-mc-hammer-hefty-tax-lien" rel="attachment wp-att-3777"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3777" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mchammer.gif" alt="Tax Lien" width="242" height="242" /></a>The rapper, whose real name is Stanley Kirk Burrell, is accused o<span style="text-decoration: underline;">f <a href="/unpaid-federal-taxes-lead-to-federal-tax-liens/">owing the federal tax agency</a></span> roughly $800,000 in back taxes dating back to 1996 and 1997. In response to Burrell's failure to settle his balance under tax law, the agency slapped the rapper and his wife with a $798,033.48 lien, Forbes reports. Burrell's financial struggles persisted prior to 1996 when he first got into tax trouble. The <a href="/?s=celebrity">musician</a>, whose previous net worth was estimated to be in the $33 million mark, sought bankruptcy in 1996, citing $13 million in debt.

However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal tax debt</a></span> is not typically discharged under bankruptcy, and Burrell was still required to settle his tax bill.

Despite the lien, the rapper is asserting that he has already settled his tax balance, and took to the social media site Twitter to say that his balance was paid and he has a receipt to prove it. However, he also indicated that if the agency proves he failed to pay his bill, he would cooperate.

"I put over $5 million in my account [and] asked the IRS how much do you want? They put it in writing, I paid them and got a receipt," the rapper wrote, according to Forbes. "Render unto Cesar what is Cesar's...owe no man but to love him. Suing me from 18 years ago? If they win, I'll pay them. Life is good."

The IRS is typically restrained to a three-year statute to bring proceedings against those who violate tax law, but these thresholds can be extended in many cases, and <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/tax-lien-buyers-and-contaminated-property/">tax liens</a> are not uncommon in instances when the IRS is facing challenges collecting liabilities.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Internal Revenue Service officials have long argued about the stress of budget cuts on their daily operations, and a new report by its advisory council backs up these claims and asserts that financial constraints may actually harm<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-to-focus-attention-on-small-business-partnerships/"> taxpayers and business owners</a>.</span>

<a href="irs-budget-constraints-may-harm-taxpayers-advisory-council-warns" rel="attachment wp-att-3780"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3780" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IRS-on-back-293x300.jpg" alt="Tax payer" width="293" height="300" /></a>According to the agency's annual report, budget cuts may actually increase compliance costs for Americans, entrepreneurs, corporations and investors, largely because fewer financial resources are available for the IRS to produce clear and concise regulations and provide assistance and guidance to those who are confused by tax law provisions.

"The IRS accomplishes its mission by issuing clear, concise <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax law guidance</a>, providing assistance to taxpayers, enforcing current tax law, and collecting taxes used by the U.S. government. Reducing the IRS's budget constrains IRS effectiveness and efficiency, which results in taxpayers' loss of respect for the agency and our voluntary tax system," the report said. "This undermines the voluntary tax system, reduces government revenues and promotes the underground economy."

The IRS is currently facing a number of increased costs on several fronts. The number of fraud and identity theft cases has been on the rise, and the agency's string of corporate lawsuits and attempts to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-budget-for-2014-focuses-on-increasing-manpower-to-ensure-tax-compliance/">curb tax law violators</a></span> has also taken on a large share of the agency's resources. As the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=Patient+Protection+and+Affordable+Care+Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act </a></span>goes fully into effect on Jan. 1, 2014, the costs associated with managing the tax aspect of the health reform law are also expected to increase.

In an effort to eliminate some of their costs, the IRS announced that it may temper investigations and tax audits into the middle class, but will likely step up its attention to entities that have more opportunities to shield income and assets - namely small businesses and mid-sized corporations. The IRS also plans to continue its campaign to combat offshore tax evasion, in the hopes that hidden funds recovered through these investigations will help close the $385 billion tax gap and free up more resources.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many affluent Americans, investors and business owners were pleased when the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">federal estate tax law</a></span> was changed, allowing for a $5.25 million <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/affluent-urged-to-focus-on-state-estate-taxes/">estate tax exemption</a></span> for individuals and $10.5 million for joint filers. However, many people who are focusing on retirement and going through the process are still contending with state estate taxes, with some even relocating to new areas that provide a more favorable tax structure. In an effort to keep wealthy residents from fleeing, some states are considering sweeping changes to their existing estate tax rules.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DSC8228_08-15-2011_7801And2more_tonemapped2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3787" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DSC8228_08-15-2011_7801And2more_tonemapped2-300x200.jpg" alt="New York Estate Taxes" width="300" height="200" /></a>The New York State Tax Relief Commission, for instance, proposed significant modifications to its current laws that would implement a lower top rate and a higher exemption to match the new permanent federal estate tax exemption and be indexed for inflation, Forbes reported. Under the proposed changes, individuals with a net worth of $5.34 million or less would owe no New York state estate tax - a considerable increase from its existing $1 million exemption. Additionally, the commission proposed reducing the top tax rate on amounts above that to 10 percent, down from its current 16 percent.

New York state is currently one of 17 states with either an estate tax or an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/splitting-inheritances-evenly/">inheritance tax</a> </span>in place, and only two states have a lower exemption, according to the New York Observer Today. Additionally, the commission notes that estate tax exemptions have been unable to keep pace with rising home values in many areas, resulting in more individuals becoming subject to estate taxes.

Over the last several years, the state has faced an exodus of wealthy residents and investors who wished to avoid the state's high tax rates and limited estate <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/gifts-should-be-a-crucial-part-of-your-business-succession-plan/">tax exemptions</a>.</span> However, the commission hopes that putting more favorable rates in place will help reverse the tide of individuals relocating their families and their investments to other states as they amass more wealth.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The end of the year can be a stressful time for business owners, who are trying to balance spending the holidays with friends and loved ones, along with their personal and business year-end financial and tax management. While conducting the latter, however, it's important for entrepreneurs and owners to take the time to update their business succession plan - or begin one, if they have yet to do so.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/factors-to-consider-during-year-end-business-succession-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-3796"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3796" style="margin-left: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/succession-plan-300x260.jpg" alt="business-succession-plan" width="240" height="208" /></a>The last scenario any owner wants to face is seeing their company fall into the wrong hands, so it's critical to end the year with a firm<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/core-elements-of-an-effective-succession-plan/">succession plan</a></span> in tow. When reviewing or drawing up paperwork, there are several <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/key-questions-to-ask-during-business-succession-planning/">factors to keep in mind </a></span>that can make the planning process easier. For instance, owners might start with determining how to divvy up assets and ownership shares.

This is of particular importance for family businesses in which owners have multiple children. More often than not, owners may not choose to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/splitting-inheritances-evenly/">divide up ownership equally</a></span>, but instead take a non-emotional approach and assign responsibilities to those best equipped to run the company. Clarifying responsibilities, ownership and asset allocation early on - and having a discussion with family members about this decision - can make drawing up the paperwork simpler and mitigate future family disputes.

Owners might also choose to have the company valued if they plan to hand over the reins in the future, as the value of the business may directly affect their financial and tax obligations. Ensuring all successors are groomed on the company's financial situation and how it will impact their federal and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">state tax law</a></span> responsibilities is also critical to avoid missteps that could put the business in jeopardy. Owners whose business value will trigger large tax liabilities might consider speaking with a legal professional about setting up a trust or other mechanism to help keep wealth intact when transferring a company to successors.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[With only a few weeks left until the beginning of 2014, many business owners are scrambling to get their finances and tax documents in order. There are a number of tax benefits - some of which are expiring - that business owners and entrepreneurs should take into account<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"> during their year-end tax planning</a>.</span>

<a href="3-year-end-tax-tips-business-owners-consider" rel="attachment wp-att-3806"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3806" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tax-tips-for-business-owners-300x253.jpg" alt="tax-tips-for-business-owners" width="270" height="228" /></a>Listed below are three common deductions, credits and tax scenarios owners may choose to concentrate on in order to plan accordingly and potentially <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">lower their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tax liability</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span>

<strong>1. DOMA Ruling</strong>
The strike down of the same-sex provision of the <a href="/?s=DOMA"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defense Against Marriage Act</span> </a>may have significant implications for employers, especially as they relate to payroll taxes, health insurance, and employment. The change in the law will not only affect the taxable income of employees, but also impact an employer's tax liability because it is determined by the taxable income of employees. Employers may also need to update and amend their qualified plans and plan practices to treat<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/employers-employees-still-confused-over-doma-rules/"> same-sex and opposite-sex spouses</a></span> the same under qualified retirement plans.

<strong>2. Expiring tax breaks</strong>
Although Congress may choose to reinstate expiring tax breaks before the year ends, it's always best to proceed as if tax breaks are going away. Companies who are eligible for the following expiring tax benefits should work with a tax or legal professional to gather the proper documentation they will need to claim the breaks:
<ul>
<li>IRS Code Section 179 Deduction of $500,000 is set to be reduced to $25,000 in 2014</li>
<li>Work Opportunity Tax Credits and Research and Development Tax Credits are set to expire</li>
<li>Bonus Depreciation of 50 percent expires on Dec. 31, 2013</li>
<li>Accelerated Deduction for Qualified Real Property placed in service by Dec. 31, 2013 of $250,000 expires</li>
</ul>
<strong>3. Record gathering</strong>
Most companies maintain organized records for traditional "big-name" deductions, but smaller deductions may require more digging and organization. For instance, many companies deduct entertainment and business meals associated with client meetings. However, the IRS closely scrutinizes these deductions and requires sufficient documentation. Companies planning to write-off these expenses should be prepared to provide records stating when, where, and why they had the meal, the topics discussed and, of course, receipts for expenses more than $75.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[With only a few days left until the new year rolls in, many Americans are conducting their<a href="/factors-to-consider-during-year-end-business-succession-planning/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> year-end tax planning</span> </a>and establishing their tax plans for 2014. The Internal Revenue Service recently released the income tax brackets for the 2014 tax year, which will be essential in helping individuals make informed decisions about their various strategies next year, including estate and gift taxes.

<a href="americans-know-2014-tax-brackets" rel="attachment wp-att-3814"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3814" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tax-Brackets-300x150.png" alt="Tax Brackets" width="300" height="150" /></a>For many filers, the 2014 rates will be a step up from this year's parameters due to inflation. For instance, the standard deduction will increase by $100 to $6,200 for singles, and $12,400 for married joint filers. Head of Household filers can take a standard deduction of $9,100. The personal exemption amount will rise to $3,950 in 2014, up from $3,900 in 2013. The 2013 exemption of $80,800 for married joint filers will also increase by $1,300 in 2014. For single filers it will rise by $900 from the $51,900 level in 2013.

In addition to changes to the standard deduction and personal exemption amounts, the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption was made permanent and indexed for inflation for 2014. Although the tax exclusion on annual gifts will remain unchanged at $14,000, the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption will increase from $5.25 million in 2013 to $5.34 million next year. This increase may greatly help high net-worth earning individuals and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/">business owners</a></span> pass on a greater share of their wealth to future generations and make more calculated decisions as they relate to trusts and other vehicles aimed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">keep family wealth intact</a>.</span>

It's also important to note the "portability" of a deceased spouse's unused exclusion amount, which was made a permanent part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in 2012. The rule allows a surviving spouse to use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-planning-for-the-undead/">deceased spouse's unused estate tax exclusion</a></span> - up to $5.34 million next year.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Business owners, investors, and individuals will have more time to prepare their taxes and get their financial houses in order, following an announcement by the Internal Revenue Service that it will postpone the beginning of tax season to Jan. 31, 2014.

<a href="irs-postpones-beginning-tax-season-second-time" rel="attachment wp-att-4755"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time-for-tax-evasion-001-300x300.jpg" alt="time-for-tax-evasion" width="300" height="300" /></a>This is the second time in recent months that the IRS has pushed back the beginning of filing season, which was initially slated to begin on Jan. 21, 2014. However, the agency said that it needs more time to implement its annual programming, updating, and testing of its more than 50 tax processing systems, which was greatly delayed as a result of the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/government-shutdown-prompts-irs-to-delay-start-of-tax-season/"> two-week government shutdown</a>.</span>

"Our teams have been working hard throughout the fall to prepare for the upcoming tax season," IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. "The late January opening gives us enough time to get things right with our programming, testing and systems validation. It's a complex process, and our bottom-line goal is to provide a smooth filing and refund process for the nation's taxpayers."

The agency added that while taxes filed electronically will be held until the Jan. 31 start date, "there is no advantage to filing on paper before the opening date."

Although all estimated tax payments will not receive a reprieve and are still required to be paid by April 15 under federal tax law, the postponement may give <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/">businesses and individuals </a></span>more time to prepare and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/factors-to-consider-during-year-end-business-succession-planning/">organize their tax documents </a></span>and review potential tax breaks for which they may be eligible. Individuals and companies are encouraged to work with a tax or legal professional to prior to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">filing their taxes</a></span> in order to determine if they qualify for expiring tax credits or deductions, make last-minute estate planning decisions and take advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion to reduce their income liabilities.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Prior to 1997, the classification for United States tax purposes of a foreign entity as a corporation, partnership or disregarded entities (sole proprietorship) was not always clear. There were, of course, <i>per se</i> corporations, that is<span style="text-decoration: underline;">, <a href="/?s=foreign+entities">foreign entities</a></span> automatically treated as corporations for United States tax purposes either by revenue ruling or regulation. Unfortunately, there were many other foreign entities which possessed both partnership and corporate characteristics. Classification of a foreign entity as a corporation for United States tax purposes required it possess more than two of the following: centralized management, continuity of life, limited liability and transferability of interest. In 1997, regulations were issued that allowed taxpayers to select the classification of the entity as a corporation, partnership or disregarded entity, except where a particular status was already mandated.

<a href="disregarded-entities-wonderful-tool-international-tax-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-3827"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3827" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/disregarded-entities-300x300.png" alt="disregarded-entities" width="240" height="240" /></a>These regulations, known as “check the box,” ushered in new planning opportunities and PLR 201332007 is an example how useful these rules can be.

U.S. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">international tax rules</a></span> contain a regime called <i>Subpart F</i> which attempts to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-evasion-tops-list-of-priorities-at-g-8-summit/"> prevent tax avoidance</a></span> by taxing certain types of income in the year earned, regardless of whether it is repatriated to the U.S.  <i>Foreign Base Company Sales</i> <i>Income</i> (<i>FBCSI</i>) is one such type of <i>Subpart F</i> <i>income</i>.  FBSCI includes income derived from the purchase of personal property from a related party and its sale to any person. <i>FBSCI </i>was designed to prevent the use of an intermediary company in a low tax jurisdiction to siphon profits out of high tax countries and park them in low tax countries. One must know that <i>FBCSI</i> does not include income derived from a sale of personal property manufactured, produced or constructed by the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/department-of-justice-calling-for-rule-change-to-pursue-foreign-businesses/"> controlled foreign corporation</a></span> (CFC) in the country of formation.

What makes PLR 201332007 interesting is that it relies on Treas. Reg. §§1.954(a)(4)(iv) which provides a CFC will have manufactured a product if it substantially contributed to the activity. Procurement and purchasing activities were deemed to qualify in this instance.  The foreign disregarded entity (FDE) was a check-the-box foreign entity and part of the CFC, the manufacturer. The payments FDE received were not<i> FBCSI</i> and did not have to be reported in the U.S.

The U.S. has consolidated returns for corporate groups, but does not permit foreign entities to consolidate. Foreign jurisdictions may have cross-border consolidation or group relief on dividends where a specified ownership level is maintained.

It is possible using “check the box” for a U.S. corporation to manufacture and source on a worldwide basis without creating FBCSI.  Prior to check-the-box, this may not have been possible.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The growing popularity and adoption of the bitcoin among Americans and businesses have put lawmakers and tax agencies in an awkward and tough position when it comes to determining whether they should <a href="/u-s-officials-scrutinize-bitcoins-as-other-governments-apply-tax-rules/">tax <span style="text-decoration: underline;">digital currency</span></a>, and how taxation would work. Following some countries' decisions to apply <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/will-the-bitcoin-become-a-new-tax-evasion-tool/">tax rules to virtual currency</a></span>, many U.S. lawmakers are now scrutinizing their own tax stance and trying to determine how best to treat the taxation of bitcoins.

<a href="questions-taxation-bitcoins-becomes-pressing" rel="attachment wp-att-3833"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3833" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Taxation-of-Bitcoins-300x200.png" alt="Taxation-of-Bitcoins" width="300" height="200" /></a>The Wall Street Journal reports that as of mid-December, the value of all bitcoins in circulation was nearly $8 billion, and the price of a bitcoin has risen from about $13.50 to about $650 on some exchanges over the course of 2013. Given the rising value of the currency, and the fact that many Americans have used to them to make real world purchases or to cover goods and services, the currency, in any other circumstance, would be considered taxable. However, reporting rules simply don't exist, Omri Marian, a professor of law at the University of Florida, told the Journal.

"People who invested in bitcoin or used it to buy goods or services this year have gains or losses, but no rules for reporting them," Marian explained. "What should they do in April?"

Additionally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">legal and tax experts</a></span> say that questions about how to classify the bitcoin will also affect the way in which lawmakers choose to tax them. For instance, government officials will need to determine the circumstances under which the bitcoin be considered a commodity, a currency, or a capital asset for tax purposes, as well as whether bitcoin transactions are similar to barter. With the Internal Revenue Service focusing more attention and resources on the crackdown of tax evaders and illegal offshore account transactions, agency officials will also be charged with establishing rules for the anonymous currency as it relates to offshore accounts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Treasury made positive steps forward in December in its campaign against tax evasion, with the agency signingbilateral agreements with jurisdictions to comply with the tax law provisions outlined by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=FACTA">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.</a></span>

<a href="u-s-signs-six-new-bilateral-agreements-crack-tax-evasion" rel="attachment wp-att-3839"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3839" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/crack-tax-evasion-300x200.png" alt="crack down tax evasion" width="300" height="200" /></a>In a one-week time span in mid-December, Malta, the Netherlands, The Islands of Bermuda, and three UK Crown Dependencies – Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man – signed various agreements with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/treasury-releases-additional-guidance-on-employer-mandate/">Treasury Department</a></span> to implement FATCA. Treasury officials said the agreements represented another step forward in ensuring compliance with tax laws, strengthening global relationships and collaborating to reach a common end goal.

Malta, the Netherlands, and each of the Crown Dependencies entered into Model 1A agreements. The structure of these agreements requires that foreign financial institutions in these jurisdictions report the information required under FATCA about U.S. accounts to their home governments, which in turn will report the information to the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, these agreements are reciprocal, meaning that U.S. officials will also be required to provide similar<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax information</a> </span>to these governments regarding individuals and entities from their jurisdictions with accounts in the U.S.

"FATCA continues to gather momentum as we work with partners worldwide to combat <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tigta-irs-ill-prepared-offshore-tax-evasion-law/">offshore tax evasion</a></span>," said Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack. "This large number of signings in one week alone sends a strong signal to tax evaders everywhere: international support for FATCA is growing."

To date, the U.S. has signed 18 FATCA intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) and 11 agreements in substance. The government is still engaging in discussions with a number of other countries and jurisdictions ahead of the 2014 implementation date. Those countries that choose not to sign agreements and adhere with FATCA mandates may face a 30 percent withholding penalty, and essentially be frozen out of U.S. markets.]]></content>

The following are some<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/2013-year-in-review-top-tips-for-your-new-york-or-new-jersey-business/">tax tips companies </a></span>can use to get ready for this <a href="/irs-postpones-beginning-tax-season-second-time/">tax season</a>:

<a href="tax-tips-get-businesses-ready-2014" rel="attachment wp-att-3806"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3806" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tax-tips-for-business-owners-300x253.jpg" alt="tax-tips-for-business-owners" width="210" height="177" /></a><strong>- Review subcontractor data:</strong> Tax law requires businesses to submit a Form-1099 to any subcontractor that was paid more than $600 for his or her services, according to Entrepeneur.com. These forms need to be mailed to the recipient by Jan. 31, so businesses need to get started on these as soon as possible. The information necessary to send a 1099 includes the subcontractor's address, Social Security number or federal ID number. This can be obtained by providing them with a Form W9 upon hiring.

<strong>- Shift income into 2014:</strong> Businesses that want to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/3-year-end-tax-tips-business-owners-consider/">reduce taxable income</a></span> for 2013 may want to consider shifting income into 2014. This would require companies to bill customers late, so the income doesn't come in during the period that would make it eligible for the 2013<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax filing</a>,</span> according to Forbes. This translates potential revenue into 2014, which allows businesses to reduce taxable income for this filing.

<strong>- Schedule a professional tax planning session: </strong>The last thing a business wants to do is make a mistake when filing its taxes. For this reason, top decision makers should consider seeking professional help. Tax pros could potentially help a business reduce its taxable income, and, in turn, its tax bill in 2014. According to Entrepreneur.com, this move is recommended to any company that saw its profits increase significantly this past year. However, it could be helpful for all businesses to avoid costly mistakes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service has so many tax laws that people may struggle to remain informed. One rule that could prove beneficial to people is the <a href="/gift-tax-myths-and-misunderstandings-2/">gift tax</a>. Taxpayers are able to give $13,000 per year to as many donees as they desire, as long as the gift is deemed present interest by the IRS, which means the recipient can enjoy the immediate benefit in a significant way.

<a href="advantages-gift-tax-law" rel="attachment wp-att-3860"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3860" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gift-tax-230x300.png" alt="gift tax" width="230" height="300" /></a>This is the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law/"> perfect tax law</a></span> for grandparents that want to invest in their grandchildren's future. For example, grandma and grandpa can give each of their grandkids $14,000 tax free to help establish a college fund.

However, there are exceptions that allow people to gift more than $14,000. If the money is provided for the director payment of medical expenses or tuition on behalf of another person the gifts are non taxable as long as they are made directly to the medical provider or school.

The following are some other gifts that are non-taxable:
<ul>
<li>Gifts between spouses if both are U.S. citizens</li>
<li>Gist to a political organization for its use</li>
<li>Gifts to certain charities</li>
</ul>
It is important that people understand exactly what the gift tax is because the current federal gift/estate tax is 40 percent. In addition to knowing the exemptions, Americans also need to be aware of which gifts will be taxed.

Parents that want to provide a son or daughter with money to help them to buy their first house need to understand that the gifted funds will be taxed. It is necessary to file a Form 709 gift tax return, which is recommended to be filled out with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">experienced tax attorney</a></span> so no mistakes are made.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[While nobody wants to think about life after they are gone, being prepared is important, which is why people should take estate planning seriously. By completing the necessary steps, people can ensure that their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/">children and spouses</a></span> are taken care of should the unfortunate happen.

<a href="4-steps-successful-estate-planning" rel="attachment wp-att-3883"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3883" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Planning-Estate.jpg" alt="Estate Planning" width="270" height="149" /></a>The following are four steps that can be taken to ensure<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/pay-estate-tax-over-time/">estate planning</a> </span>is a success.

<strong>1. Choose professionals to help: </strong>This isn't a process that people will want to undertake on their own, so it will be important to select experienced professionals to help. This includes getting a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">tax attorney</a></span>, accountant, financial planner, and trustee, among others. These professionals can help ensure that there are no errors made during the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"> estate-planning process</a></span>.

<strong>2. Discover assets and liabilities:</strong> In order to plan an estate, people will need to know how much money they have in assets and liabilities. This could be bank accounts, homes, stocks, debts and many other things. By discovering exactly how much is in each account, people can allocate their assets accurately.

<strong>3. Hash out the specifics: </strong>Estate planning can be a difficult process. People will need to figure out many specifics before completing their plans, such as who will act as the executor and should they appoint a single trustee or co-trustees? The professionals hired to assist in this process should be able to provide valuable input at this time, as they have likely helped during many estate plans in the past.

<strong>4. Construct the plan and complete documents:</strong> The final step will be to actually construct the plan and complete the documents to make it official. The legal formalities will make sure that assets go to the people who were awarded them in the plan. It is probably a good idea to make recipients aware of this fact before anything happens.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax laws require federal and state estate taxes, and many advisers have put their major focus focus on the federal level in the past. However, with the exemption rising to $5.25 million - unused amounts can be transferred to a surviving spouse -<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303680404579143333079187024" target="_blank">many people actually don't end up paying federal estate tax</a>,</span> according to The Wall Street Journal. For this reason, it might be time to put more of a focus on the state level.

<a href="state-estate-taxes-important-federal" rel="attachment wp-att-3886"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3886" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/estate-taxes.jpg" alt="estate-taxes" width="300" height="210" /></a>Estate and inheritance taxes are levied by 19 states and Washington, D.C., and can be as high as 19 percent. Each state generally offers its own exemptions. For example, New Jersey's is $675,000.

One of the biggest decisions for a person in regards to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">estate tax</a></span> is where they should retire. With different laws in different states, it might be a good idea for individuals to move somewhere that has more relaxed laws, so the money and other assets left for their families isn't highly taxed.

New York is one state that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2013/12/13/big-changes-to-new-yorks-estate-tax-on-agenda-for-2014/" target="_blank">currently undergoing major changes to its estate tax</a></span>. According to Forbes, the Empire State could ease its tax laws as early as next year, which may help keep retirees from fleeing the area during retirement.

The state estate tax would not be eliminated, however - it would come into play at a higher level of wealth and at a lower rate, which could save people money when <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/">passing on assets to children and spouses</a></span>. The current exemption sits at $1 million, but that will rise to $5.34 million when the changes take place. Any amounts above that would be taxed 10 percent, which would be a decrease from the 16 percent that is levied now.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The beginning of the year generally means business owners, investors and individuals begin to prepare their taxes. However, thanks to the government shutdown in October, tax season in 2014 has been delayed, according to CNN Money. Instead of accepting 2013 tax returns on Jan. 21, the Internal Revenue Service won't begin to take them until Jan. 31.

<a href="benefit-filing-tax-returns-early" rel="attachment wp-att-3889"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3889" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tax-Returns-300x300.jpg" alt="Tax-Returns" width="240" height="240" /></a>"The late January opening gives us enough time to get things right with our programming, testing and systems validation," IRS Action Commissioner Danny Werfel, told the news source. "It's a complex process, and our bottom-line goal is to provide a smooth filing and refund process for the nation's taxpayers."

Despite the fact that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-postpones-beginning-tax-season-second-time/"> tax season is delayed</a></span>, many services are already accepting returns. But, Forbes said there is no benefit to filing early, as the IRS will not begin to accept returns until the end of the month whether taxes are filed on the 10th or 25th of January. In fact, the IRS website specifically states that there is no advantage to filing online or on paper prior to the opening date.

Filing early could present some issues as well, as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">complete tax information</a></span> may not be available. This could lead<a href="/tax-tips-get-businesses-ready-2014/"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business owners</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> investors and individuals to miss out on credits - or worse - make an error that forces them to file an amended return.

While the start date has been pushed back, business owners, investors and individuals still need to be sure to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"> file taxes on time</a></span>. Failure to do so could result in fines and penalties. The due date for returns continues to be April 15, according to CNN Money, which is set by statute. But, it is possible to file for a six-month extension.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax season is just around the corner, which means business owners need to begin getting prepared. While doing so, it is important that the following common missteps are avoided:

<strong><a href="4-tax-mistakes-often-made-business-owners" rel="attachment wp-att-3898"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3898" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tax-mistakes-business-owners.jpg" alt="tax-mistakes-business-owners" width="228" height="240" /></a></strong><strong>1. Filing late: </strong>Probably the easiest mistake to avoid is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/benefit-filing-tax-returns-early/">filing taxes late</a></span>. According to Nolo, this could result in the Internal Revenue Service charging business owners an additional 5 percent each month on the balance due. However, the late fees do have a maximum of 25 percent for the first five months.

<strong>2. Accounting errors:</strong> When <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-tips-get-businesses-ready-2014/">preparing taxes for the year</a></span>, the most important aspect if the amount of revenues and expenses the business had. To ensure this is accurate, Business News Daily said a profit-loss statement should be compiled. Knowing where money is going and how it is being spent could<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"> help business owners save money</a>.

<strong>3. Inaccuracies:</strong> One of the most important things business owners need to remember when filing taxes is to ensure that everything is accurate. According to Nolo, tax law could hit a company with a 20 percent penalty if it is found the business was negligent in reporting income or the amount owed in taxes. For this reason, it is recommended to employ a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"> professional who can look over the tax filing</a></span>, and make sure there is nothing that could lead to fines or penalties.

<strong>4. Commingling: </strong>Throughout the year, business owners will take in income. Business News Daily said it is important to keep this money, and any funds for expenses, separate from personal income and costs. Business bank statements should only be used for business expenses. If business and personal funds are commingled, it could increase tax debts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The payment of interest, other than in currency, between related corporations carries consequences for the calculation of the foreign tax credit (FTC).  Chief Counsel Advice 201336018 (CCA) addresses such a situation in a U.S. consolidated group setting. The facts in the CCA are a U.S. parent corporation (P) owned all of the shares of two U.S. corporations (US-1 and US-2). P loaned US-1 funds that US-1 re-loaned to US-2.  US-2 then transferred these funds down its chain of foreign subsidiary companies to finance the acquisition of foreign assets.

<a href="cca-201336018-collateral-consequences-foreign-tax-purposes" rel="attachment wp-att-3914"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3914" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Foreign-Tax-Purposes-300x300.jpg" alt="Foreign-Tax-Purposes" width="240" height="240" /></a>The terms of the loan agreement gave US-2 the option to pay interest either in currency baws on a LIBOR formula or in units of a foreign limited partnership (“FLP”) that is treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes.  Internal Revenue Code §163(l) disallows a deduction for interest paid or accrued using equity and classifies the equity as “disqualified debt.”  Payment of interest other than in currency impacts the U.S. consolidated return and the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/disregarded-entities-wonderful-tool-international-tax-planning/"> calculation of the foreign tax credit</a>. </span> Unfortunately, the impact can be different.

The consolidated return rules treat the non-deductible interest paid to the recipient as tax-exempt interest and the basis in the stock of the subsidiary is increased by the payment.  No doubt the author of the CCA considered the possibility of inflating basis using FLP units to make payments. If that were to occur, the basis in the stock of the subsidiary would be overstated without a basis adjustment to accommodate the goal of §163(l). Unfortunately, these rules treat tax-exempt interest and interest on disqualified debt for purposes differently for purposes of the basis adjustment.

The next complication comes from the impact of basis adjustments upon the calculation of the foreign tax credit (FTC).  Simply stated, the FTC is limited to the U.S. tax that would be imposed upon foreign source income. In order to calculate foreign source income, we must deduct (a) those expenses and losses which can be definitely allocated.  and (b) then deduct a ratable allocation of other expenses which cannot be definitely allocated. Interest cannot be definitely allocated because it is considered fungible. Rather, interest is allocated between domestic and foreign source income on the basis of either income or assets, using either fair market value or tax book basis.

The taxpayer in the CCA took the position that the interest disallowed also requires the basis in the shares of the foreign company to be reduced to maintain consistency with the consolidated return rule.

What was at stake for the taxpayer?

The reduction in the basis of foreign asset (FLP units) would reduce the basis of  foreign assets that would receive an allocation of interest. A lesser allocation of interest would increase foreign source net income and the foreign tax credit limitation.  The higher limitation would increase the foreign tax credit available to offset U.S. income tax.

The regulation under 1.861-12T(f) permits the reduction of basis for purposes of the allocation where the basis of the asset is funded by disallowed interest. The CCA concludes that the taxpayer did not satisfy the “in connection with” requirement. The CCA stated that the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/"> provision of the loan agreement</a></span> permitting payment in the form of stock was gratuitous .

Clearly, the Service’s view limits the use of the exceptions under 1.861-12T.  The CCA  reduces the taxpayer’s ability to increase its FTC which increases its tax bill.  It is unclear whether the CCA will be challenged by taxpayer in an administrative appeal of any assessment or in Tax Court.]]></content>

One of the most important things when filing is deductions, as these can<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"> save a company money</a></span>.

<a href="top-tax-deductions-business-owners" rel="attachment wp-att-3910"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3910" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Business-Owners-Tax-Deductions-300x231.jpg" alt="Business-Owners-Tax-Deductions" width="240" height="185" /></a>Tax law makes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">numerous deductions available to businesses</a></span>, and these are some of the best ones:

<strong>Home office</strong>
Business owners who run their company from home can take advantage of certain tax deductions, according to Bankrate.com. The IRS says this must be a pace devoted to the business and nothing else, however, some experts claims a home office can be part of a room. To determine how much is deductible, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=business+owners">business owners</a> </span>need to measure the work area and divide it by the square footage of the house, and multiply that by total home-related business expenses, such as mortgage, insurance and electricity.

<strong>Auto</strong>
If a person's business requires them to travel via car, some of these expenses can be deducted on a tax return, according to NOLO. There are two methods for claiming auto expenses:
<ul>
<li><em>Actual expense method:</em> Business owners keep track of and deduct the actual business-related costs</li>
<li><em>Standard mileage rate method:</em> A certain amount of money is deducted for each mile driven, plus any other tolls and parking fees</li>
</ul>
<strong>Interest</strong>
Many business owners use credit to finance purchases. In this case, the interest and carrying charges on the cards is fully tax-deductible. This deduction is limited to credit cards, as business owners can also deduct interest on a personal loan that was used to cover business expenses. However, it is important that records are kept to prove that these funds were used for company-related expenses, or else it may not be deductible.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Taxpayers adopt different structures when conducting business around. PLR 201330006 contains such an example where using various entities and the regulations avoids Subpart F inclusions.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/cfcs-disregarded-entities-partnerships-subpart-f-income/subpart-f/" rel="attachment wp-att-3922"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3922" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Subpart-F-300x193.jpg" alt="Subpart-F" width="300" height="193" /></a>A U.S. taxpayer was a “U.S. shareholder” in a foreign company, formed in country A, treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes (CFC).  U.S. shareholders are required to take into income any Subpart F income of CFC. An unrelated company (“U”) and CFC owned all of the interests in a partnership (“P”). P, in turn, owned all of the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/disregarded-entities-wonderful-tool-international-tax-planning/">disregarded entity</a></span> (“DE”) for U.S. tax purposes. DE was building a plant and would operate it selling in country A all of its production pursuant to output contracts at a market price. P and DE were also formed in country A.

Whether the income generated by DE is Subpart F income requires an analysis of Foreign Base Company income, which consists of several categories. The relevant ones for this analysis include Foreign Personal Holding Company Income (“FPHCI”), foreign base company services income (FBC Services) performed for a related person, or foreign base company sales income (FBC Sales).

The general rule applied to a partnership distributive income is that it is Subpart F income if it would be so classified if the income is received by the CFC directly.  Note the focus is on the activities or property of the CFC.

Three categories were analyzed. First, sales of DE’s output did not occur outside of country A, where CFC was incorporated. Therefore, there was no FBC Sales income.   Second, FBC Services income is derived from substantial <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">technical assistance</a></span> provided by a related person outside of the country of organization of the CFC.  Again, the technical assistance was rendered by P in country A where the CFC was formed. In each instance, the focus is on the characterization of the income as if it is received by the CFC directly.  Third, FPHCI includes virtually all types of passive income but excludes commodities that are inventory, depreciable property and consumable supplies.

An exception to FPHCI treatment exists if the income would not be FPHCI if CFC earned the income directly, taking into account the activities and property of the partnership, not the CFC.  The difference is that the activities of P, the partnership, are the focus, unlike FBC Sales and FBC Service where the test is applied as if the CFC received the income directly.

The plan used a corporation, partnership and disregarded entity to achieve the desired result of avoiding Subpart F income in the U.S. return]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Businesses have been taking advantage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/offshore-tax-haven-report/">overseas tax havens</a></span> for years, but it appears as though it could become more difficult to store funds in these places in the future. According to Private Wealth Magazine, some of the world's biggest tax havens have agreed to provide the Internal Revenue Service with information about U.S. taxpayers.

<a href="overseas-tax-havens-become-thing-past" rel="attachment wp-att-3928"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3928" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tax-havens-300x200.jpg" alt="tax havens" width="300" height="200" /></a>The Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Bermuda, Malta and the Netherlands have all agreed to help the IRS implement its new tax law the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which was created to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/cayman-islands-costa-rica-agree-to-divulge-americans-account-details-to-u-s-officials/">uncover offshore tax evasion</a>.</span>

In an interview with Private Wealth Magazine, a Financial Advisors publication, we discussed that these tax havens are beginning to cooperate, as the IRS has vowed to report taxpayers from these countries who are storing assets in the U.S.

I told the publication that "Governments are cooperating with each other because they are looking for revenue, and they're getting much better at it with the technology and the laws," and "There are not many places for the international billionaire to hide assets anymore."

Tax havens have been saving businesses billions for many years, so these agreements could be a big blow. Bloomberg News reported Jesse Drucker told NPR that Google has saved $3.1 billion in taxes in the past three years by moving its foreign profits into accounts in Ireland, the Netherlands and Bermuda.

Drucker added that businesses aren't necessarily avoiding U.S. tax bills by using these safe havens, rather just deferring as long as the funds are kept outside of the country.

"These are indefinitely reinvested earnings in your non-U.S. operations," Drucker said. "When you bring [earned income] home you're supposed to pay U.S. tax minus a credit for the income taxes you've already paid overseas. But companies have a number of techniques for bringing back profits without paying the tax."

		<content><![CDATA[After passing on, people want to be sure that their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">assets are properly disbursed to family members</a></span>. However, these assets often face estate tax law, which can cut into the value.

<a href="maryland-legislators-cut-estate-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-3933"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3933" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maryland-estate-tax.png" alt="maryland-estate-tax" width="211" height="110" /></a>This tax varies from state to state, and has an impact on where wealthy retirees choose to live after leaving the work force for good. According to the Maryland Reporter, legislators have agreed to reduce the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/state-estate-taxes-important-federal/"> state's high estate tax by returning it to federal standards</a></span>, which may help keep retirees in Maryland.

"We're going to phase out the estate tax, and raise it to the federal level," Senate President Mike Miller told the Maryland Economic Development Association. "I hope we're going to move forward on the inheritance and estate tax."

The move to reduce the estate tax would cut Maryland taxes by $14 million this fiscal year, and as much as $87 million in four years. Currently, the estate and inheritance tax accounts for less than 2 percent of all state revenues, as very few estates pay any taxes.

Maryland isn't the only state to consider cutting its estate tax, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently proposed $2 billion in tax cuts. According to The New York Times, this includes raising the estate tax exemption from $1 million to $5.25 million. The main goal behind this move is to reduce the number of New Yorkers who leave the Empire State when retiring. Cuomo's proposal included an array of other cuts, which has garnered support.

"We need to change the environment and the perception of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/new-york-plans-changes-estate-taxes/"> New York as a high-tax state</a></span>," Randy Wolken, the president of the Manufacturers Alliance of New York State, told the news source.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax law requires <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">business owners to file taxes</a></span> by a certain date, which is coming up quickly. To ensure a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/3-year-end-tax-tips-business-owners-consider/">successful tax season</a></span>, owners may want to consider the following last-minute tax tips:

<strong><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/3-last-minute-tax-tips-business-owners/tax-tips/" rel="attachment wp-att-3940"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3940" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tax-tips-300x300.png" alt="tax-tips" width="240" height="240" /></a>1. Consider green initiatives:</strong> State and federal government has made it attractive for business to deploy green initiatives. According to Forbes, business owners in Georgia can take advantage of a Clean Energy Property Tax Credit program, which will hand out $2.5 million a year through 2014. In addition to the tax advantages, green initiatives can save a company money in the long run, which could make these improvements worth making.

<strong>2. Claim all deductions:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-tips-get-businesses-ready-2014/">Business owners want to get their tax bills as small as possible</a></span>, which is why it is important to make sure all deductions are being used, according to CNBC. One deduction owners may not know about is for educational expenses - such as seminars, classes, and convention fees - that improve skills required in present employment. These small, unknown deductions can save <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/">business owners a significant amount of money</a></span> if taken full advantage of.

<strong>3. Understand out-of-state tax: </strong>Not all businesses only complete sales inside their state. For this reason, taxes may need to be paid on transactions completed out of state. It is important that business owners understand that these taxes don't need to be paid to their state of residence, as this could create a double tax bill, and cost them a lot of money. The last thing a business owner wants to have happen is paying too much tax, which is why it is important to fully understand out-of-state tax.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Individuals and families with a high net worth often have to pay a significant amount of taxes on their estate under U.S. tax law. However, there are bigger estate tax credits on the way for estates in 2014, according to the Motley Fool.

<a href="taxpayers-can-expect-bigger-estate-tax-credits-2014" rel="attachment wp-att-3949"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3949" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/estate-tax-credit-300x206.png" alt="estate-tax-credit" width="300" height="206" /></a>For example, the unified estate and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/"> gift tax exclusion</a> </span>amount is expected to increase from $5.25 million to $5.34 million. Additionally, the federal foreign earned income exclusion edged higher to $99,200, compared to $97,600 in 2013. General annual gift exclusions will have a new cap of $14,000, a significant jump from the $10,000 exclusion seen in 2000.

By taking advantage of these credits and deductions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-are-you-overassessed/">individuals and families can reduce their tax bill</a></span>. There are also other ways to lower estate taxes, including:

<strong>Create an Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust:</strong> According to Forbes, an IDGT is a trust that allows transferred assets to be moved from an estate for estate and gift tax purposes, but not for income tax purposes.

<strong>Married couples should take advantage of both exemptions: </strong>Each U.S. citizen is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law/">entitled to an estate tax exemption</a>.</span> Married couples are able to take advantage of both exemptions, which can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/4-steps-successful-estate-planning/">reduce their estate tax bills</a></span>, according to EstatePlanning.com. This may seem like a simple step to take, but many taxpayers may not be aware they are afforded both exemptions.

<strong>Give tax-free gifts:</strong> Each year, U.S. tax law allows people to give tax-free gifts. These can be up to $13,000 - $26,000 if married - to as many recipients as a taxpayer wishes. By completing this step, people are able to reduce their estate tax bill.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax law allows the Internal Revenue Service to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/irs-to-focus-attention-on-small-business-partnerships/">audit a business</a></span> if it feels that there is a mistake with a tax return. However, according to Inman, audits are on the decline. IRS statistics showed that the rate for small corporation to be audited was 0.95 percent, whereas this number jumped to 15.84 percent with corporations that have more than $10 million in assets.

<a href="businesses-can-avoid-audited" rel="attachment wp-att-3958"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3958" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Audited-300x300.png" alt="Audited" width="240" height="240" /></a>No matter the size of a business, it would be wise for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-are-you-overassessed/">owners to take the necessary steps </a></span>to avoid an audit. The following are a few simple steps that can be taken to prevent this from happening:

<strong>- Know what is being filed:</strong> The last thing a business owner should be doing when filing his or her taxes is to not understand tax laws, according to Intuit. It is important to know all the deductions that can be used, and exactly how to file taxes, as even the slightest error could lead to an audit.

<strong>- Double check everything: </strong>No matter how many times someone has <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/3-last-minute-tax-tips-business-owners/">filed taxes for their business</a></span>, there is always the risk that they make a mistake. For this reason, even the most experienced business owners should double check their taxes. It is probably a good idea to triple check as well, as the extra work put in before filing can help avoid a stressful audit in the future.

<strong>- Keep tax documents for seven years: </strong>In certain situations, there is nothing a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">business can do to prevent an audit</a></span>. That said, it is important to have the necessary information on file to prevent it from being a bad situation for the company. Intuit recommended having tax documentation for seven years, as the IRS generally reviews previous returns during an audit.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[It is difficult to ascertain when a claim against a trustee arises because the act giving rise to the claim may not be disclosed to the beneficiary. Therein lies the tension between the common law traditions of statute of repose (limitations) and the Doctrine of Laches (“Laches”).

<a href="claim-trustee-arise-uniform-trust-code" rel="attachment wp-att-3962"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3962" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Claim-Against-a-Trustee-300x300.png" alt="Claim-Against-a-Trustee" width="240" height="240" /></a>Laches attempts to impose a standard that recognizes a reasonable balance of the interests of the two sides. The beneficiary may not be aware of he trustee’s breach of duty for many years after the event so it is unfair to impose a deadline measured from the date of the breach. It is also unfair that a trustee face potential liability forever. Laches attempts to balance the competing interests by requiring the beneficiary to bring an action within a reasonable time of learning of the event of breach giving rise to the claim.

When does a beneficiary <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">learn of the breach and gain sufficient knowledge of the law</a></span> to know he or she has a claim against the trustee?  This intensely factual inquiry consumes considerable resources before the alleged breach of duty is analyzed and debated.

The Uniform Trust Code (UTC) attempts to provide a greater measure of certainty in this murky area with a bright-line five (5) year statute of repose (limitations). The UTC calls for a trust beneficiary to bring an action against a trustee for breach of trust within five (5) years of: (1) removal, resignation of death of trustee; (2) termination of the beneficiary’s interest; (3) termination of the trust.

Two issues arise from the UTC’s five-year rule. First, a trustee that fails to report to the beneficiaries or adequately disclose sufficient information may not be able to avail itself of the rule. Some view this as encouraging a trustee not to disclose.  Others believe the requiring the trustee to report annually is sufficient.  Second, it is unclear what state law exceptions apply to the five year rule of the UTC.

We expect that three (3) exceptions toll the UTC’s five (5) year rule. Fraud is one exception, however, is not a specified exception in the UTC. Unjust enrichment may or may not toll the statute from running. Finally, trust reformation may avoid the five-year rule.

What happens when an attorney represents a trustee who has breached a duty? Does the attorney protect the trustee as an individual or as a fiduciary? Would the trustee have the benefit of the five-year statute yet the trustee’s agent and attorneys might not?  So far, it appears the UTC does not cover attorneys.  Is the imputation of knowledge of an agent to the trustee enough to overcome the five-year rule and snare the trustee?

At times, it is difficult to draw a bright line through equity’s maze of duty and doctrines.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The United States implements the Affordable Health Care Act, FACTA, and a 3.8% Medicare tax, while other jurisdictions tout their advantages for business, finance and investment.  Clearly, the U.S. market is attractive in its own right which accounts for its take-it or leave-it attitude toward taxation incentives. Other jurisdictions, however, are not as fortunate and must develop attractive systems to encourage investment and the growth of its financial sector.

<a href="another-perspective-taxation" rel="attachment wp-att-3969"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3969" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/taxation-250x300.png" alt="taxation" width="200" height="240" /></a>Smaller countries look to the financial sector as a means of increasing their GDP and raising the standard of living. One example is Malta, situated inside the European Union (“EU”) and well-positioned to host holding companies, patent boxes and international finance subsidiaries. Malta has sixty-one (61) income tax treaties and is a member of the EU and may avail itself of the parent-subsidiary directive which permits dividends to pass free of tax in certain cases.

Malta’s Participation Exemption has an anti-abuse test and three safe harbors. One is a foreign company is incorporated or resident in the EU.  A second is if less than 50% of its income is from passive sources. Third, the foreign income is subject to tax at 15% rate or more. This test can be easily satisfied with proper planning.

Malta uses a management and control test so foreign entities as well as local companies may become resident. Malta has an imputation system of taxation which allows shareholders to claim tax credits and refunds for tax paid by the company with only 5% leakage. Passive income suffers leakage of about 10%, however, a 25% foreign tax credit and a 2/3 refund brings the rate to 6.25%.  A Maltese company may pay to a foreign individual or corporation without further withholding. This is a stark contrast to the US and FACTA.

Malta is a civil law jurisdiction but has enacted trust legislation to go with its statute on foundations. Trust income is subject to tax at 35%; however, the beneficiary may be able to claim a refund. Trust income arising outside of Malta and non-resident beneficiaries permits the income to escape Maltese tax provided there is no local trustee.

Many jurisdictions, including Malta, have special programs to attract high net worth individuals, register yachts and lease aircraft.

Maltese foundations have a unique feature called segregated cells, with each cell being taxed independently. A foundation may also elect to be taxed as a trust. Foundations are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/">treated as corporations for tax purposes</a>.</span>

Protected cell companies are creatures of Maltese law which permits the segregation of assets and liabilities in each cell. It offers a way of converting the character of income or delaying distributions up the chain. You may gain capital appreciation inside the wrapper of the cell.

If a company wants to leave Malta, there are no exit taxes. Consider Section 7874 on U.S. corporate inversions and one realizes Malta is different. There are no <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/cfcs-disregarded-entities-partnerships-subpart-f-income/">controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules in contrast to Subpart f</a>.</span>

There are many jurisdictions <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">seeking to accommodate business investment and the finance sector</a></span>. One can find suitable base for most any project given the options available.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[U.S. tax law requires businesses to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/federal-estate-tax-returns-could-cause-issues-for-some-businesses/"> file returns every year</a></span>, and if owners aren't careful, they could end up costing themselves a lot of money. The following are some money-saving  tax tips businesses can use during tax season.

<strong><a href="3-money-saving-tax-tips-businesses" rel="attachment wp-att-3975"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3975" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/businesses-300x272.jpg" alt="businesses" width="240" height="218" /></a></strong><strong>1. Contribute to a charity:</strong> When a business donates money to a charity, it isn't only showing good will. According to the Small Business Association, money, usable items, and other goods can be donated to claim a deduction for the fair market value on a tax return. However, business owners need to be sure to get proper documentation of the donation for the Internal Revenue Service so there is proof that items were actually donated.

<strong>2. Write off business expenses:</strong> Business owners will want to keep an accurate record expenses, as these can be<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/3-last-minute-tax-tips-business-owners/">written off come tax season</a></span>. According to Quote Roller, some of the most prevalent include home, office, car, and capital asset depreciation. Failing to take advantage of these deductions could lead a business to pay much more in taxes than necessary.

<strong>3. Keep records straight:</strong> One of the most important things a business can do during the year is keep its record straight. By doing this, there is less time spent during tax season coming up with the necessary documents to secure all the deductions and make sure information is accurate. As a result, a businesses' accountant will need less time, which translates to fewer billable hours, and money saved. It may seem like busy work at the time, but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> ensuring records are accurate</a></span> throughout the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/2013-year-in-review-top-tips-for-your-new-york-or-new-jersey-business/"> year can save money in the long run</a>.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Determining residency is a difficult task under a facts and circumstances test where the outcome may be subject to interpretation. The United Kingdom (U.K.) faces unique issues because of the existence of the Commonwealth and the mobility of residents between member states. The U.K. has fashioned tests designed to make clear whether an individual is a resident or non-resident for purposes of U.K. taxation.

<a href="residency-u-k-style" rel="attachment wp-att-3981"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3981" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/United-Kingdom-w250-h300.jpg" alt="United Kingdom" width="200" height="132" /></a>If one of three tests is satisfied, the individual will be a tax resident. An individual is a tax resident if he or she is present in the U.K. for 183 days in a year or has a home in the U.K.  The third test is satisfied if you were resident in the U.K. three of six years preceding death or have a home in the U.K.

The failure to satisfy these tests, you are left with the “sufficient ties” test, which looks at a combination of factors with the number of days spent in the U.K.

The non-resident automatic tests are (i) 183 days in the U.K.; (ii) one has not been a resident in the U.K. for the past three years and spend less than forty-six (46) days in the year in question.

There are four ties. The family tie is a spouse or civil union partner or child under 18 in the U.K.  The accommodation tie, if you have a place to live or available to you in the U.K.  The third tie is work in the U.K. for forty days. Fourth is if you spent 90 days in the U.K. in the current or preceding year. There is a fifth test if you are resident in the U.K. in the prior three years.  You count the number of days spent in the U.K. and if more than days spent in any other country.

The United States has separate rules for federal income taxation (“FIT”) and for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning/">federal estate taxation</a></span> (“FET”). A lawful permanent resident is generally a resident from the start of the year in which he is physically present in the U.S., while holding a permanent residence visa (green card).  If the lawful permanent resident satisfied the substantial presence test and green card test, residency begins on the earlier date.  The rules are a bit more detailed and complex than the overview. A Resident Alien is taxable as either (i) a lawful permanent resident; (ii) satisfies the substantial presence test and does not qualify for the exception under the closer connection with another country; or (iii)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning/"> elects to be taxed as a U.S. resident</a>.</span>

Non-resident aliens, physically present in the United States for 183 days or more in the current year or who satisfy the “lookback test” are subject to FIT. The later requires the individual to be present for 31 days in the current year and for 183 days or more over the sum of the current year, one-third of the days in the preceding year and one-sixth of the second preceding year.

FET and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/">Gift tax</a></span> focuses on domicile and the test is broader in scope. A person acquires domicile by residing in a place, even for a brief period of time, with no definite intention of remaining. I observe that ascertaining the intent of a decedent can be difficult. This places a premium on planning.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax season is officially here, which means individuals and business owners will begin to file returns. The Internal Revenue Service is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/businesses-can-avoid-audited/">stringent when reviewing these documents</a></span>, which is why companies will want to avoid the common missteps made on business tax returns:

<strong><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/common-errors-business-tax-returns/business-tax-return/" rel="attachment wp-att-3989"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3989" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-tax-return.jpg" alt="business-tax-return" width="294" height="172" /></a>Filing the wrong form</strong>
Business taxes aren't as simple as income taxes, as there are multiple different forms that are used. According to the Small Business Association, filing with the wrong form is one of the most common mistakes made by companies. For example, businesses could file for a deduction that it wasn't eligible for, which will certainly get the attention of the IRS, and potentially lead to issues down the road.

<strong>Not using a tax professional</strong>
Making mistakes on a tax return is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/2013-year-in-review-top-tips-for-your-new-york-or-new-jersey-business/">something all businesses want to avoid</a></span>, as the IRS is not an organization that is to be messed with. According to the Huffington Post, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">using a tax professional is essential</a></span>, as these people can help ensure that filing taxes goes off without a hitch. This move will<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/3-money-saving-tax-tips-businesses/"> cost businesses some money</a></span>, but it could end up saving them in the long run by avoiding costly errors on their return.

<strong>Missed tax credits</strong>
Many businesses have to pay a high tax bill. However, there are ways that it can be reduced, such as by using tax credits. Missing certain credits on a return is a major mistake that businesses will want to avoid. Therefore, it is probably a good idea to begin the process early, so all options can be explored. Of course, companies should also avoid filing for credits they don't qualify for as this can lead to issues in the future.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When a person passes away, the assets left for his or her family is generally <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=estate+tax">subject to the estate tax</a></span>. However, there are certain breaks that can help these people reduce this tax bill.

<a href="irs-extends-estate-tax-break" rel="attachment wp-att-3999"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3999" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tax-break-300x270.jpg" alt="tax-break" width="240" height="216" /></a>According to Forbes, the Internal Revenue Service recently announced it is extending the time to take advantage of a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/taxpayers-can-expect-bigger-estate-tax-credits-2014/"> key estate tax break </a></span>made available for married couples. The extensions give widows and widowers more time to carry over the estate tax exemption of their spouse who died and add it to their own. Married couples are able to transfer $5.34 million each without taxes.

In order for this break to be taken advantage of, tax law outlines that the executor of the estate needs to file a tax return within nine months of the death, even if there is no tax due on the estate.

Estate taxes have been making waves recently, as a few states are looking to provide some sort of relief. According to The Washington Post, leaders of the Maryland General Assembly recently outlined plans to reduce the estate tax, as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">offer tax credits</a></span> to help benefit businesses around colleges and universities.

One of the biggest motivators for states to provide relief is to keep retirees from moving somewhere that has less harsh tax laws. This is especially important with many <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/are-new-jersey-businesses-more-optimistic-entering-2013/">state economies still struggling</a> </span>to fully recover from the recession.

"As we come out of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression, we need to rebuild our private sector confidence to invest and expand in Maryland's economy," House Speaker Michael Busch said at a news conference.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[It has been five years since Michael Jackson passed away, and that time has been filled with multiple controversies. It appears as though that is going to continue, as the King of Pop's estate and the Internal Revenue Service are currently in a battle over how much his estate was worth at the time of his death.

<a href="irs-wants-heavily-tax-michael-jacksons-estate" rel="attachment wp-att-4011"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4011" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Michael-Jackson.png" alt="Michael Jackson" width="240" height="240" /></a>Tax law requires that Jackson's estate be charged based on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/taxpayers-can-expect-bigger-estate-tax-credits-2014/">current estate tax rate</a></span>, however, there is some confusion over just how much he was worth. The IRS recently informed Jackson's executors that the estate owes $505 million in taxes and another $197 million in penalties, according to the Los Angeles Times.

When Jackson passed away, the executors of his estate claimed his net worth was around $7 million, but the IRS said it was $1.125 billion, which is the reason for the big tax bill. In addition to the $505 million in taxes owed, the IRS claimed that the inaccuracy was so great that the estate is charged a gross valuation misstatement penalty, which allows the government to double the 20 percent penalty for underpayment.

"This is something unusual," <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">estate tax expert</a> </span>Andrew Katzenstein told the news source. "He was one of the premier entertainers of our time. So there are really no comparables, and it leaves the valuation question open to a huge range of possibilities. Do I think his likeness was worth $2,105? No. But was it worth $400 million?"

According to Time Magazine, the Jackson estate could go a couple routes to pay off this tax bill. It might sell of some assets, or it could ask for a payment plan of around 15 years.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/">Gift and estate tax laws</a> allow Americans to make tax free gifts up to a certain amount. According to Bloomberg, Congress voted in December 2010 to increase that limit to $5 million for wealthy Americans, which led to a significant spike in the following years.

<a href="tax-free-gifts-increased-u-s" rel="attachment wp-att-4006"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4006" alt="gift-free-tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gift-free-tax-300x250.jpg" width="240" height="200" /></a>In 2012, U.S. taxpayers reported making $122 billion in nontaxable gifts, which is more than four times the amount seen in the past two years, Internal Revenue Service data showed. Much of this <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/concerned-about-how-taxes-may-impact-your-wealth-check-out-scarinci-hollenbecks-new-video-series/">money came from the richest Americans</a>, as $84 billion was in the form of gifts higher than $1 million, which were made by fewer than 30,000 people.

Lisa Featherngill, managing director at Abbot Downing - a <a href="/the-plight-of-billionaires-looking-for-new-havens-to-shield-assets/">wealth-management</a> unit of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. - told Bloomberg that wealthy Americans jumped at the chance to make tax-free gifts when Congress raised the limit.

"There was a huge scramble after 2010 to take advantage of the new law," she said. "There was concern that the law was going to revert."

Featherngill said she has six direct clients who have at least $50 million in investable assets, and all made large tax-free gifts in 2011 or 2012.

As of this year, the exemption amount is at $5.34 million, according to the Motley Fool, which means that very few people will actually have to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">worry about estate tax</a>. However, even those that have an estate of more than $5.34 million can get around - or significantly reduce - their tax bill with some planning. For example, taxpayers can donate money to charities instead of paying it to the federal government.]]></content>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bell - who most recently participated in ABC's diving competition "Splash" - reportedly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/bankruptcy-and-creditors-rights/">filed for bankruptcy</a></span>. It is said that he has debts that total $581,000, which includes back taxes. While the 26-year-old made $408,000 in 2012, that number dropped to just $14,099 in 2013. With expenses totaling $18,771, Bell found himself in <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/">f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">inancial trouble</span></a>.</p>
If you owe back taxes like bell, there are several options available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax bill payments:</strong> According to the IRS, people who are unable to pay their full tax bill would be wise to secure a loan to pay in full rather than make installment payments. The IRS will charge late fees and penalties, which could be more expensive than the interest charged on a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for an extension: </strong>Depending on the circumstances, people can ask for additional time to pay their tax bill in full. This can be secured using the Online Payment Agreement application, which can be found at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.irs.gov">www.irs.gov</a></span>. However, this option isn't made available to everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Installment agreement:</strong> People who are unable to pay in full, and don't want to take out a loan, can request an installment agreement through the IRS. This means the person who owes back taxes will have to pay the amount due each month or face additional financial penalties.</li>

		<content><![CDATA[Wealth preservation remains a challenge despite the increases in the federal estate tax exclusion, which is equal to $5,340,000 in 2014.  The challenge comes from  higher trust income tax rates.  Taxpayers have, over the years, funded trusts with gifts of property with carryover basis. Over time, inflation and appreciation increased the fair market value (FMV) of property in excess of basis. The planning paradigm for years was to transfer future appreciation to the next generation either outright or in trust. Today, the government’s target is the income tax resulting from the sale of low basis property held in trust.  The federal estate tax rate is 40% and trust income tax rate is 39.6% on $12,150 of taxable income plus the 3.8% surcharge makes income tax. New Jersey taxes trust income up at a rate of 8.97% on $500,000 of income.  Thus, the effective income tax rate exceeds the estate tax rate.  It is no wonder that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/is-income-tax-planning-now-more-important-than-estate-tax-planning/">income tax planning</a></span> for trusts is so important.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/trusts-income-tax-planning-important-now/2013-form-1040-f1040pdf-mozilla-firefox/" rel="attachment wp-att-4030"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4030" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2013-Form-1040-f1040pdf-Mozilla-Firefox-300x49.png" alt="Income Tax" width="300" height="49" /></a>Consider that property transferred by gift to a trust has carryover basis. Credit shelter or bypass trusts established by a Will may have been funded years ago. Although assets obtained a stepped-up basis at that time, there may now have substantial appreciation, and thus face hefty income taxes. Various techniques are being examined for the potential to increase basis and thereby reduce the income tax bite. Planning with Grantor trusts, particularly those trusts giving the grantor the power to substitute assets of equivalent value, involved the switch low basis assets out of trust and into the hands of individuals who will provide a step-up to FMV at death.  Not all trusts contain grantor trust powers or give the power to a responsible person. In other instances, the estate tax exclusion of the very wealthy may be insufficient to offset estate tax if assets are substituted. For these and other reasons other techniques are considered.

One technique involves triggering the Delaware Tax Trap (“DTT”). Any discussion of the technique requires an explanation of the common law Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP), the DTT and its consequences falling into the trap. The RAP states that property must vest (come out of trust) within lives in being plus 21 years. States have enacted statutory variations of the RAP. The common law RAP was intended to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prevent perpetual trust</span>s </a>but today’s statutory enactments have a tax component.  The DTT is triggered when a holder of a special power of appointment (First Power) creates a power in another person (Second Power) which postpones vesting.  When the DTT is triggered, any property subject to the First Power must be included in the <a href="/advantages-gift-tax-law/">estate and gift base</a> to the person exercising the First Power.

Unlike other states, Delaware measured the RAP from the date of creation of the new power. In effect, Delaware restarted the clock upon each exercise so property could remain in trust and not violate the RAP.  Congress, offended by revenue loss from property remaining outside the estate and gift tax system in perpetuity, eliminated this possibility. When the federal estate tax exclusion was much lower, triggering the DTT caused severe harm.

Today, triggering the DTT may not be an issue if the individual exercising the First Power has sufficient estate tax and Generation Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) exclusions to offset those taxes. Thus, if a person exercising the First Power has sufficient unused or excess estate and GSTT exclusions, trust property will receive a basis step-up and can be sold without income taxation.

Finally, not all states have a RAP statute that resets the clock and triggers the DTT.  Some states measure from the date of the original trust, not the exercise of the power and thus do not rigger the DTT.  Therefore, any use of this technique depends heavily on state law.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Offshore tax evasion is a clear <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">violation of tax law</a></span>, and this topic will be the focus of a Senate hearing that will take place in the near future. According to Bloomberg, the <a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/the-united-states-constitution/#TCAmendment1">U.S. Senate </a>Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing on a crackdown of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=offshore+tax+evasion">offshore tax evasion</a></span>, and will focus on "the status of efforts to hold Swiss banks and their U.S. clients accountable for unpaid taxes on billions of dollars in hidden assets," a statement by the committee said.

<a href="senate-hearing-address-offshore-tax-evasion" rel="attachment wp-att-4038"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4038" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/off-shore-tax-evasion-300x198.jpg" alt="off shore tax evasion" width="300" height="198" /></a>Credit Suisse Group is one of the banks that will be focused on, as U.S. prosecutors claim they have evidence showing bankers helped customers buy gold bars to store in Swiss bank safes, among other things, according to CNN Money. Credit Suisse is among the 14 Swiss banks that are being investigated by the Justice Department.

Kathryn Keneally, the assistant attorney general overseeing the tax division, told CNN Money that people with accounts in Swiss banks should not be under the impression they will remain secret.

"If someone had an account in Switzerland, it is beyond foolish to think that that account is going to remain secret," Keneally said. "In the last five years, we've seen a remarkable change in our ability to get information concerning Swiss bank accounts. It's extraordinary. Switzerland is no longer a good place to hide assets for tax reasons."

The break that started the run on Swiss bank accounts came in 2009, when U.S. prosecutors charged UBS AG with aiding tax evasion, Bloomberg reported. The bank avoided prosecution by paying $780 million, and admitting it helped more than 250 accounts with tax evasion.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Passing on money, property and other assets to family members is a great way to ensure they are financially secure. However, people will want to be sure the tax levied on their estate is as small as possible.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/reduce-eliminate-estate-tax-bill/estate-tax-001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4204"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4204" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/estate-tax-0011-300x300.jpg" alt="Estate" width="240" height="240" /></a>The following are some steps that  people can take to reduce what is charged by estate tax law:

<strong>Create an irrevocable trust for life insurance policies:</strong> Most people have<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/insurance-recovery-liability/">life insurance policies</a></span> to provide their families with financial security when they pass away, and the policyholder will have this insurance included in his or her estate. By creating an irrevocable trust, the policy can be removed from a person's gross estate, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">reduces the potential estate taxes.</a></span>

<strong>Consider generation skipping: </strong>If allowed, generation skipping can save people money on estate taxes. This gives people the ability to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/4-steps-successful-estate-planning/">transfer a portion of their assets</a></span> to their grandchildren as opposed to their immediate children, which saves them from being taxed twice. Without generation skipping, assets would be taxed when being transferred to children, and then from them to their children.

<strong>Use tax-free gifts:</strong> One of the best ways to reduce an estate tax bill is by using <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=gift+tax">tax-free gifts</a></span>. Federal law enables people to give up to $13,000 each year to as many recipients as possible. Any more that is given to a single person will be considered a taxable gift and applied to the gifter's estate tax exemption.

Without taking advantage of these strategies, people could end up leaving loved ones with a large tax bill, so these are important to consider while estate planning.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Reorganizations under IRC §368(a)(1)(F) (“F Reorganizations”) are mere changes in form, such as changing a state of incorporation.  This change may be made for any number of reasons, although choice of law or no longer doing business in the state are common.  F Reorganizations in the international context involve consideration of many more substantive issues.

<a href="change-form-f-reorganizations-foreign-context" rel="attachment wp-att-4212"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4212" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/F-Reorganizatoins-0011-300x300.jpg" alt="F-Reorganizatoins" width="240" height="240" /></a>One must consider international tax law as the backdrop. PLR 201328003 sets forth a factual background of a structure used in international settings. It involves a foreign entity that has several subsidiaries, all of whom are disregarded.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">Taxpayers may obtain a  benefit</a></span> from making the check-the-box election to convert a foreign business entity into an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes (DRE). DREs allow taxpayers to navigate the complex world of international taxation more efficiently. Consider that Subpart F taxes income that is not derived from an active trade or business or is re-routed through or to tax advantaged jurisdictions. The essence of the Subpart F regime is the taxation of income that is not repatriated, for whatever reason, to the U.S.  Another set of rules faced by corporations is the foreign tax credit (FTC). The U.S. taxes worldwide income, which includes income earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions. The FTC brings with it certain computational difficulties and limitations.

Some complexity can be eliminated through the use of DRE.  PLR 201328003 describes such a DRE structure that was crafted to adapt to these rules.  Foreign parent (“FP”) owns Target which is formed under the laws of a foreign country. Target owns several subsidiaries. Target filed to domesticate itself in a state, which was a taxable transaction. Despite the inbound taxable event, the tiered subsidiaries were all disregarded entities.  DREs are branches of the parent, in this case the Target. One of the unique features of DRE’s is that they allow what is, in effect, consolidated return groups to be formed across borders.  The benefit of this feature is the ability of a corporation to combine activities of entities in several different countries to avoid, to a degree, Subpart F and FTC.

Some jurisdictions allow for cross-border consolidations and advertise this attractive feature. Although the U.S. does not permit consolidated groups to include non-U.S. companies, use of DRE’s accomplishes the same.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Businesses face many taxes, but a Senate-approved plan in the Indiana House could provide some relief to companies in the state. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, lawmakers are considering amendments that would overhaul the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/real-property-tax-appeals/">plan for cutting the property tax </a></span>on business equipment.

<a href="indiana-michigan-changing-business-tax-laws" rel="attachment wp-att-4222"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4222" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Indiana-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Indiana" width="240" height="240" /></a>The biggest challenge facing Indiana lawmakers is finding a happy medium between cutting the personal property tax without hurting local budgets. One proposal outlines a plan that would cut the corporate income tax from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent, and eliminate tax credits. Another proposal would allow counties to decide whether or not to cut taxes.

Michigan lawmakers recently announced a plan similar to the one proposed in Indiana. According to MLive, the plan is aimed at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/is-the-sale-price-of-a-residence-determinative-of-its-true-value-for-purposes-of-real-property-tax-assessments/">personal property tax reform</a></span>, which is considered to be a win-win for businesses and local governments.

"Changing a very uncompetitive, outdated tax structure has been a top priority of this administration right from the beginning," Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who spearheaded negotiations on the new proposal, said following a morning press conference. "And so this package accomplishes that, but the other thing it does is help stabilize, and I think long-term improve, local<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/?s=IRS">government revenue </a></span>streams as well."

The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation within a week's time, with the House following suit in March. Should it make it to the ballot, there is expected to be widespread support. States such as Indiana and Michigan are smart to introduce <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">favorable business tax laws</a>, as keeping companies in-state can help boost the state economy. This is important, as some areas are still struggling from the recession experienced in 2007 and 2008.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A Graegin Loan is one obtained by an estate to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/focus-on-death-taxes-continues-as-indiana-drops-law/">pay death taxes</a></span> and administration fees.  Typically, court approval of the transaction is necessary for the loan to be considered necessary for the administration of the estate.  Once that hurdle is cleared, the interest expense is deductible which is of considerable benefit.  Estates that are illiquid or faced with depressed market conditions for its assets are good candidates for the technique.  There are, however, complications that may arise from use of the technique.

<a href="estate-hughes-graegin-loan-great-result" rel="attachment wp-att-4226"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4226" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Graegin-Loan-001-207x300.jpg" alt="Graegin-Loan" width="207" height="300" /></a>In 2000, Mark Hughes, founder of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.herbalife.com/">Herbal Life</a></span> (the “Company”) died testate leaving everything to a trust. The trust, in turn, provided for several specific bequests of Company stock, including one to his son who was also the beneficiary of the remaining trust assets. The gross estate was $300 million and the tax bill was $212 million. The tax clause charged each bequest and the residuary with its <i>pro rata</i> share of the tax bill.  Most of the trust assets were in limited liability companies and the trust could not compel distributions.  The source of the Graegin loan was a family partnership that loaned $50 million to a limited liability company that on-loaned the funds to estate with a slight spread.  Both loans were zero coupon.  The loan to the estate created an interest deduction of $49 million and an estate tax savings of $166 million.

Due to a merger and sale of Company, cash was distributed from the trust based upon a figure of $19.50 per share rather than the fair market value FMV of Company stock in an attempt to strike a balance between the interests of the son and the other recipients of bequests. The Graegin transaction brought with it certain income tax consequences because only the trust (passing to the son) would benefit from the estate tax deduction for administration expenses.  Thus, the California probate court approved estate tax proration based upon market value, not the $19.50 distribution figure.

The Appellate Court reversed stating that the probate statute did not contemplate the consideration of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=income+tax"> future income tax consequences</a></span>.  Although the estate tax interest deduction on the return will cause the son to recognize income in future years, future income tax rates and tax brackets are too uncertain.  Although the estate tax savings was $166 million, the income tax cost was $49 million leaving the trust with a $113 million net savings.

Plans that use Graegin Loans should<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">consider the income tax implications</a></span>.  If the residuary were charged with all of the tax proration litigation may have been avoided.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers are currently considering changes to the Empire State's estate tax law. If passed, one of the biggest benefits would be an increase to the estate tax exemption from $1 million to $5.25 million by 2019, which means New Yorkers could pass on assets to children worth $5.25 million without paying taxes.

<a href="new-york-estate-tax-law-change-hurt-home-gifting" rel="attachment wp-att-4234"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4234" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="Estate Tax" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/estate-tax-0012-300x300.jpg" width="306" height="306" /></a>However, there is expected to be some downsides to the new law as well. For example, it could be more difficult for people to gift houses. According to Newsday, all taxable gifts, including houses, would be counted as part of a person's estate for tax purposes after they die. Additionally, if the property s sold for more than what the owner originally paid, there would be a capital gains tax of around 30 percent on top of the estate tax.

With this in mind, it is recommended that New Yorkers gift homes before the law is implemented if passed, which would be as early as April 1. Experts say that wealthy homeowners should do their research before making any moves though.

Despite the fact that homeowner's may have additional hurdles when gifting a property, the estate tax law changes are supported by many. Wall Street millionaires, middle class families and small business owners all support the law. The current estate tax doesn't only impact the super rich, which is why the exemption increase from $1 million to $5.25 million would be a major achievement for all New Yorkers.

The state will benefit from this move as well, with Cuomo stating that the goal is to keep New York retirees at home instead of flocking to states such as Florida.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Tax evasion is currently a major topic of conversation, with a Senate Hearing in the near future<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/private-swiss-bank-closes-over-tax-evasion-dispute-with-u-s/"> focusing on Swiss banks</a></span>. In another major move, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said that Australia has agreed to sign a tax evasion agreement, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. The U.S. and Australia have yet to sign the agreement, but plan to do so at the G-20 summit

<a href="u-s-australia-agree-battle-tax-evasion" rel="attachment wp-att-4248"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4248" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Australia1-300x300.jpg" alt="Tax Evasion" width="270" height="270" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/amendment-16/">Tax law </a></span>strictly prohibits <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=foreign+banks">storing money in foreign bank accounts </a></span>to avoid taxes, but that hasn't stopped people in the past. This agreement with Australia is a good step toward reducing the amount of safe havens people have to avoid being taxed.

Australia has agreed to terms based on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires financial institutions to report on<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> information about accounts held by U.S. tax payers </a>to the Internal Revenue Service.

"Automatic exchange of information has quickly become the new global standard," said Lew, who's in Sydney, Australia to attend a meeting of finance ministers from G-20 major economies. "The G-20 should continue to provide its full support and encourage all nations to adopt the standard."

Australian treasurer Joe Hockey said in a meeting with Lew that he hopes the G-20 nations can come up with methods to "ensure that there is a greater transparency and better outcomes in the disclosure of tax liabilities and tax collections."

With the Senate Hearing on Swiss banks coming up, and this agreement between the U.S. and Australia, it is becoming more difficult for people to store funds in offshore accounts for tax purposes. But, there are still plenty of nations that accept these funds, so there is likely a long way to go before offshore-tax evasion is a thing of the past.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[President Barack Obama recently announced a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill to repair the nation's aging roads, rails, bridges and tunnels. According to The New York Times, one method Obama plans to use to fund this initiative is a business tax overhaul.

<a href="federal-business-tax-overhaul-fund-infrastructure-projects" rel="attachment wp-att-4252"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4252" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/business-tax-overhaul-001-300x300.jpg" alt="business-tax-overhaul" width="270" height="270" /></a>In the State of the Union Address, Obama said he would use the money from the tax changes to "create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes, because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure."

The proposal would help avoid repeated short-term extensions that many construction projects have experienced in recent years, and would help protect 700,000 jobs, according to USA Today.

Changes to<a href="/?s=business+tax"> b<span style="text-decoration: underline;">usiness tax law</span></a> that would help fund the infrastructure projects would include<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> closing tax loopholes</a></span>, lowering tax rates and making the corporate tax system more fair, the Department of Transportation said.

Some businesses may not be happy with the government closing tax loopholes, as this could mean they have higher tax bills. However, lowering rates could help ease the pain of this move.

Raising the gas tax was also explored, but Obama believes the corporate tax overhaul should be enough to fund the projects. The gas tax currently sits at 18.4 cents per gallon, and hasn't been increased since 1993. This brings in about $39 billion annually, which, alone, isn't enough to fund infrastructure projects.

One of the biggest benefits that could be experienced by this move is the protection of jobs. The White House said more than 700,000 jobs could be put in jeopardy is these projects aren't properly funded.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Bitcoin is an unregulated currency that has made a big splash in the economy during the past couple of years. At first, it was the chosen form of payment for black market dealings, but more and more legitimate merchants are beginning to accept <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/mt-gox-insolvency-may-lead-bankruptcy/">Bitcoin</a>.</span>

<a href="tax-issues-hurt-bitcoin" rel="attachment wp-att-4259"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4259" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bitcoins5-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Bitcoins" width="240" height="240" /></a>According to Entrepreneur.com, Overstock and TigerDirect have already begun accepting the currency, and more are expected to follow suit.

"One great beacon here is major retailers like Overstock - and there have been others - hopping onboard," Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of the Bitcoin exchange and wallet service Coinbase, told the news source. "There are others of similar stature in the pipeline."

However,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> tax law issues</a></span> could prevent some merchants from accepting Bitcoin. According to Forbes, businesses have to collect and remit sales tax no matter what type of currency is being used, as well as state and federal income tax on annual profits. Unfortunately, the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=IRS"> Internal Revenue Service</a></span> hasn't said much on the topic, which could leave merchants in a grey area when it comes to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/questions-taxation-bitcoins-becomes-pressing/">accepting the currency</a>.</span>

One of the biggest issues is that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/mt-gox-insolvency-may-lead-bankruptcy/">no taxing organization accepts Bitcoin as payment</a>.</span> For this reason, it must be converted into U.S. dollars in order to calculate the amount of taxes due. In certain situations, this means that merchants are calculating amounts in fractions of Bitcoin, which can create confusion.

Businesses that use Bitcoin in Australia are about to be targeted by the Australian Taxation Office to crack down on undisclosed capital gains, according to BRW, and it should only be a matter of time before the same happens in the U.S.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Many taxpayers rush to file their returns as soon as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=IRS">Internal Revenue Service</a></span> begins accepting them, but others take their time to ensure they are <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">receiving all possible tax breaks</a>. The following are some of the most overlooked breaks:

<strong><a href="4-overlooked-tax-breaks" rel="attachment wp-att-4272"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4272" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tax-Breaks-300x225.jpg" alt="Tax-Breaks" width="240" height="180" /></a>1. Charitable gifts</strong>
<a href="/?s=gift+tax+law"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gift tax law</span> </a>allows people to make monetary contributions to charity, which can be deducted on their tax returns. In addition to these donations, any supplies purchased while volunteering can also be deducted. For example, people who use their car to help a charity may be able to deduct the cost of gas. The IRS allows 14 cents per mile for this type of travel.

<strong>2. Job-hunting costs</strong>
One of the most overlooked tax deductions is the money people spend when<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/sec-proposes-new-rules-under-the-jobs-act/">searching for a job</a></span>. Whether they were laid off, or are searching for a better opportunity, it is important that these expenses are tracked. They can include transportation, food and lodging, car fare, employment agency fees, and even costs of printing resumes and business cards.

<strong>3. Moving expenses</strong>
People who moved in the past year can potentially take advantage of an additional tax deduction. The majority of these costs can be written off when relocating for a job. Recent college grads that move from where they are from to take a job can deduct moving expenses as well.

<strong>4. Child care credit</strong>
Taxpayers who have children should look into the child care credit. This can help pay for the cost of after-school day car if both parents have to work. It can also be used for child care cost during the summer, which can cover summer day camp expenses.]]></content>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Businesses in the state of Indiana could see tax law change in the coming months, as legislation is currently moving through the Senate and House.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><a href="indiana-making-changes-business-tax-law" rel="attachment wp-att-4283"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4283" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tax-Law-200x300.png" alt="Tax Law" width="160" height="240" /></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">According to the NWI Times, Senate Bill 1 would permit counties to eliminate the business personal property  tax on new equipment, which could help keep companies in state, as their tax bills are reduced. Counties that don't eliminate this would be able to </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">abate business personal property taxe</span></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/scarinci-hollenbecks-tax-video-series-can-help-business-owners-manage-their-wealth/">s</a> for 25 years and reduce the state corporate income tax rate from 7 percent to 4.9 percent by 2023. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Another piece of legislation that could change business tax law is SB 176, which aims to help six central Indiana counties to raise taxes to help fund the expansion of the mass transit system, according to MyDesert.com. If passed, the hope is that the bill would ensure the business community covers 10 percent of the system's operating costs through a new corporate income or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/department-of-justice-considers-personal-benefit-an-important-factor-in-prosecuting-employment-tax-cases/">employment tax</a>. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Indiana needs to be careful when deciding on how much to tax businesses to help fund the mass transit system, as too big of an increase could lead them to pack up shop and move to another state. This is the last thing Indiana wants, as losing businesses because of a higher tax bill could damage the state's economy. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">Business owners understand that taxes can increase from year to year</a></span>, but drastic jumps should be avoided. For this reason, the approval of SB 1, which offers tax cuts, could be essential if SB 176 is passed, as this can offer additional tax cuts as other taxes are bumped up. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[President Barack Obama is planning a tax increase on U.S. multinational businesses that would add <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/03/05/how-corporate-america-is-losing-the-debate-on-taxes/" target="_blank">a total of $276 billion</a></span> to the U.S. budget, according to The Washington Post. The 2015 plan includes six new measures to plug leaks in the tax code that multinationals are using to avoid paying the 35 percent federal corporate tax rate imposed by the U.S. government - the highest in the industrial world.

<a title="By Nilington [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AWhite_House_from_South.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/White_House_from_South.jpg/512px-White_House_from_South.jpg" alt="White House from South" width="512" /></a>Both sides of the debate want changes to the tax code. Corporate executives have been arguing for years for a reduction in the tax rate, but those in favor of the President's plan argue that most multinationals don't pay the 35 percent rate anyway, by exploiting loopholes in the tax code. GE, for example, reported that it only paid an effective tax rate of 4.2 percent in it's most recent annual filing, according to the news source.

MSN Money explained that the plan <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=BLOOM&amp;date=20140305&amp;id=17407803" target="_blank">isn't likely to find any traction</a></span> in a congress that has trouble agreeing even on general tax policy, let alone specifics. Manal Corwin, national leader of the international tax practice at KPMG LLP in Washington, explained to the news source that, in actuality, the plan is intended to set down a marker in the national tax debate.

"I don't know that anybody's predicting that we're suddenly going to see tax reform happen," said Corwin. "There are certain themes that seem to be repeating themselves."

Under the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">current tax code</a></span>, U.S.-based multinationals face a full 35 percent tax rate for income they make around the world after the tax they pay to local governments. As other countries have reduced their tax rates, businesses have stockpiled an estimated $2 trillion in untaxed, offshore profits. While some feel that the U.S. should lower its tax rates in order to encourage businesses to repatriate their money, others feel that the loopholes through which these businesses are avoiding the tax should be closed.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[There hasn't been a major reform of corporate tax law in almost three decades, and with good reason - neither party agrees on which way to push the needle. However, recent developments in Washington suggest that both parties <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bipartisan-fail-tax-reform" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may be moving toward agreemen</span>t</a> in some key areas, according to MSNBC. Both President Barack Obama and Michigan Rep. David Camp, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, want to close some corporate tax loopholes.

<a href="bipartisan-move-toward-corporate-tax-reform" rel="attachment wp-att-4297"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4297" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Corporate-001-300x300.png" alt="Corporate Tax" width="300" height="300" /></a>The president and Camp also both want to use the money gained by closing these loopholes to lower the corporate tax rate, which is currently 35 percent of gross income, according to the news source. The president released his plan earlier this week, while Camp released his last week.

A senior Treasury Department official<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.crescent-news.com/editors%20pick/2014/03/05/analysis-philosophy-aside-both-sides-creeping-toward-corporate-tax-revamp" target="_blank">told reporters on the condition of anonymity</a></span> that, while "obviously we don't agree on everything," the two plans are, "within shouting distance of each other," according to The Cresent-News. White House budget director Sylvia Burwell also suggested that there were some similarities between the proposals.

Camp, however, does not agree that the proposals are all that similar, according to the news source.

"Our plan to close loopholes and lower rates for all Americans would add $3.4 trillion to the economy, create nearly 2 million jobs and put $1,300 more per year in the pockets of middle-class Americans," he said in a statement. "Unfortunately, the president's budget adds more<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/bankruptcy-and-creditors-rights/">complexity to the tax code </a></span>and increases taxes for more Washington spending. That is the wrong direction."

While a number of groups feel that lowering the corporate tax rate with the money gained from closing loopholes is out of line with liberal goals, others feel that in general, lowering the corporate tax rate in America will reduce incentives for multinational companies to offshore their profits.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[While many reliable sources in Washington are saying that the odds of either President Obama's <a href="/white-house-budget-takes-276-billion-multinationals/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate tax reform bil</span>l</a> or Republican Camp's bill getting passed this year are slim to none, some states aren't waiting to conduct their own reform. According to Pew Reports, a number of states are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/hunting-lost-revenue-in-offshore-tax-havens-85899541744" target="_blank">targeting offshore "tax havens"</a></span> in new litigation that will allow them to recoup the more than $20 billion that they lose to the technique each year.

<a href="states-pursue-offshore-tax-free-income" rel="attachment wp-att-4311"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4311" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/offshore-001-300x197.jpg" alt="offshore" width="240" height="158" /></a>By shifting income to offshore subsidiaries in places like the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=Cayman+Islands">Cayman Islands, Bermuda</a></span> and a number of other tax havens, companies are able to avoid paying both state taxes and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/armour-v-indianapolis-do-unequal-taxes-violate-the-constitution/">federal taxes</a> </span>in the U.S., where the marginal rate is significantly higher, according to the news source. While technically these companies are required to pay U.S. taxes when they repatriate the money, there is currently no limit on how long they can defer repatriation. This may serve as a disincentive for investing in U.S. labor, construction or goods, because the money can only be spent abroad.

Maine is now looking at litigation that will mirror tax law enacted in Montana in 2004, according to Pew Reports. The bill being considered would name 38 known tax havens and attempt to put a stop to incentives to move money to them.

Robert Pozen, a reporter with The Wall Street Journal, has<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579366900326408522" target="_blank">a different plan</a></span> for recovering the tax on the estimated $2 trillion held abroad. He suggests a transitional tax rate on foreign profits of 12 percent, which would lead into a foreign "competitiveness" tax of 17 percent, which would only come into effect after local international taxes. For example, if local taxes amounted to 15 percent, for example, the tax owed to the U.S. would be only 2 percent.

There are a number of ideas present in Washington, D.C., and in state governments as to what should be done about the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">corporate tax problem</a>, but it is unlikely that the U.S. will see a change any time soon.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The financial advisory firm Regent Atlantic as to why wealthy people leave New Jersey to reside in other states. The report is entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.regentatlantic.com/File%20Library/Tax%20paper/Exodus-on-the-Parkway-2-25-14-FINAL-VERSION.pdf"><i>Exodus on the Parkway: Are Taxes Driving Wealthy Residents Out of New Jersey?</i> </a></span>(the “Report”).  The Report draws on objective statistical information and is free of the hyperbole that often accompanies such discussions.

<img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wealthy-001.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" />The Report notes that the State of New Jersey (the “State”) obtains 39% of its revenue from its gross income tax. There are states that have no personal income tax, notably Florida and Nevada. The highest marginal rate is 8.97% and it is easy to understand how attractive this annual savings is to an upper bracket taxpayer. The Report states that between 2004 and 2008, $70 billion of wealth left New Jersey and $5.5 billion of wealth departed in 2010.  This<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> trend shifts the tax burden to those persons remaining in the State.</a></span>

The Report notes the disparity between the operation of federal income tax rules as compared to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/thats-it-were-splitting-up-the-disconnect-between-the-new-jersey-gross-income-tax-and-the-federal-income-tax/">New Jersey Gross Income Tax</a></span> (GIT) rules. There are two significant differences.  First, that State loss carry-forwards are limited to income from categories that are more narrowly drawn.  A client had carryover losses from a business that she was unable to offset against gain on the disposition of real property for GIT. Although netting resulted in no federal income tax, the State tax was in six figures. Second, State loss carry forwards rules are more restrictive than in the federal system.

A second difference is between the federal estate tax and the New Jersey estate tax and is more widely known. The federal estate tax exemption in 2014 is $5,340,000 per person, while the New Jersey exemption remains at $675,000.  Although an estate may be at the cusp of the federal exemption with no federal estate tax payable; New Jersey demands approximately $430,000 in New Jersey estate tax. It is no wonder wealthy people choose to leave the State and establish domicile in more favorable tax climates.

More importantly is that the assets of state residents falling below the $5,340,000 level are subject to State <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=death+tax">death tax</a></span>. New Jersey demands (approximately) $34,000 in tax on a $1.0 million taxable estate; $64,000 in tax on $1.5 million; and nearly $100,000 in tax on $2.0 million. It is easy to see why residents not subject to federal estate tax move to other states with more favorable death tax regimes.  It appears that this group, although in the second tier of wealth, has even more reason to leave the State.

There is also a State Inheritance Tax and an estate pays inheritance tax if that tax is more than the New Jersey Estate Tax. A $1,000,000 estate left to a Class D beneficiary could pay $150,000 (15%).  Clearly collateral relatives are not favored in this scheme.

The deficit in state pension funding suggests that tax cuts will not be forthcoming any time soon. Former state employees are living longer and are thus receiving pension payments over a longer period and State contributions have not kept pace.

CNBC ranks the State as 34<sup>th</sup> best in which to start a business.  I fear for the State’s future.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Estate planning, when not done in careful accordance with tax law, can lead to extremely high costs for high-net-worth individuals. Many of these costs can be easily mitigated or avoided entirely by taking advantage of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/estate-planning-with-a-non-citizen-spouse-2014-02-19" target="_blank">unlimited marital deduction</a></span>, but this does not <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">apply for individuals who are married to non-citizens</a></span>, according to Market Watch.

<a href="estate-planning-non-citizen-spouse" rel="attachment wp-att-4335"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4335" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/estate-planning-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Estate Planning" width="240" height="240" /></a>The current estate tax is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b615d60e-c7c7-4e47-b314-c30b9ca6abec" target="_blank">40 percent of all holdings in excess of $5.34 million</a></span>, according to Lexology. An individual with a net worth of $10.34 million who is married to a U.S. citizen, for example, might choose to avoid this effective tax of $2 million by bequeathing $5.34 million to his or her children and transferring the remaining $5 million to his or her spouse. There is no limit on <a href="/?s=gift+tax">tax-free gifts</a> to spouses who are U.S. citizens, regardless of whether you are a citizen yourself.

However, if your spouse is a non-citizen, your options are more limited, according to MarketWatch. Your spouse can become a citizen by merit of his or her marriage with you, allowing him or her to take advantage of the unlimited marital deduction. He or she can attain complete citizenship even after your death, but no later than the due date for filing the federal estate tax return, which is typically nine months after your death.

For various reasons, your spouse may not want to become a citizen right now - some countries require renouncing citizenship with them before becoming a citizen of the U.S., for example, which can complicate holdings in those countries. If your spouse wishes to defer becoming a citizen for longer than nine months, the money can be put in a qualified domestic trust - also known as a QDOT - and withdrawn after he or she becomes a citizen.

The final option is to gradually transfer your estate to your non-citizen spouse while you are still alive, advises MarketWatch. In accordance with the tax law, you can gift him or her up to $145,000 per year without incurring tax penalties - substantially more than the standard tax-free gift size of $14,000 to other people.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[As the U.S. tax climate - which is already one of the most stringent in the developed world - threatens to grow harsher, the corporate world is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/518021/tough-corporate-tax-outlook-fueling-inversion-deals" target="_blank">seeing an uptick</a> </span>in so-called "inversion" deals, according to Law360. Companies that undergo inversions effectively give up their U.S. citizenship in order to move overseas - typically, into countries with lower corporate tax rates. Experts are predicting that deals structured in this way will continue to increase amid uncertainty in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">future of U.S. tax law</a>.</span>

<a href="u-s-corporate-tax-outlook-fueling-inversion-deals" rel="attachment wp-att-4329"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4329" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/corporate-001-250x300.jpg" alt="corporate" width="225" height="270" /></a>In a recent high-profile inversion deal, Chiquita Brands International Inc. structured its acquisition of Irish rival Fyffes PLC<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/article/118829/Chiquita-says-move-to-Ireland-isnt-about-taxes" target="_blank">as a merger</a>,</span> allowing the company to effectively move to the lower-taxed country, according to Fresh Plaza. Chiquita says that the move won't decrease its U.S. tax liability, but it will keep Fyffes from being considered by the IRS.

The acquisition is being conducted via a Dublin-based holding company, known currently as Twombly One Ltd., which will buy out the shareholders of both companies, according to the news source. Once Twombly One owns both Chiquita and Fyffes, it is expected to change its name to ChiquitaFyffes PLC.

While Chiquita stressed that the move was not intended as a bid to avoid U.S. taxes, the corporate tax rate in Ireland - 12.5 percent - is significantly lower than the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent, according to Fresh Plaza. While the move may not change Chiquita's 2014 tax liability, it may allow the new company with its tax planning in years to come.

"It is greatly improbable that they have chosen Ireland as its domicile because of its superior banana-growing climate," Edward Kleinbard, a University of Southern California law professor and a former chief of staff for Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation told the news source. "There may not be any immediate U.S. tax consequences, that is true, but it positions the combined company to shift future income growth outside the U.S. tax net."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[After announcements from both sides of the political line regarding an overhaul of corporate tax law, the U.S. Senate's tax-writing committee chairman Sen. Ron Wyden has announced that the committee <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/04/us-usa-tax-wyden-idUSBREA2326K20140304" target="_blank">will not be focusing on such a change</a> </span>in the near future, according to Reuters. Wyden said that tax law reform would be nearly impossible in such a busy year, which will conclude with congressional elections in November. These elections will determine whether President Obama finishes the last two years of his presidency with an opposition Congress or a friendly one.

Wyden (3854004534)" width="512" /></a>Instead, as soon as April, the committee will begin working on restoring a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=tax+breaks">package of tax breaks</a></span> that expired at the end of last year, according to the news source. There were approximately 50 tax breaks that expired before the start of 2014, including a number in the education, energy and business sectors. These tax breaks are typically extended year after year, with a few cuts. While Wyden wasn't specific about which cuts might be made, he said that some energy tax extenders should be looked at.

"My hope is that we can get them re-enacted promptly," <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-13/extending-tax-breaks-priority-for-senate-finance-chairman.html" target="_blank">Wyden told Bloomberg Television</a></span>'s "Political Capital with Al Hunt," "Then use them as a bridge to more comprehensive reform."

While Obama supports <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">corporate tax law reform</a></span>, as do some republicans, Wyden told the news source that it would be a challenge to pass major changes. Eventually, he would like to get reform passed and to see individuals' tax payments "get closer to parity between income from investment and income from wages."

According to Reuters, Wyden is a firm opponent of lobbyist intervention in the tax code, saying "the tax code is a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a permitted shareholder of stock in a corporation with a valid S election in effect (“S Corporation”).  IRC §512(e)(1) provides that the earnings attributable to an ESOP’s stock in an S Corporation shall be<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business"> taxable as unrelated trade or business income</a></span>; however, §512(e)(3) further provides that §512(e)(1) shall not apply where an ESOP owns <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all </span></b>of the stock in the S Corporation. The difference between owning some stock and all stock was the difference in <i>Tribune Corporation</i> case of some years ago.

<a href="s-corporation-esops" rel="attachment wp-att-4355"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4355" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/S-Corporation-001-300x250.jpg" alt="S-Corporation" width="240" height="200" /></a>The benefit of an ESOP owning all of the stock of an S corporation is that the earnings are free of tax.

In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Austin</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commissioner</span>, the Tax Court held that all of the shares of an S corporation were held by an ESOP despite the fact that there were shares issued to the principals but those shares were held to be substantially non-vested because they were subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Treas. Reg. §1.1361-1(b)(3) provides that S Corporation stock issued for the performance of services that is substantially non-vested is not counted as outstanding and the holder is not treated as a shareholder.

The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> issue before the Tax Court</a> </span>was whether the restrictions imposed upon the stock constituted a substantial risk of forfeiture. By way of background, property received in exchange for services is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if such person’s rights to the property are conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services. The statute, IRC §83, however, is not detailed so guidance is sought from the regulations under §§1.83-3(c)(2).  The regulation provides that if the property is subject to a restriction that it must be returned if earnings do not increase is a substantial risk of forfeiture. In contrast, discharge for cause or committing a crime is not a substantial risk because it is remote and unlikely to occur.

At issue in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Austin</span> was whether the S Corporation stock issued to the principals was or was not substantially vested. Taxpayer contended the combination of restrictions in the employment agreement and the Restricted Stock Agreement were sufficient to cause the stock to be non-vested.  Although a restriction by itself that an employee may be terminated for refusing to faithfully perform his or her duties of employment may not be a substantial risk of forfeiture, it was coupled with an additional restriction. The added restriction was that termination of employment before four years lapsed would result in employee receiving only one-half of the fair market value. The combination of restrictions was held by the court to cause a substantial risk of forfeiture and the shares were not vested.  Therefore, each individual was not treated as a shareholder. All of the S Corporation’s earnings were reported by and attributable to the ESOP, and none of the earnings were taxable to the two individuals whose shares were subject to the risk of forfeiture.

If you have any questions about S Corporations and ESOPs please contact attorney <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/james-f-mcdonough/">James F. McDonough </a></span>or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/gary-s-young/">Gary S. Young</a></span>

		<content><![CDATA[Invariably, wealth transfer structures encounter changing circumstances as the founding generation grows older and passes away.  Typically, company managers dominate decision-making for a period of years.  Unfortunately, if one of the members of the next generation is designated to take charge to the exclusion of others, the excluded members may resist.  Even more dangerous is management by committee, where individuals with different abilities, goals and personalities mix in a caldron and boil over in conflict.  Alternative dispute resolution methods are touted as a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">means of resolving conflict</a>.</span> The problem is a negotiated settlement may be an<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business-law/">albatross around the neck of the business</a>.</span>  Although the dispute is settled, success may not follow.

<a href="reconciling-divided-loyalties-collision-fiduciary-duties-trustees-company-managers" rel="attachment wp-att-4362"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4362" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Company-Managers-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Company-Managers" width="240" height="240" /></a>Operating agreements and partnership agreements for family structures are drafted for the approval of the patriarch and rarely undergo revision. Control is maintained by personality as well as position.  Successor managers are often adult children of the patriarch and may also be trustees of a family trust that will be divided among the siblings after both parents pass.  Even more complex are the relationships among the duties of a successor who is also a trustee of a GST exempt trust for the grandchildren of the patriarch.  The adult child may be receiving a salary from a business that she is also responsible for monitoring in her capacity as trustee.

A breach of duty may arise when a sibling is a manager of a limited liability company and also a trustee of a family trust. The goals of the business or investment partnership may not fit with the need of a trustee for cash for distributions to beneficiaries of the trust. Salaries, capital expenditures and investment strategies are areas ripe for dispute.  Even more difficult are issues relating to compensation where not all family members are employed by the business.  Disputes arise frequently when unequal numbers of grandchildren from each branch enter the family business and burden it with inflated salaries.

There are differences in state law on the duties owed by one party to another. In Delaware, parties have the freedom to enter into a contract, called an Operating Agreement, and have its terms respected by a court.  In other states, duties and obligations may be imposed that cannot be changed by agreement.  Thus, choice of state law may deprive the patriarch of an opportunity to set forth a standard and procedure to govern the resolution of future disputes.

Although important but seldom discussed, are the responsibilities and burdens imposed by state law upon an adult child who becomes a manager. Delaware law permits the elimination of fiduciary duties in the Operating Agreement. Typically, that same agreement would require that conflicted transactions be fair and reasonable. This means that conflicted transactions must be no less favorable than those terms provided to or by third parties.

Delaware’s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not override express provisions of the contract, but it will inject terms into the agreement if issues are not addressed.  The patriarch should decide if reliance upon an appraisal or fairness opinion is sufficient to defeat claims of a disgruntled family member. Also, should a super majority vote (two-thirds or more) be sufficient to ratify the decision as being fair and preclude a claim.  It may not be possible to prevent a dispute, but it may be possible to establish criteria by which it is decided.]]></content>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/New-York-State-estate-tax.gif" alt="After turning a $10 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is facing re-election this year, but first he is proposing a major update to the New York State estate tax law, according to Investment News. " />A recent change - included within an ambitious budget that includes tax cuts and investments in education and health care - would reduce estate tax liability over the next few years while simultaneously closing an extremely popular loophole.

The Wall Street Journal explained that the first change would be to raise the exemption<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>from $1 million to $5.25 million over the next four years, which would fall into line with the federal exclusion by 2019. Over the same time period, Cuomo's proposal would lower the top <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=new+york+estate+tax">N.Y. state estate tax </a></span>rate from 16 percent to 10 percent. That's the carrot.

The stick, according to Investment News, is that these steps would be paired with proposals to require that the value of lifetime gifts be added back into the estate once the donor is deceased. While individuals with estates worth less than the new exemption will now be free from any estate tax burden under the new tax law, this proposal may cause many<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">high net worth individuals to rethink their estate plans</a>.</span>

"The advice is to keep an eye out for people who might be thinking of gifting," Kate Cassidy, an advanced markets specialist with Barnum Financial Group's wealth strategies division told the news source. "I would put thought into it: Building a trust that can receive the gift. This is a large gift you'd make all at once, an asset that you can give away without feeling the pinch."

Proponents of the bill feel that it will allow the state to continue raising revenue from the estate tax law while allowing individuals who have amassed more than $1 million over a lifetime of hard work to keep their money.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A number of companies have coming under scrutiny in recent months, as the U.S. reconsiders its corporate tax policy. The latest of these companies is the Peoria-based construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc., which is being probed by a U.S. Senate investigative panel to find out whether it avoided taxes by<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-caterpillar-tax-probe-20140321,0,51873.story" target="_blank">improperly moving profits</a></span> overseas, according to Bloomberg. Two people familiar with the matter told the news source that the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing in early April. Rachel Potts, a spokeswoman for Caterpillar, and Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin, both declined to comment.

<a href="caterpillar-faces-tax-probe" rel="attachment wp-att-4384"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4384" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/catepillar-inc-001.jpg" alt="Caterpillar Inc" width="215" height="169" /></a>Caterpillar's overall tax rate has<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a89d3bfa-b10b-11e3-9f6f-00144feab7de.html#axzz2wd0D4fDF" target="_blank">fallen steadily over the last 14 years</a>,</span> as it has moved more of its profits outside the U.S., according to Financial Times. The company was paying a tax rate of 32 percent in 1999, a number that fell to 25.7 percent in 2013. Over the same period of time, Caterpillar's activities outside of the U.S. fell from 26 percent of its profits to 62 percent.

In 2009, Caterpillar Inc. was accused by then tax strategy employee Daniel Schlicksup of using a "Swiss structure" to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=off+shore">offshore profits</a></span> resulting in a $2 billion reduction in the companies tax rate, according to Bloomberg. According to the complaint, the Swiss structure involved "many shell corporations with no business operations," in which management was shifted to offshore companies while in actuality continuing in the U.S. Schlicksup's complaint also alleged that Caterpillar used a "Bermuda structure" to repatriate profits without paying U.S. taxes.

Schlicksup's lawsuit, including the allegation that Caterpillar executives had retaliated against him, was settled in 2012, according to the news source. Caterpillar executives denied the allegations.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In the hit Netflix show, "House of Cards", Kevin Spacey plays silver-tongued, Machiavellian U.S. politician Frank Underwood. In the show's well-received first season, Underwood occupies the seat of whip for the House of Representatives, but on March 21, Spacey was whipping votes all by himself, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/03/22/kevin-spacey-whips-votes-for-maryland-film-tax-credits/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">according to The Washington Post</span>.</a>

<a href="spacey-whips-votes-maryland-tax-credit" rel="attachment wp-att-4474"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4474" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/spacy-300x300.jpg" alt="spacy" width="240" height="240" /></a>"House of Cards" filmed its first two seasons in Maryland, and had planned to begin filming the third this spring, explained the news source. However, the show's makers have announced that filming will be put off until at least June, pending a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">decision regarding the state's film tax credits</a></span>. The filmmakers want <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/film-production-tax-credits-work/">$15 million more to be put aside for the tax credit</a>,</span> adding to the estimated $26.6 million the show has already received. So far, only $4 million have been promised.

According to ABC News, the makers of the show wrote a letter to lawmakers, threatening to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/03/kevin-spacey-visits-maryland-to-promote-house-of-cards-tax-credit/" target="_blank">take their business elsewhere</a> </span>if enough money isn't found. A number of Maryland politicians are understanding of the demands, considering the positive influence the film industry has on the state.

"It is absolutely essential for us to keep [House of Cards] in Maryland." Delegate John Donoghue, D-Hagerstown, said outside the bar awaiting Spacey's arrival, according to the news source. "I know there are people who are criticizing us but it has a huge impact on the economy in Maryland for them to stay here and film in Annapolis and Baltimore. If we lose them that's not good. Our film industry in Maryland for many years has done terrifically well. We've had many motion pictures filmed here."

For his part in the Red Red Wine Bar event on March 21, Spacey had as much real world charm as his character.

"We are enormously honored to be in this state," he told the crowd of state lawmakers, reported the Washington Post. "I can only tell you that every single day I go to work, there's no doubt in my mind that the faces I look at of Marylanders are incredibly happy that we're here."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[One of the hard-fought issues between taxpayers and the <a href="/?s=IRS">Internal Revenue Service (IRS) </a>was whether a trust could qualify for the passive activities exception. Specifically, activities are grouped into one of two categories, either active or passive. The goal of §469 was to prevent losses from a passive activity from offsetting active income. If one can recall the heyday of the tax shelter industry when losses from passive activities offset earned income (e.g., salary) and cause less income tax to be collected.  The 1986 Tax Reform Act contained the passive loss rules §469 that were designed to segregate active and passive income and loss.

<a href="aragona-trust-v-commissioner-taxpayer-victory-3-8-surcharge" rel="attachment wp-att-4480"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4480" alt="aragona-trust-001" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aragona-trust-001-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>The passive loss rules contain an exception under §469(c)(7) whereby a taxpayer who satisfies the material participation test will be able to classify the income or loss as active.  Why is this important?  The Affordable Care Act introduced a 3.8%<a href="/another-perspective-taxation/"> income tax surcharge on passive income</a> that could be avoided if the trust materially participates.  The other alternative is that losses, rather than being trapped, can be used against active income.

How does a trust qualify for the §469(c)(7) exception? The Tax Court held the taxpayer meets the requirement if more than one-half of the services are in real property trades or businesses in which he materially participates.  The Tax Court agreed with the taxpayer and held that the activities of the trustee can be used to measure material participation. This is the pro-taxpayer aspect of the case.  IRS had maintained the legislative history referred only to natural persons and C corporations as qualifying for material participation under this provision.

<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">Trustees and advisors should review their real estate holdings</a> in order to determine if they can avail themselves of the holding.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aragona</span> has some unique facts.  The Trust owns rental real property and entities that hold and develop real estate. The Trust was managed by one independent trustee and the Grantor’s five children. One limited liability company (LLC) wholly owned by the Trust employed  three children and managed trust properties.

Each one of the six trustees was paid a fee by the Trust. In 2005 and 2006, the Trust treated these payments as losses from non-passive activities. The IRS wanted the losses classified as passive activity losses.

The ability of a taxpayer to avoid passive characterization is very  helpful as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aragona</span> is a better reasoned opinion than the <i>Mattie Carter Trust</i> out of a District Court in Texas.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In the midst of a number of more controversial cases, the Supreme Court ruled on March 25 that severance payments are <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/03/25/66461.htm" target="_blank">subject to payroll tax</a>, according to Courthouse News Service. Specialty agricultural retailer Quality Stores brought the challenge as an <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">adversary action in its bankruptcy filin</a>g as a result of the IRS refusing to refund over $1 million in taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Supreme-Court-001.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4489"><img class="alignright wp-image-4489" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Supreme-Court-001.jpg" alt="Supreme-Court" width="240" height="240" /></a>According to the news source, Quality Stores withheld the money when it filed for protection under <a href="/?s=chapter+11">Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law</a>, despite viewing it as Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) pay. The company asked 3,100 former employees to allow it to file tax refund claims on their behalf, of which 1,850 said yes.

Justice Elena Kagan recused in the case, according to Reuters, and the other justices were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/25/us-usa-court-taxes-idUSBREA2O11R20140325" target="_blank">unanimous in overturning</a> the 6th Circuit Court's ruling in Quality Stores' favor. In the oral arguments before the ruling, the IRS and Quality Stores disputed seemingly contradictory language in the tax law. One part of the tax law defines wages as "all remuneration for employment," while another states that supplemental unemployment benefits are exempted from income taxes.

The court found in favor of the IRS in this case, according to the news source.

"A specific exemption under FICA for certain termination-related payments reinforces the conclusion that the payments in question are well within the definition of wages," Justice Antony Kennedy wrote for the court, according to Courthouse News Service. "Section 3121(a)(13)(A) exempts from taxable wages any severance payments made 'because of ... retirement for disability.' That exemption would be unnecessary were severance payments in general not within FICA's definition of 'wages.'"]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has led a well-publicized push to simplify the Empire State's tax code. As of the stroke of midnight on April 1, the estate tax exemption doubled to <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140401/ECONOMY/140339979/new-york-finally-a-great-place-to-die" target="_blank">more than $2 million</a>, according to Crain's New York Business. As per the budget agreement reached over the weekend, the state's tax exemption will rise by more than $1 million every year until April 1, 2017, at which point it will pause at $2.52 million. On Jan. 1, 2019, the exemption will then rise to match and keep in line with the federal exemption, which is currently $5.34 million and indexed to inflation.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/new-york-doubles-estate-tax-exemption/new-york-001-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4495"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4495" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/new-york-001.jpg" alt="new-york-001" width="240" height="171" /></a>The <a href="/?s=new+york">New York estate tax reform</a> will exempt 90 percent of the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">households in the state who would have paid the tax</a> under the previous $1 million exemption. But, this is predicted to cost the state significantly less in tax revenues, as the majority of the revenue comes from the top estates, which are taxed at 16 percent, the news source explained. Estate tax planners have called the move a step in the right direction, but continue to voice reservations.

<a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/commentletter/budget14.pdf" target="_blank">One such problem</a> that planners have with the law is the so-called "tax cliff" that it creates, according to a comment letter written by The New York State Society of CPAs. Those that have just 5 percent more than the 2017 exemption will be subject to a marginal tax rate of almost 164 percent, because the entire estate will be taxed, as opposed to the funds in excess of the exemption. Therefore, an estate 5 percent over the $5.25 million exemption, faces an effective tax of $430,050 on the additional $262,500.

Despite this new quirk in the tax law, New York is now emphatically a better place to die.]]></content>

The Maryland Senate passed a measure March 20 that will gradually raise the state exemption from $1 million to the projected $5.9 million federal exemption by 2019. The current inflation-indexed federal estate tax exemption is $5.34 million.

<a href="new-bill-makes-less-taxing-die-maryland" rel="attachment wp-att-4504"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4504" alt="Maryland" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Maryland-001-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>This move is notable in that Maryland is a staunchly Democratic state, indicating that easing the so-called "pain of death" tax isn't only a Republican issue, according to the news source. Maryland is one of the 19 remaining states, including the District of Columbia, that still imposes an estate tax. In the past four years, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma have repealed their estate taxes, and Tennessee is slated to repeal its estate tax by 2016.

The increase in the<a href="/maryland-legislators-cut-estate-taxes/"> Maryland estate tax </a>exemption will reduce the tax liability on a large number of its citizens, but high net-worth individuals should be aware that a separate inheritance tax may be assessed, depending upon to whom they leave their money, Forbes reported. While immediate family members are exempt from the inheritance tax, a nephew, aunt or friend, for example, would not be.

Opponents of the bill contended that wealthy individuals <a href="http://somd.com/news/headlines/2014/17965.shtml" target="_blank">do not commonly</a> leave the state for <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates" target="_blank">tax issues</a>, according to Southern Maryland Today.

"A lot of people when they get to an older age want warmer weather," Prince George's County Democrat Sen. Paul Pinsky said in the debate, according to the news source. "Many people move south not because of estate tax, but because of warmer weather. No one has shown me, or shown any of us, that people leave because of our estate tax exemption."

Pinsky also pointed to the fact that Maryland has the highest number of millionaires per capita, Southern Maryland Today reported. Baltimore City Democrat Sen. Catherine Pugh, however, called attention to the 2013 and 2014 Forbes articles, titled "Where Not To Die," which both named Maryland.

"We don't want articles written like that," Pugh said.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Family Loans are an integral part of life, as well as estate and gift tax planning.  Until the IRS victory in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dickman</span> in 1980, interest-free loans were a staple of tax planning. Today, however, the rules that apply are designed to force interest income to be reported, even if not paid.  Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) encounter these rules in preparing returns and must comply. Those familiar with the topic know that a complete discussion is beyond the scope of a blog, but here are some common misunderstandings.

<a href="imputed-interest-gifts-family-loans" rel="attachment wp-att-4513"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4513" alt="famly loan" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3297-101413-gs3297-001-300x250.jpg" width="240" height="200" /></a>The first issue is whether the loan is a term loan or a demand loan.  Invariably, family members do not execute notes reciting interest rates, so CPAs are forced to apply the demand loan rules. Each year, the IRS publishes an interest rate in January and again in July with each rate applying for six months. If the loan remains outstanding, the taxpayer may use a blended rate to calculate the interest that must be reported. Where the taxpayer does not keep good records, it is especially difficult to address the issues after the death of the taxpayer and to prepare an inheritance or estate tax return. Was it a gift or are the income tax returns wrong.

What makes matters more difficult is that the borrower, typically a child, sometimes pays irregularly. Fortunately, the rules provide that each payment reduces the balance and a new loan is created on the following day using the “exact” or “approximate” method.  Once again, the process requires record keeping which is beyond the reach of many individuals.

The duration of a term loan causes an appropriate rate of interest to be assigned by IRS. Where taxpayer’s interest rate is below the rate required by IRS, Original Issue Discount (“OID”) must be charged. The lender’s income tax return not only must report income but also must recite five (5) items in a statement attached to the return.  The borrower’s return must contain a similar statement. Despite the fact the rules have been around for years, most taxpayers do not realize that OID applies to cash-basis taxpayers.

Below market term and gift loans require the lender to report the forgone interest as a gift on the last day of the year. Loans with adequate interest do not have to report forgone interest; however, accrued but unpaid interest requires OID reporting.

Sales of property for less than fair market value pose a problem. Is the transaction a gift of the bargain portion or is it a below market loan? When the present value of the payments is less than the face value of the loan, it is OID. This is, perhaps, the most overlooked issue in tax.  The <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">tax preparer’s nightmare</a> is when the value, appraised or not, undervalues the gift. Not only are there estate and gift tax consequences, but also there are income tax.

No where does this area become more obtuse than an interfamily installment sale to a child of property to be used in business.  Many contend that §483(e) applies exclusively and application of §7872 is precluded by §7872(f)(8) and the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frazee</span>  case.   Yet for all the complexity, no one can deny that loaning funds to a child to buy a house or start a business.  Funds loaned today on a ten year loan at 3.3% may transfer substantial wealth over the long term.  Despite the rules, family loans have substantial benefits.]]></content>

Caterpillar held about $17 billion in offshore profits as of the end of 2013, which are shielded from U.S. taxes as long as they aren't repatriated, up from $15 billion a year earlier. The company has allegedly deferred or avoided $2.4 billion of U.S. taxes by utilizing a corporate restructuring to a Swiss subsidiary to shift profits from overseas replacement-part sales.

<a href="tax-avoidance-subcommittee-blasts-caterpillar-inc" rel="attachment wp-att-4519"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4519" alt="Caterpillar" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Family-Loans-001-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a><a href="caterpillar-faces-tax-probe/">Caterpillar</a> responded to the report by saying that it set up a "standard multinational business structure entirely consistent with the letter and spirit of U.S. tax law," according to the news source. It added that it pays an average effective global income-tax rate of 29 percent, six percentage points lower than the U.S. corporate income tax, but three percentage points higher than the average.

Reuven Avi-Yonah, a University of Michigan <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax expert </a>who was scheduled to testify at the hearing, <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1gYszIX" target="_blank">described the arrangement</a> as follows: Caterpillar, Inc. ceded ownership of the used parts to a Swiss partnership named CSARL. When parts were destined for dealers in the U.S., CSARL would give them back to Caterpillar at no profit, which in turn would report the sale to the IRS. Parts destined abroad, however, were booked as CSARL sales and reported to Swiss authorities at a tax rate of 4 percent to 5 percent. The parts were never physically transferred to CSARL, however, but rather sat in the same bins in Caterpillar's Morton, Ill. facilities.

Some senators were not on board with the questioning of Caterpillar's tax strategy, according to the Journal.en. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, R-Kentucky, said at the hearing, "I'd like to take my time to apologize to Caterpillar for holding this hearing. We should be congratulating Caterpillar [for creating U.S. jobs] and perhaps giving them an award. We've got the wrong people on trial here. It's the tax code that should be on trial."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Senate tax committee <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2014/04/04/tax-panel-ok-breaks-for-special-interests.html" target="_blank">approved a package</a> of so-called tax extenders April 3, according to The Columbus Dispatch. The tax extenders are a collection of special-interest tax breaks that regularly expire and are extended, including breaks for wind energy, Hollywood, teachers, college tuition and more. About 50 temporary tax breaks were extended for two years retroactively after many of them expired at the end of last year, totaling approximately $85 billion in breaks.

<a href="corporate-tax-break-back-senate-package" rel="attachment wp-att-4528"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4528" alt="package" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/san-francisco-city-buildings-1013tm-pic-1289-001-225x300.jpg" width="180" height="240" /></a>Among the tax breaks was one used by large multinational companies to <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/03/usa-tax-extenders-idINL1N0MV0VX20140403" target="_blank">avoid U.S. corporate income tax</a> on capital transfers between offshore units, called the look-through rule, Reuters reported. Two days ago, the committee's Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, unveiled legislation to renew the extenders, leaving out the look-through rule. This has been interpreted as a political gesture to show his intention to<a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law"> reduce corporate tax breaks</a>.

Lawmakers were already adding the look-through rule back into the legislation by the time the first meeting was underway, according to the news source.

Wyden has expressed his determination to end the extenders process as a part of a broad tax law overhaul, the Dispatch explained. He recognized, however, that this isn't going to happen in the immediate future.

"Today, we've got to balance short-term needs with long-term goals," Wyden said, according to the news source. Before the meeting, Wyden expressed that he was, "determined this will be the last extenders bill on my watch."

The House Ways and Means Committee, which writes taxes, is set to vote on its own extenders package in the coming week, according to the news source. Tax breaks were also renewed for mortgage-insurance costs, railroad maintenance, bonus depreciation and corporate research and development.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Republicans are known for cutting personal and corporate taxes, but the latest GOP tax proposal does neither, focusing instead on reductions in spending. Rep. Paul Ryan's 2015 budget proposal looks as though it's <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-confident-about-paul-ryans-budget-105412.html">set to pass the House</a> by a narrow margin, according to POLITICO. After weeks of vote whipping, Republicans are saying that they are confident that the proposal will get enough support from their side to pass without the support of the Democrats, who are expected to pan the proposal.

<a href="gop-budget-pass-house"><img class="alignright wp-image-4538 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSE7548_09-22-2012_2105And2more_tonemappedWEB-300x198.jpg" alt="GOP" width="300" height="198" /></a>"I predict a win," House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told POLITICO.

McCarthy told the news source that his only issue in getting support for the bill was three House Republicans from Georgia who are fighting in a Senate primary and won't vote for the bill for fear of giving their opponents political leverage. Privately, Republicans said that the 2015 <a href="white-house-budget-takes-276-billion-multinationals/">budget </a>will probably pass by the slimmest margins in the four years that they have held a majority in the House.

Ryan's plan intends to cut federal spending by $5 trillion over the next ten years, which would close the deficit in that time, POLITICO explained. Much of these savings come in the form of reductions in health care under the<a href="http://scarincilawyer.com/what-do-new-jersey-municipalities-need-to-know-about-the-affordable-care-act/"> Affordable Care Act,</a> known colloquially as Obamacare. The plan also cuts over $700 billion from Medicaid and other health care programs and hundreds of billion from food stamps, education programs and farm programs. Obamacare's benefits would be significantly reduced, but Ryan plans to keep its<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> tax increases and reductions </a>in payments to health care providers.

If the Republican-controlled House were to pass the proposal, it would then <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-usa-fiscal-ryan-idUSBREA2U1K920140331">immediately be voted down</a> in the Senate, according to Reuters. It might, however, serve as political fodder in the November congressional elections. The Republicans view the desire to shrink the $17.5 trillion national debt and reduce government spending as a key means to gain political ground against Democrats.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<img class="alignright wp-image-4547 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DIY-001-300x180.jpg" alt="Do It Yourself" width="300" height="180" />The Internet has made it easier for individuals to produce their own documents. Please note I used the word “produce” and not “prepare” because Do It Yourself (DIY) does not always equate to a good result.

The Florida Supreme Court ruled recently that a 2004 E-Z Legal Form (“Form”), which did not have a residuary clause, did not dispose of the decedent’s property and caused state intestacy law to apply. The decedent’s Form left her property to her sister, then to her brother if the sister predeceased the decedent, which she did. The Will used the phrase “all listed items” creating an ambiguity as to the disposition of non-listed items. After the sister’s death, the decedent signed a handwritten note leaving the decedent’s bank accounts that were not listed items to a niece, the daughter of the brother. The note was held to be invalid because the only witness was the person named to receive the accounts.

The outcome of the case was that the non-listed items, that is the bank accounts, passed by the <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">laws of intestacy</a> to the brother and to the nieces of the deceased sister. The brother lost and his daughter lost due to the ineffectiveness of the Form and handwritten note, respectively.

Many years ago a local CPA asked me to meet with a client of his whose spouse had passed away. Months went by without any contact. Almost one year later, the surviving spouse appeared carrying a federal estate tax return that he prepared. The deceased spouse left an IRA to their son as primary beneficiary and the souse as secondary. The account contained internet stocks that had exploded in value. Instead of the bequest being a token of affection, it cost hundreds of thousands in <a href="/?s=estate+tax">estate tax</a>. The individual made a comment to me that he prepared the return himself and didn’t have to pay me or the CPA to prepare it. When I asked if he considered having the son disclaim part of the account so the value did not exceed the estate’s $600,000 credit. When I explained that my suggestion would have avoided taxes, he became upset. He later called and told me that the disclaimer I described was not in the IRS publication so the plan I proposed must not be legal. I patiently explained to him that the mission of the IRS was to collect taxes and was not to help taxpayers plan to avoid taxes. The man was a veteran and in his 70s, the kind that fought for his country and paid his taxes. He said he felt betrayed by the absence of certain useful information in that publication.

The point of the story is that the Internet is today’s equivalent of that <a href="/?s=IRS">IRS </a>publication: sometimes helpful and perhaps well meaning, but not always complete and able to meet your needs..

		<content><![CDATA[This November, a number of politicians at the head of key congressional committees are set to step down, and that could lead to changes in the debate regarding corporate tax reform, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2014/04/08/new-slant-on-corporate-taxes/">according to The Wall Street Journal.</a></span> There is almost $2 trillion in offshore profits held by U.S. multinationals, approximately $650 billion of which is in cash, per International Strategy &amp; Investment research. The cumulative foreign profits of these companies rose 12 percent in 2013 and have grown at a compound annual rate of 20 percent since 2005.

<a href="debate-change-regarding-corporate-taxes" rel="attachment wp-att-4567"><img class="alignright wp-image-4567 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Corporate-300x300.jpg" alt="Corporate" width="300" height="300" /></a>These companies, which include the likes of Apple, Caterpillar, Cisco and many others, argue that the lower rates that they can see overseas effectively trap their earnings there, according to the news source. They say that the U.S. should follow other industrialized countries and adopt a territorial tax system, which would allow them to pay little to no tax on the foreign profits above what they have already paid in tax-havens abroad. This would encourage them to bring their profits home, they argue. Currently, the U.S. requires companies to pay the difference between foreign taxes and the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent when they repatriate their money, even on goods sold internationally.

Is the higher corporate tax rate in the U.S. hurting the economy? It is difficult to tell,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://247wallst.com/economy/2014/04/09/is-the-corporate-tax-rate-really-hurting-the-economy-at-35/"> according to 24/7 Wall Street</a></span>. Conventional wisdom says that the corporate tax rate is paid for by shareholders, though there is some research that suggests that some of it is paid for by workers and consumers as well, in the form of lower wages and higher priced goods. However, neither of these arguments is airtight - in competitive economies, management often has little control over pricing and wages if it wishes to remain profitable.

This coming November, Rep. Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will not be running again, according to the Journal. In his place is expected to be Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, or Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Sen. Levin, chairman of the Senate subcommittee that called Caterpillar, Apple Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft Corp. to hearings over their tax practices is also retiring. Where the debate will go next depends on the voters.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[On March 31, 2014, New York State enacted legislation that would begin to raise the New York estate tax exclusion over five years to eventually equal the federal figure. The table set out below shows the increases and the effective dates of such increases. Most readers will agree that everything has a price and, as one would expect, the revenue lost from the <a href="/?s=estate+tax">estate tax</a> would be made up from another source.

<img class="alignright wp-image-4556 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/new-york-estate-tax-001-258x300.jpg" alt="new-york-estate-tax-001" width="258" height="300" />The New York State legislation has two additional provisions that are worthy of attention.

Three Year Look Back - New York added a provision that would pull gifts made between April 1, 2014 and 2019 back into the estate tax calculation. The State felt this was necessary to protect the tax base. The logic is sound as taxpayers could make<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/?s=gift+tax">gifts today</a></span> that would not be part of the tax base and gain the benefit of the increased exclusion as well. An individual could make a taxable gross estate of $3,000,000 non-taxable for New York State purposes by simply giving away $1,000,000 today.

The Real Change – New York state expects to collect considerable income tax revenue by taxing certain trusts in a manner that is contrary to IRS federal treatment. Thus, New York will treat the trust as a grantor trust, in contrast to the federal system where the non-grantor trust is a separate taxpayer.   Incomplete Non-Grantor Trusts (INGs) have been targeted and eliminated as a means of avoiding New York State income tax. Considering that the New York State income tax rate is currently 8.82% and the New York City rate is 3.876%, one understands why taxpayers establish INGs to avoid the state income tax. The acronym <em>ING</em> is sometimes preceded by a “D” for Delaware or an “N” for Nevada.

<em>INGs</em> provide a benefit when there is a large capital gain to be realized by an individual in a high tax state, such as New York or New Jersey. <em>INGs</em> are also used when intangible assets, such as stock or membership interests, are to be sold. In such a case, a New York resident forms the <em>ING</em> in another state prior to sale. <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">Taxpayers</a> rely on two things. First, the state of a taxpayer’s residence, such as New York, taxes trusts based on the trustee’s residence rather than that of the grantor or creator. It is easy to understand why Delaware and Nevada, states that do not tax non-resident beneficiaries, are popular places in which to establish <em>INGs</em>. Second, distributions of principal made in years after the sale will be non-taxable distributions.

For those persons active in the foreign tax area, they recognize a principal feature of drop-off trusts in the development of <em>INGs</em>. It will be an interesting spring for advisors to the address impact of the change in law of existing <em>INGs</em> and plan for the future.

		<content><![CDATA[An improving economy and reductions in federal spending led the U.S. to the smallest federal budget deficit for March in the past 14 years,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-10/u-s-posts-smallest-march-federal-budget-deficit-since-2000.html"> according to Bloomberg</a></span>. The federal government spent $36.9 billion more than it took in last month, marking a dramatic decrease year-over-year, the Treasury Department said on April 10. In March 2013, the federal budget deficit was $106.5 billion.

<a href="u-s-posts-smallest-march-deficit-since-2000"><img class="alignright wp-image-4558 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/defecit-300x235.jpg" alt="defecit" width="300" height="235" /></a>"The economy is growing, so the tax receipts are up," Paul Edelstein, director of U.S. financial economics at IHS Global Insight Inc. in Lexington, Mass., told the news source. "We've also cut back significantly on expenditures."

Last week, a report showed that the number of employees on company payrolls passed peak pre-recession levels for the first time in March, which will help to further <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">increase tax receipts</a></span>, according to the news source. Corporate tax receipts may also be boosted by the recent pickup in the rate of growth. The Treasury showed that revenue increased 16 percent year-over-year, to $215.8 billion in March compared to 186 billion in March 2013. The federal government spent $252.7 billion in March, down 13.6 percent from the $292.5 billion spent one year prior.

Corporate tax receipts increased to 117.5 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, a $17 billion increase, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/tax-revenue-soars-decreasing-deficit-us-says.html">according to The New York Times</a></span>. Social Security collections increased as well. Lower military spending, fewer outlays for benefits like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/">unemployment insurance </a></span>and continued payments to the Treasury from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae also helped the government's books.

In total, the deficit is expected to equal 4.1 percent of the GDP in 2014, the news source reported. This is down from the peak of almost 10 percent in 2009 - the height of the recession. Deficits going forward are expected to stay level at two percent to three percent over the next few years before spiking at the end of the decade.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A number of states have been lowering their corporate tax rates in recent years in order to remain competitive for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">businesses and high-net-worth individuals</a></span>. The most recent state to do so is New York, in which, for the first time since 1917, manufacturers will no longer pay the state's corporate income tax, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.newsday.com/business/state-budget-ends-corporate-income-tax-for-manufacturers-1.7577046">according to Newsday</a></span>. Ending this tax may help the Empire State hold on to manufacturers, some of whom are leaving for states like Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, which boast lower tax rates.

<a href="ny-budget-ends-corporate-income-tax-manufacturers" rel="attachment wp-att-4584"><img class="alignright wp-image-4584 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/New-York-001-300x150.png" alt="Income" width="300" height="150" /></a>Before the new budget, manufacturers had been paying 5.9 percent of their earnings in taxes, the news source explained. Other types of corporations, which had been paying a rate of 7.1 percent, will now see their tax liability lowered to 6.5 percent. The budget was approved at 12:01 a.m. April 1, the first day of the new fiscal year.

The new budget takes Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Start-Up NY initiative, which had aimed to create tax-free zones in order to encourage innovation, and applies it throughout the state,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbrown/2014/04/11/new-york-legislators-just-did-the-unthinkable-and-voters-will-love-it/">according to Forbes</a></span>. There has been a lot of talk about New York's high tax burden, with Texas Gov. Rick Perry even going as far as to target New York businesses in an attempt to recruit them for his state, and it looks like this problem is being addressed by Albany.

From 1992 to 2010, the Empire State only experienced a continuous net gain of adjusted gross income from one state - Michigan, Forbes explained. In 2011, Michigan Gov. Snyder eliminated the <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/michigans-financial-standing-may-rest-with-gov-snyder/">Michigan Business Tax i</a>n favor of a flat corporate income tax rate of 6 percent. Many in New York are hoping that the new corporate tax break will help the state to remain competitive as other states continue to lower their tax burdens.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Walgreens, a staple U.S. drugstore, has been headquartered in Illinois for almost a century. The company <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-15/opinion/ct-will-walgreens-move-to-switzerland-edit-0415-jm-20140415_1_tax-failure-tax-rate-tax-code">got its start</a> in downstate Dixon, Ill., before moving its corporate headquarters to Chicago and then eventually to Deerfield, Ill., according to the Chicago Tribune. The company's next corporate move may take it further away - to Bern, Switzerland.

<a href="walgreens-urged-undergo-tax-inversion"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/walgreens1-300x190.png" alt="walgreens" width="300" height="190" /></a>A group of influential shareholders, including Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and hedge funds Jana Partners, Corvex and Och-Ziff, are reportedly <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/55a76778-c294-11e3-9370-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2z3bte3oP">pressuring the company</a> to undergo a so-called "inversion," according to the Financial Times. This move would allow Walgreens to relocate to Switzerland, paying a dramatically<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> lower corporate income tax rate.</a> The corporate income tax in the U.S. is among the highest in the world - a factor that has prompted a number of companies in the public eye to redomicile their headquarters abroad.

Analysts at UBS found that Walgreens' tax rate was anticipated to be 37.5 percent this year, according to the news source. This is considerably higher than the<a href="/?s=tax+rate"> tax rate</a> for Alliance Boots, a formerly UK-based pharmacy chain of which Walgreens recently acquired 45 percent. Boots is anticipated to pay a tax rate of only 20 percent as a result of having made such an inversion a few years ago.

UBS explained in a note last month that Walgreens could increase earnings per share by 75 percent by undergoing an inversion, the news source explained. The finance group noted, however, that "Walgreens' management seems more hesitant to pull the trigger near-term due to perceived political risks."

Many think that Walgreens is right to be concerned about political risk, particularly because of recent attention paid to corporate tax in the U.S. and the face-to-face nature of the company's interactions with the public. Inversions have become very popular in the last two years, FT explained, especially in the pharmaceutical sector.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[When most people are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> planning their estates</a>,</span> they typically focus on tangible and financial assets, like real estate, capital holdings and bank accounts. In the modern age, however, it is also important to consider digital assets. North American respondents to a McAfee survey <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2011/q3/20110927-01.aspx">valued their digital assets</a></span> at an average of $54,722 - a sizeable sum. These assets included downloaded music, email accounts, photos, health records, contacts and creative projects, among others.

<a href="digital-assets-included-estate"><img class="alignright wp-image-4594" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/digital-assets-001-300x180.png" alt="digital assets" width="250" height="150" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/03/20/assets-online-plan-your-estate-for-digital-age/">According to Fox Business</a></span>, it can be extremely difficult to find, and subsequently gain access to, the digital assets of a deceased person. As we conduct more of our business and personal interactions online, it is becoming more important to consider how beneficiaries can gain access to accounts and assets that they hold after death.

In the past, when we did more business on paper, there were clues around the house as to the accounts that a deceased individual held, what that person may have owned and what he or she owed, the news source explained. Now, much of that information is digital, which can be an issue, as much of that digital information can be difficult to access. If a deceased person held a large sum of money in a bank account, for example, but failed to inform his or her beneficiaries, they might never find out about that asset.

One issue that beneficiaries can also face is the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2014/04/17/digital-asset-planning/7846143/">according to USA Today</a></span>. This law prohibits unauthorized computer access, and doesn't technically specify between hackers and heirs. The Uniform Law Commission, a Chicago-based nonprofit that works for uniformity of state laws, is working to address this problem. The Commission is drafting a law for proposal that would give fiduciaries the authority to access, manage, distribute, copy or delete digital assets.

As we hold increasingly more digital assets going forward as a society, the importance of considering digital assets in estate planning is likely to only become more pressing.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Despite the affinity that many consumers feel for large <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/will-it-soon-be-easier-for-new-york-and-new-jersey-start-ups-to-go-public/">tech startups</a></span> like Google, Apple and Amazon, a number of these companies have a habit of paying low tax rates both domestically and internationally. Google is only the latest to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/04/28/great-google-y-moogly-internet-giant-slapped-with-huge-tax-bill/">hit by a large tax bill</a></span> in Europe, following a raid of the company's Paris office by French revenue officers in 2011, according to Forbes. Last week, Google disclosed the existence of the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates"> tax assessment</a>,</span> which is reportedly massive, but did not include a Euro figure.

<a href="google-hit-large-international-tax-bill"><img class="alignright wp-image-4602 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tax-Bill-001-300x300.png" alt="Tax-Bill-001" width="300" height="300" /></a>In documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2014, Google noted that it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000128877614000040/goog10-qq12014.htm">anticipated such an assessment</a></span>, writing that it believed that adequate provision had been made, and that it was "more likely than not" that its tax position would be sustained, but that it was possible that adjustments to its tax position could occur as a result of any resolution with French authorities.

While no one in the media knows precisely how much Google might be charged, sources in France told LePoint.fr that the figure was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/google-a-recu-une-notification-de-redressement-fiscal-en-france-25-04-2014-1816139_23.php">between 500 million Euros and 1 billion Euros</a></span> ($693 million and $1.3 billion). Google pays France a very small percentage of taxes for its operations there by routing almost all of its revenue through the Netherlands, reporting it in Ireland and sending it on to Bermuda, where subsidiary Google Ireland Holdings is located.

According to estimates by various industry analysts cited by the news source, Google made a France turnover of between 1.25 billion Euros and 1.4 billion Euros in 2011, mainly from its advertising business. In 2012, Google's turnover in the country was reported at 192.9 million Euros with a net profit of 8.3 million Euros. The company tated that the income taxes paid for 2012 amounted to 6.5 million Euros.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The April 24 deadline is approaching for Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback to make a decision regarding a bill to increase funding for state public schools, according to the Associated Press. Legislators finished working on the bill April 6, before taking a recess until late in the month. Among other measures, the bill would end teacher tenure, increase spending by $129 million, fund separate<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/ncaa-facing-lawsuit-value-scholarships/">programs at state colleges</a></span> and universities and make other changes in education policy. Coming in response to a Kansas Supreme Court ruling that the disparity in funding between public schools in rich and poor school districts was unconstitutional, the bill has garnered support and opposition from various interest groups.

<a href="10-million-tax-credit-proposed-kansas-scholarships" rel="attachment wp-att-4608"><img class="alignright wp-image-4608 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kansas-tax-credit-001-300x300.png" alt="kansas-tax-credit-001" width="300" height="300" /></a>Mark Tallman, lobbyist for the Kansas Association of School Boards, told the news source that the bill appears to satisfy the ruling, and that he doesn't think legislators will have to do more work on funding this session.

"I would tend to think we are out of it. I think it is pretty clear that they satisfied the court order and did what had to be done," Tallman said.

One of the more controversial measures in the bill provides <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2014/04/19/4970611/kansas-school-finance-bill-would.html">$10 million in business tax credits</a> </span>for donating money to scholarships that send the least affluent students to private schools, The Kansas City Star reported. This proposal takes only a small portion of the state's $14 billion budget, but served to draw out old arguments as to whether public money should fund private education. Similar legislation has failed in the state in recent years, but conservatives managed to attach it to the school finance bill, which lawmakers were under pressure to pass.

Critics of the bill argue that it diverts funds to private schools that otherwise could have been used to increase the quality of public education, according to the news source. Republican state Rep. Kasha Kelley, chair of the House Education Committee, supports the bill, saying that critics are focusing on helping failing public schools, rather than on the education of individual children.

"Is it more important for a failing school to lose a few thousand dollars than for a student to gain an education?" Kelley asked.

The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">tax breaks are limited to corporations</a></span>, which can write off up to 70 percent of donations made to scholarship-granting organizations, the news source explained.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A number of people make the assumption that they do not need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="4-steps-successful-estate-planning/">worry about estate planning</a></span>, particularly if their estate will be under $5 million, the federal exemption. However, while an estate below this level will not necessarily incur any federal taxes, there are a number of other <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">benefits to ensuring that your affairs are in order</a>.</span>

<strong><a href="estate-planning-essentials" rel="attachment wp-att-4616"><img class="alignright wp-image-4616 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/estate-planning-001-300x200.png" alt="estate-planning-001" width="300" height="200" /></a>Will</strong>
Even if you aren't worried about how your estate will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/focus-on-death-taxes-continues-as-indiana-drops-law/">taxed upon your death</a></span>, you may still want to put your wishes in writing, detailing to whom your possessions will pass, rather than leave it up to the courts. In particular, a simple will is important if you have multiple children. A death in the family is invariably a stressful time, and a written will can go a long way toward avoiding arguments between family.

<strong>Living will</strong>
There are a number of adults who write out a will, but fail to write a living will, which contains a set of instructions to your physician in the event that you are alive but unable to give these instructions yourself. A living will specifies whether you want to receive certain life-sustaining procedures if you are in a persistent vegetative state or have been diagnosed with a terminal illness.

<strong>Medical power of attorney</strong>
Similar to a living will, medical power of attorney specifies who may make<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/recent-nj-employment-decision-highlights-common-fmla-pitfalls/"> medical decisions</a> </span>for you if you are unable to make them yourself. This document may also be used to specify who will serve as your guardian if you are mentally incapacitated.

<strong>Financial power of attorney</strong>
This document designates a person who will manage the affairs of your estate and make financial decisions on your behalf if you are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/always-work/"> unable to do so yourself.</a></span> This person may manage assets titled in your name, including retirement plans

Many of these documents can specify a spouse, but it is important to name a backup as well, in the event that you are both incapacitated or otherwise unable to make important decisions. Through careful decision making with a financial planner, you can help your family to avoid significant difficulties down the road.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Congress has allowed a number of tax credits to expire before renewing them every two years, in a process known as the "tax extenders." Some of these tax breaks have been renewed regularly for over 30 years. After some wrangling in the House, the Ways and Means Committee voted to make <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/04/29/business-tax-extenders-advance-in-house/">six expired tax breaks permanent</a></span> April 29, according to Market Watch. This move would add $310 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years if approved by the Senate, though analysts explained that this is unlikely to happen before the November elections.

<a href="business-tax-extenders-may-made-permanent"><img class="alignright wp-image-4621 size-medium" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/denver-buildings-1013tm-pic-1255-001-225x300.jpg" alt="tax extenders" width="225" height="300" /></a>In an interesting role-reversal, Democrats are arguing that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-29/business-tax-breaks-of-310-billion-spark-u-s-squabble.html">this move is fiscally irresponsible</a></span>, as it is not offset by spending cuts or tax increases, Bloomberg explained. The left also feels that it is unfair that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">businesses be given tax benefits </a></span>that aren't offset when Republicans have maintained that extending unemployment benefits must be covered.

"To say that Republican action today is hypocritical is a serious understatement," said Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, according to the news source.

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Cam, R-Mich., explained that they started with bills that have had bipartisan sponsors in the past, but he hopes to consider other expired provisions later this year, according to Bloomberg. He declined to say which he wants to make permanent, but the largest are those for<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/funding-your-new-york-or-new-jersey-business-what-do-venture-capitalist-firms-look-for/">bonus depreciation for capital expenses </a></span>and the right to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/new-jersey-sales-tax-revenue-losses-fall-between-64-94-million-due-to-gift-card-law/">deduct state sales taxes</a></span>. Camp plans to retire from Congress when his term ends.

Among the bills that the panel voted to make permanent were the research credit, a rule that allows small businesses to write off capital expenses, the active financing exception, and the look-through rule, the news source reported.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In the wake of a spate of corporate inversions over the last two years, regulators are considering ways to curb the use of this tax strategy, under which <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/walgreens-urged-undergo-tax-inversion/">corporations move overseas</a></span> to enjoy lower income tax rates. On April 30, a U.S. Treasury official told Reuters that the Obama administration is focused on ways to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/30/us-usa-tax-treasury-crackdown-idUSBREA3T0Q420140430">curb tax-motivated inversions</a>.

<a href="irs-chief-u-s-cant-end-corporate-inversions" rel="attachment wp-att-4633"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Corporate-Inversion-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Corporate-Inversion-001" width="300" height="300" /></a>"Cracking down on companies that reincorporate overseas to reduce their U.S. taxes is a priority for the administration," the official told the news source in an emailed statement. "Inversion transactions illustrate the need for comprehensive business tax reform that would lower corporate tax rates and limit the ability of multinationals to shift income outside the U.S."

This focus comes on the heels of two companies' announcements that they were pursuing inversions with overseas rivals, including Pfizer and Omnicom Group Inc., the largest U.S. advertising company, Reuters explained. The IRS issued a notice April 25 limiting shareholders' tax free treatment in these deals.

Despite this focus, IRS commissioner John Koskinen announced April 30 that the government <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-30/treasury-said-to-favor-crackdown-on-tax-lowering-moves.html">probably can't take regulatory action</a> to stop companies from undergoing inversions, according to Bloomberg.

"We've done, I think, probably all we can within the statute," Koskinen, 74, told reporters in Washington, the news source reported. "We try to make sure people are within the bounds, but if they're within the bounds, if they play according to the rules, then they have a right to do that."

Koskinen's announcement demonstrates the limits of the Obama administration's ability to effect tax reform without Congress, which remains deadlocked on tax issues, Bloomberg explained. In response to the recent string of inversions, U.S. lawmakers have spoken about the importance of <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">making broad changes to the tax code</a>, but these are likely to be months or years away from reality.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In the 1990s, an Orange County California minister and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) battled over the amount of his parsonage or housing allowance. The <a href="irs-affirms-rule-on-reimbursements-and-wages/">IRS claimed that the allowance</a>, which is tax-free to the minister, was overstated and that some portion of the allowance should have been reported as income. The case proceeded to court and was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. There, the Court appointed a law professor to write a brief on whether the parsonage allowance was constitutional. Congress took immediate action passing a law granting the exemption but limiting the parsonage allowance to the fair market value of the residence. This statute was a concession to clergy and IRS. The Court dismissed the case because there was no longer an issue to decide although the law professor believed the issue should be briefed, debated and ruled upon.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/allowance-300x300.jpg" alt="allowance" width="300" height="300" />In 2013, this very same issue appeared in two cases. In <em>Freedom From Religious Foundation v. Lew</em>, a Federal District in Wisconsin held that the parsonage allowance was unconstitutional and that the allowance was an endorsement of religion. That case is on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago and enforcement of the decision was stayed. The same issue was litigated in <em>American Atheists v. Schulman</em>, where a Federal District in Kentucky decision is pending. The Kentucky case would also be appealed to the Seventh Circuit.

The impact of a decision adverse to the parsonage allowance may not be limited to housing for ministers. One argument made by atheists is that because churches pay nothing, citizens pay more and that this is unfair. They claim governments could collect 71 billion in tax revenue if the allowance was halted. They also raise an argument that atheist organizations are unable to compete with churches because churches are not subject to the same qualification process. Finally, there is a challenge to the extension of favorable treatment to churches, clergy, religious organizations and non-church organizations that advance religion. They <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">argue equal protection and the establishment clauses claiming that the favorable treatment </a>is without secular purpose and rational explanation in law or fact.

Striking down the parsonage allowance would have a dramatic impact upon real estate property taxation. If other favorable treatment was revoked, the tax-exempt area and religious areas would be dramatically impacted. There has always been tension between church and state throughout history. Once again, it appears, albeit in a slightly different form.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Missouri House of Representatives has sent Gov. Jay Nixon another tax-cut bill, according to the Joplin Globe. This one is worth $620 million, and if enacted, would phase in a cut on income taxes for individuals in the top bracket by 0.5 percent and a deduction of 25 percent for business income on personal tax returns over the next three years.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/missouri-300x300.jpg" alt="missouri" width="300" height="300" />Nixon, indicating that he would likely veto the bill on April 22, pointed out a part of the bill that he claimed would <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">eliminate taxes on business income</a> above $9,000, the Globe reported.

"Once this legislation is fully phased in, the top bracket 'shall be eliminated,'" Nixon said, referring to the provision in the bill. "With the simple stroke of my pen, this bill would separate Missouri from every state in our nation as  the only state to not be able to meet the basic demands."

State republicans argue that the cut will <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/">help owners to expand their businesses</a>, pointing to analysis that former Missouri Chief Justice William Ray Price provided to lawmakers, according to the news source. Price sided with republicans against the governor.

"I believe the governor is living in a fantasy world," said Rep. Charlie Davis, R-Webb City. "I believe the accusations he is making are totally false. This provides some well-deserved tax relief for all Missourians and all Missouri businesses."

Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the not-for-profit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the business income deduction would <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/business-tax-break-has-wide-reach/article_f97cbd94-c983-11e3-80bc-10604b9f6eda.html">create a windfall</a> for some very wealthy people, but provided no assurances that those people would use the money to expand their businesses, the Associated Press reported. Brad Jones, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, on the other hand, feels that the bill would make a big difference to <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=small+business">small business owners</a>.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[U.S.-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer has <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/pfizer-proposes-a-marriage-and-a-move-to-britain-easing-taxes/?ref=business">offered to buy</a> British competitor AstraZeneca for $99 billion, according to The New York Times. In buying the company and moving its headquarters to Britain, Pfizer could avoid U.S. <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">corporate tax liability on its income </a>outside of the the country. Currently, the company pays an effective tax rate of approximately 27 percent - much higher than the British corporate income tax rate of 21 percent.

<a href="possible-pfizer-inversion-raises-questions-among-lawmakers" rel="attachment wp-att-4649"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fizer.jpg" alt="fizer" width="300" height="300" /></a>There are at least 50 American companies that have undergone the <a href="/walgreens-urged-undergo-tax-inversion/">controversial inversion proces</a>s, in which a U.S. company merges with a smaller foreign company in order to enjoy lower tax rates, almost half of which have occurred in the last two years, according to the news source. If successful, however, Pfizer would be the largest and best-known company to do so.

"Pfizer is the Coca-Cola of health care. It's as American as apple pie," Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with the ISI Group, told the news source. "If there is a deal that is going to start a real dialogue in Washington, it might be a company like this."

Such a move would result in the loss of<a href="/irs-chief-u-s-cant-end-corporate-inversions/"> tax income from the company for the U.S. government</a>, which <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/28/us-usa-tax-pfizer-analysis-idUSBREA3R1FL20140428">amounted to about $2.87 billion</a> last year, Reuters reported. This has sparked serious concern from American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

"This further demonstrates the urgency for tax reform," a spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. Senate Finance Committee, told the news source. "Now is the time to undertake comprehensive reform to ensure our country stays competitive on a global stage and continues to be the best place for corporate investment."

The Obama administration included a proposal in its 2015 budget to more seriously regulate deals like the one that Pfizer is attempting, according to Reuters. With Congress deadlocked on tax issues, however, the proposal is unlikely to gain any real ground.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[One of the strongest cases for the legalization of marijuana in Colorado was the untapped business tax revenue that might be had by states that allowed the drug to be sold. However, officials in the state are now <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-05-01/colorado-marijuana-revenue-lags-forecasts-as-licensing-is-slow">scaling back first-year estimates</a> for total <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">sales and business tax revenue</a> from the $1 billion in sales for the coming fiscal year predicted earlier this year, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. During January and February, the first two months that recreational marijuana could be sold in Colorado, the state collected roughly $4.2 million in sales and excise taxes - less than half of the range of $5.5 million to $8.9 million that was estimated by state legislators in 2013.

<a href="marijuana-tax-revenue-lower-forecast-far" rel="attachment wp-att-4663"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tax-revenue1-300x300.png" alt="tax-revenue" width="300" height="300" /></a>"I don't think it's the savior for state budgets," Phyllis Resnick, lead economist at the Denver-based Colorado Futures Center of Colorado State University, told the news source. "It brings in additional revenue, but it also brings in additional costs for administration of the system and regulation and monitoring. It's not free money."

State officials are suggesting that the low sales levels are due to an unexpectedly slow licensing and approval process in Colorado for vendors to sell marijuana, Businessweek explained. Uncertainty caused by <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/will-new-jersey-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-finally-get-off-the-ground/">marijuana's ongoing illegal status </a>at the federal level may also have led to a shortage of supply.

It is possible that sales will pick up in coming months as more shops get licensed to sell marijuana and supply increases. In April, legislators expected to bring in <a href="http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=OBR&amp;date=20140411&amp;id=17519827">approximately $134 million</a> in taxes from the marijuana industry, Reuters reported. Around 30 percent of this sum is earmarked for school districts, with the rest going to treatment, school construction and deterring young people from using the drug. New revenues, however, will only make up about 1.4 percent of the state's available general fund.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The new laws for the estate tax in New York are going to benefit a lot of state citizens in the upper middle class, many of whom have worked over the course of a lifetime to accumulate their wealth.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/estate-tax-ny-300x300.png" alt="estate-tax-ny" width="300" height="300" />Not everyone will benefit from the laws, however, as the financial "cliff" included in the language of the new law <a href="http://www.newsday.com/business/estate-tax-changes-give-some-reason-to-leave-long-island-1.7903142">may raise the marginal tax rate</a> for some individuals, according to Newsday. On April 1, the state's estate tax exemption rose to over $2 million, more than doubling the previous exemption of $1 million. Further, the exclusion will continue to rise by $1,062,500 every April 1 until 2017.

By 2017, the New York state estate tax exemption will match the federal estate tax exclusion, which currently sits at $5.34 million, the news source explained. At this point, the state's exemption will be indexed for inflation like the federal exemption.

This new law means that the majority of <a href="/new-york-residency-rule-part-one/">New York residents</a> will be able to pass on their<a href="new-york-plans-changes-estate-taxes/"> estates tax-free</a>. Descendants of those that are above the exemption, however, may now <a href="http://www.northshoreoflongisland.com/Articles-Arts-and-Lifestyles-i-2014-05-01-99267.112114-sub-Changes-in-New-Yorks-estate-tax-law.html">face a larger tax bill</a> than they otherwise would have, The Times Beacon Record explained. If the estate is valued between 100 percent and 105 percent of the exclusion amount, the additional sum will be taxed.

This means that an estate of $2,165,625 would only be taxed on the amount in excess of the $2,062,500 exemption this year - $103,125. However, an estate valued at only $1 more would be subject to tax on the entire sum of the estate. Further, the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">new estate tax law </a>adds a limited three-year look back period for gifts made between April 1, 2014 and Jan. 1, 2019, during which time the value of any taxable gift is added back into the estate.

One of the reasons for the new estate tax law in New York was to make the state more attractive to wealthy seniors, according to Newsday. The wealthiest among them, however, may find better states in which to pass on their estates.]]></content>

Chairman of the tax-writing Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, noted that he views this trend as a symptom of the broken tax code and is currently "looking at the issue," said a spokeswoman May 8. She added that the senator would soon have details.

<a title="By GearedBull at en.wikipedia [Public domain], from Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AAerial_view_of_the_Capitol_Hill.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Aerial_view_of_the_Capitol_Hill.jpg" alt="Aerial view of the Capitol Hill" width="512" /></a>Meanwhile, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, also said that he would soon introduce legislation to tighten restrictions on companies attempting a corporate inversion, the news source reported. Levin is known to be hard on corporate tax evasion, and has already introduced similar legislation that stipulates that publicly traded companies with assets of $50 million or more that are managed and controlled in the U.S. be treated as U.S. companies for tax purposes.

"I've long been concerned about inversions – <a href="/states-pursue-offshore-tax-free-income/">companies moving offshore</a> on paper, for tax purposes, while the management and operations remain in the United States," the senator <a href="http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/levin-statement-on-legislation-to-close-corporate-inversion-tax-loophole">said in a statement</a>. "It's become increasingly clear that a loophole in our tax laws allowing these inversions threatens to devastate federal tax receipts. We have to close that loophole. I am talking to my colleagues about legislation to close the loophole, which I intend to introduce soon. <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/will-there-be-a-new-loophole-for-insider-trading/">Companies that exploit this loophole</a> benefit from the protections and services the federal government provides, including patent protection, research and <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">development tax credits</a>, national security and more; they shouldn't be allowed to shift their tax burden onto others."

Considering the disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on how the U.S. tax code should be altered, it is unlikely that either bill will make any headway in the near future, the Journal reported.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Despite fierce opposition, House Republicans brought 62 Democrats over to their side to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/house-gop-splits-democrats-business-tax-cut">pass a bill</a> that would make permanent R&amp;D tax cut, according to MSNBC. The legislation passed in a 274-131 vote on the morning of May 9, amid significant lobbying and a threat from the White House to veto the bill.

<a href="house-gop-passes-permanent-rd-tax-cut" rel="attachment wp-att-4694"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/republican-scientist-0011-300x300.png" alt="republican-scientist-001" width="300" height="300" /></a>The bill has been called a policy 'no brainer' because both sides agree on the need for a permanent incentive for American companies to conduct R&amp;D, the news source explained. Republicans and Democrats disagree on how the cut should be implemented, and this disagreement has put both sides in an interesting position.

Democrats argue that the Republicans, who have spent a lot of time in recent years campaigning against any spending that isn't paid for by a reduction somewhere else, do not have the same reservations when it comes to corporate tax breaks.

"Both parties, as the Chairman has indicated, have repeatedly supported temporary extensions, but neither have had the audacity to come to this floor and say 'we're going to borrow enough to make it permanent, without closing a single loophole,'" Rep. Lloyd Doggett said on the House floor. "This bill represents only the first of many installments of hundreds of billions of dollars that the Republicans plan to finance with more debt, borrowing from the Chinese, or whoever will lend it to us."

The research credit was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-09/corporate-research-tax-credit-revived-in-u-s-house-vote.html">enacted first in 1981</a>, according to Bloomberg. During that time, it has existed in a perpetual state of lapse and renewal, as have a number of other<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> tax breaks</a>. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle argue that the uncertainty created by this cycle has prevented companies from relying on it, damaging its effectiveness.d]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The recent spate of corporate inversions, in which a U.S. business merges with a smaller foreign company in order to re-domesticate and thereby enjoy a more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">favorable tax environment</a></span>, has much of Washington talking.

<a href="levin-bill-limiting-corporate-inversions-later-week" rel="attachment wp-att-4689"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/coporate-inversion-300x225.jpg" alt="coporate inversion" width="300" height="225" /></a>Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said May 14 that he will introduce legislation later this week that would <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-14/bill-limiting-inversions-coming-this-week-levin-says.html">limit the ability</a> of U.S. companies to conduct such a maneuver, according to Bloomberg. His bill would alter the rule that sets the minimum requirement for foreign ownership.

At this time, the foreign company only needs to hold a 20 percent stake in the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business">new business</a> that is created, the news source explained. This is favorable to some large U.S. businesses that want to move abroad by purchasing a smaller company but do not want to give up a controlling share in their business. President Barack Obama has proposed raising that minimum to 50 percent.

"If you are serious about stopping people from changing their address to avoid paying taxes, you've got to close that loophole," said Levin, according to Bloomberg.

The Senate's chief tax writer, Ron Wyden, would like to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/13/news/economy/us-corporations-taxes/">enact the same provision</a> and date it back to May 8, 2014, according to CNN Money. This rule would likely make two mergers that are right now underway significantly less attractive to the larger U.S. based companies that are pushing for them. Currently <a href="/possible-pfizer-inversion-raises-questions-among-lawmakers/">Pfizer, a large U.S. pharmaceutical compan</a>y, is attempting to merge with AstraZeneca, and Valeant is attempting to merge with Allergan.

"There is no policy reason to permit a domestic entity to engage in an inversion transaction when its owners retain a controlling interest in the resulting entity, [and] only minimal operational changes are expected," the Treasury Department wrote, explaining Obama's proposal.

Politicians on both sides of the issue would like to see an end to these inversions, but they largely disagree on how they should be stopped. This deadlock may make it difficult to enact any meaningful law.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The state of the U.S.'s infrastructure since the recession hit in 2008 has been steadily decaying. In a May 14 speech at the foot of the Tappan Zee Bridge, President Barack Obama called for congress to pass <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/at-tappan-zee-bridge-president-obama-calls-for-billions-in-transportation-funding-1.8019149">a $302 billion transportation bill</a></span>, according to Newsday. The president argued that the bill would support hundreds of thousands of jobs and repair the nation's roads and bridges.

<a title="By Shadowlink1014 (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AUs127_east_lansing.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Us127_east_lansing.jpg/512px-Us127_east_lansing.jpg" alt="Us127 east lansing" width="512" /></a>"Building a world class transportation system is one of the reasons America became an economic superpower in the first place," the president said.

In his speech, Obama pressed House Republicans to support the four-year transportation package, who have recently called for a $723 million cut to the Department of Transportation and a $500 million reduction to the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, according to the news source.

The federal highway program <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/economy-policy/2014/05/14/senator-mike-lee-gas-tax-needs-to-end/">relies on a tax</a> of 18.4 cents on every gallon of gas that is sold, bringing in $37.4 billion in 2013, according to Fox Business. However, the highway fund is set to run out by this August.

In a May 14 interview, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, explained to the news source that the amount of money coming in isn't the problem, it is where that money is going. For this reason, he is proposing a bill that would bring the federal gas tax down to 3.7 cents per gallon over the next five years.

In response to Lee's bill, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, told the news source, "We can't afford that in our fragile economic recovery. It's time to look for serious solutions to fund our transportation infrastructure, not introduce bills that would undercut the federal/state partnership and make the problem worse, not better."

Neither plan is likely to make it through Congress before the elections in November.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Far too many married couples fail to make an estate plan because they imagine that the surviving spouse can deal with passing on their shared possessions.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wedding-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Married Couples" />In reality, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/estate-planning-essentials/">proper estate planning</a></span> should begin long before either spouse passes away, if you hope to minimize your tax liability and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=estate+planning">accomplish your financial and non-financial goals</a></span>. We've included the most common reasons that married couples create an estate plan.

<b>Minimizing tax liability</b>
If your net worth is higher than the estate tax exemption for the U.S. or for your state, it is important to think about minimizing your tax liability. Often, married couples are able to pay little-to-no taxes on their<a href="/estate-planning-non-citizen-spouse/"> estates with proper planning</a>, which maximizes the amount of assets that can be passed on to loved ones.

<strong>Providing for children</strong>
If you have children who are too young to take care of themselves, it is crucial that you and your spouse discuss what should happen to them in the event that both of you meet an untimely end. Part of making an estate plan is putting in writing who will ensure that your children and other dependents are provided for.

<strong>Privacy</strong>
With no estate plan, the court will appoint an administrator to oversee your estate. This administrator is generally required to post bond and ask permission of the court in order to act on behalf of the estate. This means that anything that you wished to keep private may end up before a court in the event that you die without a will.

Many married couples assume that an estate plan isn't relevant to them, or that a written will is enough. Shifting laws, assets and family relationships, however, can mean that it is difficult for an amateur to write a will in such a way that the writer's wishes will be honored. <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">Talking to an estate planner</a> is the best way to ensure that everything will continue running smoothly after you're gone.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/?s=Tax+inversions">Tax inversions</a></span> have been covered heavily in financial media in recent months, causing a significant stir of public opinion regarding corporate tax rates and some discussion of government action.

<a href="pfizer-astrazeneca-deal-may-be-dead-in-the-water" rel="attachment wp-att-4707"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fish-001-300x300.jpg" alt="fish-001" width="300" height="300" /></a>One of the most significant inversions to be considered is the one between Pfizer, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27466278">second largest global pharmaceutical company</a>, and AstraZeneca, the eighth, according to the BBC. A merger between the two companies would serve to significantly reduce Pfizer's tax liabilities by allowing it to redomicile in Europe, and cause the new company to be the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. Pfizer's 2013 revenue came in at $52 billion, AstraZeneca's was $26 billion and Johnson &amp; Johnson led the world's drug companies at $71 billion.

The possible merger between these two companies led to calls for action on the corporate tax rate from both sides of the U.S. political aisle. Politicians are split, however, as to whether <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">litigation should limit inversions or lower the corporate income tax rate</a>.

The public may not have to worry about this specific merger going through, however, as the smaller company has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/astrazeneca-board-reject-pfizer-takeover-bid">rejected Pfizer's final offer</a> of £69 billion, according to The Guardian. Leif Johansson, chairman for AstraZeneca, said that Pfizer's offer of £55-a-share fell short of the price that the U.S. company was told was necessary.

Pfizer said May 16 that it would pay £53.50 per share, an offer that AstraZeneca rejected, the news source reported. The latter company said that weekend that the price would need to be at least 10 percent higher, leading to a valuation of £74 billion. Pfizer raised its offer to £55 per share, and raised the cash portion of its bid to 45 percent from a previous 33 percent. The rest of the offer is payable in Pfizer shares.

While inversions remain problematic in the world of U.S. corporate tax law, it seems that this particular merger is unlikely to happen. Pfizer has already said that it will not be pursuing a hostile takeover.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A California measure that would have tied the state tax rate on publicly traded companies to the ratio between the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/bill-sought-tie-corporate-tax-rate-ceo-pay-23906961">CEO's salary and that of the median worker stalled in the state's Senat</a>e</span>, according to the Associated Press.

<a href="california-ceo-tax-bill-stalls-state-senate" rel="attachment wp-att-4713"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/California-CEO-300x300.png" alt="California-CEO" width="300" height="300" /></a>The measure would have decreased the tax rate in the state - currently 8.84 percent of net income for businesses and 10.84 percent for banks - to 7 percent for any company whose CEO is paid less than 25 times the median salary of a worker in that company, the news source explained. Companies that pay their chief executive more than that would see an increasing tax rate on a sliding scale, passing the current tax rate when the CEO's pay exceeds 100 times the median pay. The top tax rate would come to 13 percent for companies in which the CEO is paid more than 400 times the median salary of its employees.

"This is not to vilify those individuals," said Sen. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord, before the vote. "They work hard. They are creative. But from a historical standpoint, this is not a sustainable model for us to maintain. Income inequality is a huge threat to California's economic growth and stability."

DeSaulnier noted the difference between this ratio today and 30 years ago, citing two CEOs of Disney, according to the Associated Press. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner received a salary of $750,000 in 1984, a figure that was approximately 37.5 times the salary of the "typical worker." By contrast, Robert Iger, the current CEO of Disney, receives a salary of $34.3 million, approximately 974 times the median pay of a Disney employee.

Katie Orr, the state government reporter for Capital Public Radio, reported that DeSaulnier was <a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2014/05/28/ceo-tax-bill-stalls-in-california-senate/">not able to get the votes needed</a> to pass the bill. Numerous business groups opposed the bill on the grounds that it would drive business away from the state and dramatically increase corporate taxes, and several in DeSaulnier's own party voted against the bill.

Sen. Steve Knight, R-Palmdale, said that the bill was "un-American," and that governments should not tell companies what to do, according to the Associated Press.

These organizations reported almost $2 trillion in profits held offshore, with the 30 largest accounting for 62 percent, or $1.2 trillion.

<a href="offshore-tax-havens-used-70-percent-fortune-500-companies" rel="attachment wp-att-4720"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Offshore-Tax-Haven-300x199.jpg" alt="Offshore Tax Haven" width="300" height="199" /></a>"Our tax code is broken, and it's hurting the public," said Dan Smith, Tax and Budget advocate for the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and a co-author of the report. "We've made it too easy for American multinationals to dodge taxes by setting up shell companies in tax havens. We simply shouldn't allow companies that use American roads, and benefit from America's education system and large consumer market, to take a free ride at the expense of the rest of us."

The U.S. has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/05/usa-tax-avoidance-idUSL1N0OM0VN20140605">not made significant changes</a> to its tax code since 1986, according to Reuters. As a result, there are a number of loopholes present that can be used by individuals, families and corporations. Large businesses regularly defend their tax practices as legal and in the best interest of shareholders. However, recent financial troubles experienced by major western governments and increasingly aggressive tax-minimization strategies have given rise to a backlash of public opinion.

"The loopholes in America's corporate tax have grown so outrageous that our policymakers should be embarrassed," said Steve Wamhoff, CTJ legislative director. "The data in this report demonstrate that a huge portion of the supposedly 'offshore' profits are likely to be U.S. profits that are manipulated so that they appear to be earned in countries like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands where they won't be taxed. Policymakers should close the loopholes that make this manipulation possible."

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. has spent a lot of time talking about its own tax laws in relation to large multinationals that repatriate abroad in order to duck its 35 percent income tax rate, but so far little has been said about these companies' new host governments.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/US-Multinationals-300x300.jpg" alt="US Multinationals" />

This seems to be changing now that the European Union has <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/business/international/eu-to-investigate-countries-business-tax-breaks.html?_r=0">opened an investigation</a></span> into the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> tax </span>arrangements had between countries like Ireland and the large multinationals that they attract, according to The New York Times. The inquiry is being led by Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, and covers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/ireland-announces-plan-to-close-apples-tax-loophole/">Apple's arrangement in Ireland</a></span>, Starbucks' in the Netherlands and Fiat Finance as well as Trade in Luxembourg.

"In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes," Mr. Almunia <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-663_en.htm">said in a statement</a></span>. "Under the EU's state aid rules, national authorities cannot take measures allowing certain companies to pay less tax than they should if the tax rules of the Member State were applied in a fair and non-discriminatory way."

Ireland has become the tax-haven of choice for multinational tech giants to hang their hats as a result of its low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate and its habit of providing them with further concessions, The New York Times explained. This strategy allows Ireland to attract revenue and jobs from giant, profitable companies that otherwise may have gone elsewhere.

For its part, Ireland maintained that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/sec-clears-apple-tax-practices/">Apple received no special tax deal</a>,</span> which would be illegal under EU law, according to the news source. Further, the country expressed its intention to vigorously defend itself, if necessary in European Court. Apple echoed the statement.

		<content><![CDATA[Walgreens is just one of many U.S. companies to consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/walgreens-urged-undergo-tax-inversion/">lowering its tax bill by moving abroad</a></span>. This move, called an "inversion," involves purchasing a foreign company and using it to alter the corporate structure so that the U.S. company is technically a corporate resident of the low-tax foreign country.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/report-shows-much-walgreens-stands-gain-inversion/walgreen-taxinversion/" rel="attachment wp-att-4734"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/walgreen-taxinversion-296x300.jpg" alt="Inversion" /></a>Walgreens has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/files/OffshoringAmericasDrugstore.pdf">considering the move since April</a></span>, under pressure from shareholders such as Stefano Pessina, who is Walgreens' largest shareholder and the executive chairman of Alliance Boots, the company with which it would merge, according to a new report from Americans for Tax Fairness.

A Walgreens inversion would cost the U.S. more than $4 billion over the course of five years in lost tax revenue, the report found. At the same time, the company would continue to receive significant benefit from U.S. taxpayers. Approximately $16.7 billion of Walgreens' $72 billion in 2013 sales came from Medicare and Medicaid, government-funded healthcare programs.

The report also makes the argument that an inversion might give Walgreens an unfair advantage. Between 2008 and 2012, Walgreens paid a U.S. tax rate of 31 percent - close to the official tax rate of 35 percent. During the same period, competitor CVS Caremark paid an effective tax rate of 34 percent, and is currently not making an effort to move offshore. If Walgreens were to complete an inversion, its tax rate would sink to about 20 percent, which could give it an unfair advantage over competitors, or force them to make the same move.

Some shareholders<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/walgreen-shareholder-opposes-potential-inversion/">oppose the move</a></span>, including CtW Investment Group, which owns less than 1 percent of the company's shares, according to The New York Times. The group sent a letter to Walgreens' management explaining its position, citing possible removal from the S&amp;P 500, diminished shareholder protections in Switzerland and reputational risks as reasons not to carry out the inversion.

		<content><![CDATA[It is easy to discern a trend, especially in international taxation. One of the largest Swiss banks plead guilty to criminal charges for helping U.S. taxpayers avoid income taxes. <a href="/u-s-signs-six-new-bilateral-agreements-crack-tax-evasion/">C<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ountries continue to enter into FACTA agreements with the U.S</span>.</a> rather than be shut out of the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="u-s-corporate-tax-outlook-fueling-inversion-deals/"> international banking system and U.S. market</a>s</span>. U.S. Senators rail against Apple, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="google-hit-large-international-tax-bill/">Google and Microsoft for not repatriating profits earned from overseas operations</a></span>. Bills are introduced in Congress that will attempt to prevent inversions whereby domestic corporations attempt to realign ownership so that the entity becomes foreign.

<a href="international-tax-trends" rel="attachment wp-att-4749"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/interntaional-tax-trends-0011-300x300.jpg" alt="interntaional-tax-trends" width="300" height="300" /></a>Hidden in the background is the relentless assault against past practices through the issuance of more restrictive regulations. One example concerns notational principal contracts (NPC). One type of NPC, known as Total Return Swap, was designed to pass U.S. source dividend to a non-U.S. investor without causing income tax withholding to be imposed on the outbound payment.

In 2010, Congress, enacted IRC§871(m) to impose a withholding obligation on <em>dividend equivalent payments</em>. Such payments include substitute dividend payments and certain NPCs. The seven factor test contained in the 2010 draft regulations has been replaced with an objective test which measures certain changes. In the most elementary terms, if the derivative contract produces substantially the same economic result as outright ownership, the contract is subject to these rules.

The objective test applies to <em>equity linked investments</em> (ELI) that produce the same return without income tax withholding as would direct ownership of the underlying stock and receipt of the dividend net of withholding.

The essence of NPCs and ELI’s is that a foreign customer contacts a bank and states that it wants to buy shares in a domestic corporation. The bank constructs a contract that takes into account charges at the price of a stock over time and its dividend. This contract simulates ownership of the security itself but does not suffer withholding taxes because the dividend is received by the bank, a domestic taxpayer. The new rules evaluate the payments to be made based on changes in price and dividends received to classify these contracts as being subject to withholding. The new regulations apply to other investments, as well.

It remains to be seen what impact this will have on domestic banks and what other techniques evolve.

		<content><![CDATA[Yet another U.S. health care company is set to take part in a corporate inversion, in which a <a href="international-tax-trends"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S.-based firm merges with a foreign company</span> </a>in order to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad.

<a href="medtronic-latest-company-propose-tax-inversion" rel="attachment wp-att-4758"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Tax-Inversion-001-300x300.jpg" alt="Medtronic the Latest Company to Propose Tax Inversion" width="300" height="300" /></a>Medtronic Inc. is set to become the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-16/medtronic-is-biggest-firm-yet-to-renounce-u-s-tax-status.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">largest company ye</span>t</a> to perform a tax inversion with its plans to merge with former-U.S. company Covidien Plc., which has been incorporated in Ireland since 2009, according to Bloomberg. Both companies are multinational medical device producers with headquarters in the U.S., with Medtronic operating out of Minneapolis and Covidien, a former subsidiary of Tycho, operating out of Mansfield, Massachusetts.

"This is not about lowering tax rates," said Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak in an interview, according to the news source. "What we will have is access to the cash generated outside the U.S. We'll use that to invest much more aggressively in the U.S."

Ishrak is referring to the $20.5 billion of untaxed earnings that the company holds in offshore subsidiaries, Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant, explained to Bloomberg. The U.S. tax law requires that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/treasury-reaches-final-agreement-with-ireland-on-anti-tax-evasion/">multinationals pay taxes on money earned abroad</a></span> when they return it to the U.S. By incorporating in Ireland via a merger with Covidien, the company could freely use this money without triggering U.S. taxes.

Medtronic isn't just attempting to lower its taxes though - a merger with Covidien would help to make it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/medical-merger-part-of-tax-inversion-wave-1402876390">an all-inclusive supplier</a></span> for hospitals worldwide, according to The Wall Street Journal. Medtronic is one of the world's largest suppliers of heart and spinal implants, and is expanding aggressively into the hospital-services industry. Covidien specializes in surgical operating tools and devices. By merging, the companies would have a significantly broader range of offerings, which could prompt more hospitals to do the majority of their business with the company.

The White House has threatened to veto the bill, citing the $73 billion that it will add to the budget deficit over the next ten years.

"Whatever happened to all the rhetoric about getting our fiscal house in order? Out the window," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, according to the news source.

The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/sen-wyden-focus-restoring-tax-breaks/">House and Senate are at odds over the fate of the tax extenders</a></span>, many of which expired at the end of last year. The list of tax breaks has grown over the years to include over 50 provisions, and the cost of making all of them permanent would come to almost $1 trillion over the coming decade, The Wall Street Journal explained.

The House passed another bill that would lessen the tax burden on firms that convert from taxable corporate status to small business status, according to the news source. However, the Obama administration announced that it opposed the legislation.

"Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to fund tax breaks for businesses, while insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans," the White House said.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-clintons.gif" alt="The latest in the media is the revelation that the Clintons are using  financial planning strategies that will fall on their heirs at the time of their death. " />

According to federal financial disclosures, Bill and Hillary created residential trusts in 2010 and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/CIDsummary.php?CID=N00000019&amp;year=2012">shifted the ownership</a></span> of one of their homes into them the next year. The reason for this move is simple: by transferring the ownership of the home into a trust, any appreciation in the property's value will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-17/wealthy-clintons-use-trusts-to-limit-estate-tax-they-back.html">remain outside of the Clintons' estate</a></span>. Because the top estate tax rate is approximately 40 percent of all assets, this could potentially save the power couple hundreds of thousands of dollars.

While the move to reduce their tax liability is certainly nothing out of the ordinary for people in the former president and first lady's wealth class, the news comes at a time in which Americans are very aware of tax and wealth issues, and directly on the heels of another media frenzy. Just a few weeks ago, Hillary Clinton defended her <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/hillary-clinton-108162.html">$200,000 speaking fees</a></span> to The Guardian by explaining that she and her husband were "dead broke" upon leaving the White House, according to Politico. She added that voters didn't see her or her husband as part of the problem, because they paid ordinary income tax, in contrast to other wealthy individuals.

"If Hillary is going to run for President she might be advised to take a lengthy sabbatical from her $200k​ per pop speaking tour and private shopping sprees at Bergdorfs to try and reconnect with what's happening back here on Earth," wrote spokesman Tim Miller for America Rising, a Republican research group, according to the news source.

"Secretary Clinton's point is about paying your fair share in taxes, unlike leading Republicans who try to evade tax responsibilities using offshore loopholes," Adrienne Elrod, spokeswoman for the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record in response. "Mr. Miller has selective memory if he doesn't recall reports that Mitt Romney reportedly maintained more than $30 million in the Cayman Islands."

		<content><![CDATA[A number of states across the U.S. have elected to lower corporate tax rates and increase tax credits as of July 1, reversing the trend of increasing taxes in order to shore up deficits that began after the recession.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/States-Cut-Taxes-001-300x300.png" alt="Several states cut taxes " />

<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/30/stateline-tax-cuts/11766751/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to Stateline</span>,</a> a nonpartisan new service of the Pew Charitable Trusts, Indiana and Rhode Island businesses saw a drop in their corporate tax rates July 1.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="spacey-whips-votes-maryland-tax-credit/"> Maryland increased its tax credits</a></span> for companies working on cybersecurity, biotechnology and research and development. Idaho eliminated its sales tax on people and companies purchasing software through the cloud.

Governors and legislators are taking advantage of their states' improved revenue, hoping that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/tax-tips-get-businesses-ready-2014/"> tax breaks will encourage businesses</a> </span>to move to and expand hiring within their states, the news source explained. Considering the upcoming election, it is also possible that politicians are banking on tax breaks to curry public favor ahead of this November.

"In 2010, we really saw a lot of tax and fee increases to bring revenues into cash-strapped state coffers," Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers, told Stateline. "This year was the first year (since then) governors actually proposed tax and fee decreases. We've definitely seen a movement to try to reduce taxes and fees and encourage job growth."

Not all analysts agree that cutting taxes is a wise move for encouraging growth, however. Joshua Smith, senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, explained to the news source that most states have no way of knowing whether a tax cut is having an effect on hiring. In any case, Smith said one state's gain is another's loss. He advocates using the extra money to fund infrastructure building and repair to create jobs and make states more appealing to employers.

In a July 1 speech from the Georgetown Waterfront, President Obama echoed Smith's sentiments, calling for more investments in infrastructure and fewer tax cuts.

		<content><![CDATA[With the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/u-s-corporate-tax-outlook-fueling-inversion-deals/"> increasing frequency of corporate inversions</a></span> in recent years and the breakneck pace at which even <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-jersey-court-finds-overseas-job-search-not-sufficient-to-collect-unemployment-compensation/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">domestic corporations are shipping jobs oversea</span>s</a>, it isn't surprising that the U.S. government wants to find a way to incentivize big companies to keep their jobs here. With the election coming up, there seems to be little chance of any serious legislation passing through this year, but that hasn't stopped some politicians from trying.

<a href="new-durbin-bill-seeks-keep-corporations-exporting-jobs"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/file000162678218-001-200x300.jpg" alt="New Durbin bill " width="200" height="300" /></a>On June 23, Sen. Dick Durbin announced that he would be introducing the "Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act," which would give tax credits to companies that provide fair wages and real benefits, according to The Chicago Tribune. The bill would also close a loophole that gives corporations a tax break for activities like building a factory overseas.

Under the terms of Durbin's new act, employers that qualified would get a credit worth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140623/BLOGS02/140629954/durbin-dangles-tax-credit-to-keep-hqs-in-america">10 percent of the first $15,000</a></span> of wages earned by each employee, according to Greg Hinz of Crain's Chicago Business. In order to qualify, they would have to remain located in the United States for tax purposes, retain or increase the proportion of U.S. workers to foreign workers year to year and provide ACA compliant health insurance benefits. Companies would also have to pay at least 90 percent of their workers an hourly rate equal to 150 percent of poverty-level wages and offer 90 percent of non-executive workers a defined-benefit retirement plan, among a few other requirements.

"If Sen. Durbin were truly interested in creating good-paying jobs, like those in manufacturing, he should sponsor legislation cutting the corporate tax rate for American companies," Illinois Manufacturers' Association vice president Mark Denzler said in a statement, according to the news source. "It's time for real solutions, not more political games in an election year."

In response to criticisms, Durbin's team quoted remarks by Michael Graham, CFO for JMC Steel Group, Hinz reported. "We're glad that this bill is being proposed," said Graham. "It's going to help companies like JMC keep jobs in America and it's going to help us invest in capital expenditures."

		<content><![CDATA[Most U.S. politicians agree that the tax code should be dramatically revamped, but little has been done so far to accomplish this goal. In an attempt to spur reform, Rep. Sandy Levin, D-Michigan, published a report examining the corporate practice of shifting headquarters overseas in order to dodge U.S. taxes, <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/211466-offshore-tax-deals-on-the-rise-top-dem">according to The Hill</a>. Known as a  "tax inversion," the technique has become extremely popular in recent years.

<a title="By Martin Falbisoner (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AUS_Capitol_east_side.JPG"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/US_Capitol_east_side.JPG/512px-US_Capitol_east_side.JPG" alt="US Capitol east side" width="512" /></a>In total, 76 U.S. companies have moved their tax residences to overseas low-tax addresses since 1983, according to the policy research arm of Congress,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/business/ireland-s-tax-regime-comes-under-us-spotlight-again-1.1859127">The Irish Times reported</a></span>. Despite the popular belief that small island countries like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are the most used for tax-dodging, the most frequently used domiciles are Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Rep. Levin, who is a ranking member of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, introduced legislation in May that would limit corporations' abilities to conduct inversions, according to the news source. His brother, Sen. Carl Levin, introduced similar legislation in the Senate and questioned Apple on its use of Irish companies to reduce its tax liabilities at a Congressional hearing last year. Neither measure seems likely to become law before the November elections that will decide which party controls the two sections of the U.S. legislative branch.

"Barely a week seems to pass without news that another corporation plans to move its address overseas simply to avoid paying its future share of U.S. taxes," Congressman Levin said in a statement. "These corporate inversions are costing the U.S. billions of dollars and undermining vital domestic interests. We can and should address this problem immediately through legislation to tighten rules to limit the ability of corporations to simply change their address and ship U.S. tax dollars overseas."

		<content><![CDATA[Making a surprising move amid the state's budget crisis, New Jersey officials approved the third-largest economic subsidy in their state's history on July 10,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/07/nj_gives_260_million_tax_break_to_energy_company_with_political_ties.html">according to The Star-Ledger</a>.</span> The package of tax credits - worth $260 million over the course of the next 10 years - will go to energy company Holtec International, which plans to move a manufacturing plant to the Camden waterfront.

<a title="By Tony Webster (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASmoke_Stack_St_Paul_2618794838_o.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Smoke_Stack_St_Paul_2618794838_o.jpg/512px-Smoke_Stack_St_Paul_2618794838_o.jpg" alt="Smoke Stack St Paul 2618794838 o" width="220" height="256" /></a>The terms of the agreement include 395 jobs being added to the area, though 160 of these jobs will be moved from elsewhere in the state, according to the news source. The state Economic Development Authority estimated that New Jersey will realize a net economic benefit of $155,520 over the next 35 years from the project, though the company will only be required to stay in the location for 15 years.

There have been criticisms from both the left and the right regarding the subsidy, which has come at a time during which New Jersey is struggling to pay for schools, hospitals, pension obligations and property tax rebates, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2014/07/10/energy-company-gets-260m-in-tax-credit-to-move.html">The Philadelphia Business Journal explained</a></span>. Not going without remark is the fact that South Jersey power broker George Norcross, brother of State Sen. Donald Norcross, who co-sponsored the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, sits on the board of directors for Holtec International. Many also feel that $260 million is too much to pay for the creation of just 235 new jobs, which averages out to just over $110,000 per job, per year.

Holtec International CEO Krishna Singh had narrowed the options for the new plant down to Camden and Charleston, South Carolina, according to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the news source reported. Receiving the credit was key to the company's decision to choose Camden over Charleston, an otherwise lower cost option.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In 2012, Kansas lawmakers passed a large income tax cut that was intended to reduce revenue from taxes by a little more than 10 percent,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/upshot/kansas-tax-cut-leaves-brownback-with-less-money.html">according to Josh Barro writing for The New York Times</a></span>. Gov. Sam Brownback said at the time that these cuts would create "tens of thousands of jobs," which would more than justify the cut. This cut reduced tax rates and increased the standard deduction, as per usual, but also eliminated the tax on a number of income types entirely, including that on 1099-MISC income, which is sometimes referred to as "small business income."

<a title="By The All-Nite Images from NY, NY, USA (Abilene, KS) [CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AAbilene%2C_KS_(14177153829).jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Abilene%2C_KS_%2814177153829%29.jpg/512px-Abilene%2C_KS_%2814177153829%29.jpg" alt="Abilene, KS (14177153829)" width="512" /></a>Unfortunately, these cuts may have had an unintentionally large effect, as the state expected to collect $651 million from personal income tax in April and May, according to the news source. It received $369 million.

Unfortunately for Kansas, it seems that the tax cuts are also doing little to effect job creation, and employment figures have trailed both the national average and those of most surrounding states since he signed the bill, Barro explained.

Part of the problem may be a misunderstanding as to what "small business income" is. While there exists a stereotype of small businesses as the employment leaders that drive the economy, many on-paper small businesses do not employ anyone. A writer who freelances for a variety of publications, for example, is considered a small business, as is a contractor and anyone else who works for him- or herself.

Another problem is that many people are able to "shift" income from one category to another. By eliminating tax on 1099-MISC forms, Kansas made it extremely attractive to collect income in this way.

Finally, an economic study conducted in 2013 and published in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00288#.U7HMk5RdXTk">The Review of Economics and Statistics</a> </span>found that, while new companies create more jobs than old ones, small companies were no more likely than large companies to create jobs.

		<content><![CDATA[IRS published new regulations in January that would upset 25 years of treatment of the allocation of liabilities.  Under current rules, the determination of whether a liability is recourse to a partner (or related person) is determined by whether the partner has an obligation to make a contribution to any person because a liability is due and payable and the partner does not have a right to reimbursement from anyone. Under the proposed regulations, seven additional requirements must be satisfied before the partner may receive the allocation.  The seven rules, presented in an abbreviated form, are: (1) the partner must maintain a reasonable net worth; (2) the partner provide reasonable commercial documentation; (3) the term of the partner’s obligation does not end before the liability is due; (4 ) the partnership is not required to hold liquid assets in excess of the business needs of the partnership; (5) the partner-guarantor receives reasonable compensation in exchange for his guarantee; (6) the partner’s guarantee is not a "bottom-dollar" guarantee; (7) the partner is liable for the full amount of the other person's liability in the case of indemnity or reimbursement arrangement. Failure to satisfy all seven rules converts recourse debt into non-recourse debt. In fact, the proposed rules create a bias toward non-recourse debt.

<a title="By Reynolds (Library of Congress) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AIRS_Building.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/IRS_Building.jpg/512px-IRS_Building.jpg" alt="IRS Building" width="512" /></a>There is also a new net value requirement that acts to limit the amount of the liability that will be treated as recourse. The net value requirement also produces odd results. Assume A and B are partners in a limited liability company. If A guarantees the entire debt, it would be recourse to A. Assume, however, that A is a member of a partnership and the partnership guarantees the debt. The only asset of the partnership is its interest in the limited liability company and the new net value test prevents the liability from being allocated to A.

The examples in the proposed regulations suggest the potential for more strange results.  Partnership borrows $1,000 and partner A guarantees $300, while B guarantees the bottom $200. C agrees to reimburse A for up to $50.  A and B waive their rights against each other. Because A does not bear the full risk of loss on his guarantee, the proposed regulations cause $250 of the obligation to be treated a non-recourse despite the fact that A is liable to the bank for $300. The expectation is, of course, that A would have $300 of recourse debt allocated to him.

The effective date of the 752 proposed regulations is the date they are finalized. This means that liabilities and payment obligations incurred after that date will be subject to these rules. Many existing partnership agreements will have to be revised if new debt is incurred or payment obligations are undertaken.

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. House of Representatives voted July 11 to make permanent a temporary tax cut that allows businesses to write off 50 percent of the cost of new equipment in the year that it is purchased, according to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2014/jul/14/house-votes-to-make-business-tax-break-permanent/"> The Associated Press</a></span>. Proponents of the break argue that it makes it easier for businesses to invest in new equipment, while opponents say that it bestows little real benefit for a high price tag. The House approved the bill with all but two Republicans in a 258-160 vote.

<a href="house-votes-make-bonus-depreciation-tax-cut-permanent"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tax-Break-300x300.png" alt="Tax Break" width="243" height="243" /></a>"It's easy, if you want to grow the economy, encourage job creation and increase federal revenue, you support making bonus depreciation permanent," said Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, who sponsored the bill, according to the AP. "Permanency gives job creators the certainty they need to plan and invest in their businesses, including hiring employees."

The White House, which is threatening to veto the bill, countered by saying that the break "was never intended to be a permanent corporate giveaway," the news source reported. The bill adds $287 billion to the budget deficit over the next ten years, as no spending offset was included.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, expressed his frustration with the reduced government income during the July 11 debate,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/11/politics/gop-business-tax-cut/"> according to CNN</a></span>. A number of significantly smaller bills have been blocked in the House by Republicans' insistence that spending be offset by cuts elsewhere, including $3.7 billion to respond to children crossing the Mexican border, $11 billion to continue funding highway projects and $35 billion to fix the veteran's health care crisis.

"Wildfire season is approaching and there are not enough resources," said Doggett, according to CNN. "Our highways crumble, bridges literally fall down... While there is so much of vital needs that we just don't seem to have the resources to address, these same Republicans tell us that we can afford to borrow from the Chinese or the Saudis to deliver [tax cuts]."

		<content><![CDATA[Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew sent letters to the top lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on July 15, in an attempt to effect action on the issue of corporate tax inversions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/obama-administration-seeks-end-to-inversion-deals/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">according to The New York Times</a></span>. Inversions are the controversial - but popular - practice of merging with a foreign company in order to take advantage of a lower tax rate abroad.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/inversions-001-300x300.png" alt="Inversions" width="300" height="300" />Despite Lew's entreaties, the recent wave of inversions seems unlikely to slow down, with Congress unwilling or unable to make laws on the matter and Wall Street financial advisors continuing to encourage the practice, the news source reported. Two particularly large inversions appeared all but stamped and signed this week. Chicago-based drug maker AbbVie won tentative approval to acquire Ireland-based Shire for $53 billion, and Mylan, another U.S. drug maker, paid $5.3 billion for the European assets of Abbott Laboratories.

"What we need as a nation is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise or fall together," Lew wrote, according to the LA Times. "We should not be providing support for corporations that seek to shift their profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes."

Lew went on to explain that the U.S. multinational corporations that are undergoing inversions continue to benefit from their business locations in the United States, the U.S. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/intellectual-property-technology/">protection of intellectual property rights</a></span>, support for research and development, infrastructure and investment climate, all of which is funded by taxpayer dollars, the news source wrote. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-tax-inversion-offshore-treasury-secretary-jacob-lew-20140716-story.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chris Krueger, a senior analyst at Guggenheim Partners</span>,</a> explained that no real consensus exists among Democrats on the topic of inversions, and that the Republican consensus is against acting on the practice outside of the context of broader corporate tax reform.

With only 24 legislative days before the November elections, it is highly unlikely that Congress will act on the issue in the near future.

Tax inversion is a hot-topic as more and more US companies try this strategy to avoid income tax. Find out more about this topic here:

		<content><![CDATA[What do AbbVie and Shire; Walgreens and Alliance Boots GmbH; Pfizer and AstraZeneca; Medtronics and Covidien Plc; Perrigo and Elan;, Actavis and Warner-Chilcott have in common? They are companies undertaking corporate inversion transactions whereby the U.S. company seeks to save taxes by removing its worldwide operations from the U.S. tax system.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/c-inversions-001.png" alt="Corporate Inversions" width="300" height="300" />An inversion is the name of a transaction where the U.S. corporation (USCO) acquires a foreign corporation (FC); however, USCO is not the parent in the new structure. Instead, USCO places itself beneath FC in the corporate structure. Once the transaction is complete, USCO’s foreign operations are transferred from USCO to other companies within the group. The benefit of such an undertaking is that U.S. taxation of USCO’s worldwide operations is eliminated and the U.S. is left with taxing jurisdiction over only those activities taking place only in the U.S.

An internet search for stories reveals that the tax savings are substantial, often reciting a reduction in the overall effective tax rate of ten or twenty percent. This is achieved in several ways. First, techniques, such as patent boxes, are used to license intellectual property (IP) from low-tax jurisdictions in exchange for royalty payments to a licensor resident in low or no-tax jurisdictions. Second, the host country may not have controlled foreign corporation rules that accelerate taxation of income to the parent even before the income is repatriated. Third, the foreign tax credit calculations may become less troublesome without facing complex U.S. rules. Fourth, U.S. transfer pricing would apply to licenses into the U.S., not all jurisdictions as before the inversion.

There are legitimate business reasons for the companies combining, such as expanding product lines or achieving economies of scale. There are expanding markets around the world fueled by a burgeoning middle class that will be consumers of technology, retail products, healthcare and entertainment. China is but one example of a market growing to serve the needs of an expanding middle class. There is no reason for that market must be served by a U.S. corporation.

		<content><![CDATA[The IRS has made a ruling on IRA rollovers in order to close a loophole ruled on earlier this year.

<a href="irs-one-ira-rollover-per-year-2015"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IRS-001-300x300.png" alt="IRS" width="300" height="300" /></a>In January, a U.S. Tax Court judge ruled that the actions of tax attorney Alvan Bobrow and his wife were not allowed under the Internal Revenue Code, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.pacificawealth.com/irs-announces-new-ira-rollover-limitation/">according to Pacifica Wealth Advisors</a></span>. In 2008, the couple made a series of withdrawals and transfers among contributory IRAs, rollover IRAs and non-IRA investment accounts, keeping within the 60-day deadline for tax-free IRA rollovers. In effect, Bobrow and his wife were able to use this strategy to use their multiple IRA funds to obtain interest-free loans. Because they were keeping within the 60-day period, the couple assumed at the time that this was permissible by the IRS.

The ruling in the U.S. Tax Court case <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-14-15.pdf">Bobrow v. Commissioner</a></span>, T.C. Memo 2014-21 prompted the IRS to tighten IRA rollover rules, limiting taxpayers to one tax-free rollover of any part of a distribution from a single IRA to another IRA within a 365-day period, according to the news source. This rule goes into effect January 1, 2015.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/News/201410510.htm">According to the Journal of Accountancy</a></span>, the IRS has stressed that this rule - which is actually a new interpretation of Sec. 408(d)(3)(A)(i) - will not affect IRA owners' ability to transfer funds from one IRA trustee to another. Indeed, these transactions are not considered rollovers under Rev. Rul. 78-406, and so are not subject to the one per 365-day period limit.

As Pacifica points out, this decision makes things a little bit more complicated in some situations, such as for taxpayers who own both traditional and Roth IRAs. In any case, there is likely to be more scrutiny of IRA rollovers starting next year.

		<content><![CDATA[Corporate inversions, in which a U.S.-based multinational acquires a smaller, foreign firm in order to re-domicile in a new, lower-tax country, have become a serious issue in American politics recently. Now, it appears that this issue may be a powerful motivator in the upcoming midterm House and Senate elections this November, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/tax-inversions-turn-into-campaign-fodder-1405900499"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">according to The Wall Street Journal</span>.</a>

<a href="inversions-election-hot-button-issue"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/inversions-001.png" alt="Inversions" width="300" height="300" /></a>A renewed push coming from the White House brought the issue even further into the public spotlight, alongside a coordinated drive from the Democratic party to effect legislation that will limit or halt the practice, the news source explained. Many Republicans agree that the issue should be addressed, but are halting bills that would curb the practice, hoping instead for a complete overhaul of the corporate income tax. These right-wing politicians note that the U.S. has the highest on-paper corporate income tax rate in the developed world. They say that they haven't seen any proposals from the White House that would solve the problem.

Democrats have made a number of proposals that would alter the corporate tax code, including one that would change the requirement regarding the acquired company's ownership share of the joint company that is created in an inversion, according to the Journal. Currently, the requirement is that the foreign company's shareholders must be given at least a 20 percent share in the new company, meaning that it is frequently in the best interests of shareholders in the U.S. company to give up a portion of their shares in exchange for a significantly lower tax burden. A proposal from Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, would raise this requirement to 50 percent.

"This is an issue that understandably gets people very angry," Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told the news source. "If Republicans are going to oppose our efforts in this area, they are going to have to explain why they are shielding American corporations that are deserting the U.S. in order to dodge their obligations to the country and American taxpayers."

It seems that 2014 is the year of corporate tax inversions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/frank-l-brunetti/">Frank Brunetti</a></span> and I have written about this topic at tremendous length due to all the new information brought to light about this subject.  Find out more about the companies involved in corporate tax inversion and what Washington is doing about it here:

		<content><![CDATA[Billionaire investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has a message for U.S. multinational corporations considering an inversion.

<a href="mark-cuban-protests-tax-inversions"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tax-Inversions-300x300.png" alt="tax inversions" width="300" height="300" /></a>"If I own stock in your company and you move offshore for tax reasons I'm selling your stock,"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban"> Cuban said in a series of tweets</a></span>. "There are enough investment choices out there."

Corporate inversions refer to the practice of a large U.S.-based company acquiring a smaller, foreign company, merging and declaring corporate residence in the latter country. Usually, this move allows the new company to enjoy a significantly lower tax rate compared to the U.S. rate of 35 percent - one of the highest in the developed world. In recent years, there has been a spate of tax inversions as politicians promise to crack down on the practice.

In a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101860770">CNBC interview, Cuban clarified his point</a></span>, insinuating that the tax cost to wealthy investors of allowing inversions would, in aggregate, cost them more than the gains seen from holding shares in inverted companies.

"Evaluate [the] big picture," Cuban told investors via CNBC. "By not selling your stock, does that encourage other companies to do the same thing, which means even larger tax shortfalls, which it costs us even more over the long-term, which means your net-worth is going to go down?"

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2014/07/25/mark-cubans-no-fan-of-tax-inversions/">In another interview with CNBC</a></span>, President Barack Obama acknowledged that corporate inversions are still technically within companies' legal right, but insisted that the practice is un-American, according to America's Markets.

"I think most people would say: 'If you're doing business here, if you're basically still an American country, but you're simply changing your mailing address to avoid paying taxes, then you're really not doing right by the country and by the American people,'" Obama told the news source.

Considering the senate elections draw near, the topic of corporate tax inversions is becoming talked about more and more through Washington. As<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> tax attorneys in the metropolitan area</a>, James F. McDonough and I have written about this topic at considerable length.

		<content><![CDATA[Republicans may cast a vote this year to repealing the estate tax in the U.S., according to House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Michigan,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-30/house-may-vote-this-year-to-repeal-estate-tax-camp-says.html"> Bloomberg reported</a></span>. Camp told reporters July 30 that a number of House members haven't had a chance to cast their vote on the issue yet.

<a href="house-republicans-talk-repealing-estate-tax"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Repealing-the-Estate-Tax-001.png" alt="repealing the estate tax" width="300" height="300" /></a>"It's been a long time since we've had a vote on total repeal," Camp said, according to the news source. "Obviously, I don't believe death should be a taxable event."

The bill, which would end estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, is being sponsored by 221 members of the House of Representatives,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140722/FREE/140729969">according to Investment News</a></span>. This is three more than is needed for a House majority. The bill would also make a 35 percent gift-tax rate permanent, with a $5 million lifetime exclusion.

There are a number of members who are motivated to get this vote for political reasons," Palmer Schoening, executive director of the Family Business Coalition told the news source. "It's the most popular bill in the Republican conference right now."

Indeed, with virtually no chance of the bill passing the Senate before the November election, and still facing a veto from President Barack Obama, it is more likely that Republican members of the House want to showcase their position on this issue ahead of the midterm elections.

In his 2015 fiscal budget, Obama proposed a top estate and gift tax rate of 45 percent with a $3.5 million individual exclusion for estates and a $1 million exclusion for individuals, indexed for inflation, Investment News reported. Democrats favor expanding the estate tax, because they argue that eliminating or reducing it would almost exclusively benefit the extremely affluent.

President<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="clintons-criticized-estate-planning/"> Bill Clinton vetoed a similar bill</a></span>, and President George W. Bush signed a law that allowed the tax to expire for 2010 only, according to Bloomberg.

This estate tax repeal is directly involved with another topic regarding transferable taxes to future generations called gift tax. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/james-f-mcdonough/">Tax attorney and co-editor James F.

		<content><![CDATA[As the U.S. public becomes more aware about <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">corporate taxation issues</a>, the topic of corporate inversions has become highly politicized. A number of politicians have gone as far as to call multinationals that perform the move "un-patriotic," ahead of the November midterm elections.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Corporate-Tax-Base-001.png"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Corporate-Tax-Base-001-300x300.png" alt="Corporate Tax Base " /></a>Meanwhile, there are other, less controversial taxation issues that could potentially cause a larger problem. The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-05-14/pdf/2014-11115.pdf">rules regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts</a>, or REITs, were recently clarified by the IRS.

While a little clarity is usually a good thing, this move <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2014/07/31/how-reit-spinoffs-will-further-erode-the-corporate-tax-base/">opens the corporate tax base</a> to a floodgate of REIT spinoffs, according to Forbes. This is an issue, because shifting assets into a REIT effectively eliminates corporate tax on them. As long as a REIT earns at least 75 percent of its income from rent or sale of real property and distributes 90 percent of its earnings to shareholders, it can usually be considered exempt from the 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax. Shareholders pay tax at the ordinary, considerably lower rate.

In the past, IRS rules on REITs were so unclear that firms needed to get a private letter from the agency ruling on each spinoff, the news source explained. After the recent IRS guidelines were published, a small but growing wave of spinoffs has been occurring. Any company that holds significant real assets, like oil companies, railroads, data centers and telecoms to name a few, can potentially take advantage of this type of tax strategy.

The potential for erosion of the corporate tax base is extremely large. <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1.pdf">The Federal Reserve Board's Flow of Funds</a> report shows that $10 trillion of the $35 trillion in assets held by non-financial corporations is in real estate, much of which could potentially be subject to REIT spinoff.

By contrast, the U.S. stands to lose less than $20 billion over the next ten years from corporate inversions, according to a nonpartisan congressional research panel quoted by <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stands-to-lose-billions-from-corporate-tax-inversions-1405373537">The Wall Street Journal.</a>

The issue of corporate inversions is a complex and loaded issue. To focus on it to the exclusion of all other potential problems, however, could have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. government.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A few key Democratic Senators have asked President Barack Obama to act alone to end the practice of corporate inversions. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts; and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, sent Obama a letter Aug. 5 asking that he pass an executive order to eliminate or reduce the tax breaks companies see by undergoing an inversion, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

<a href="democrats-ask-obama-to-act-alone-on-inversions"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/inversions-300x300.png" alt="inversions" width="300" height="300" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporate tax law</span> allows inversions, but they have become highly controversial in the past several months. In an inversion, a U.S. multinational company acquires a smaller, foreign company and uses this event to "merge" with the company and re-domicile abroad. This enables the new company to pay a tax rate that is lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35 percent.

"Although we will continue to work toward a legislative solution to the problem, we urge you to use your authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks associated with inversions," Durbin, Warren and Reed wrote to Obama, according to the news source. "Inverted corporations take advantage of all the things American tax dollars provide — from tax credits for research and development, investments in transportation infrastructure, and strong patent and copyright protections, to profiting from taxpayer-supported programs like Medicare and the Veterans Health Administration. Yet, these companies claim to be foreign corporations when it's time to pay their tax bill — denying the United States billions of dollars in tax revenue and thereby increasing the tax burden on other U.S. taxpayers."

There has been some serious debate<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/business/Action-in-washington-on-corporate-inversions.html">regarding the legality</a></span> of an executive order in this situation, The New York Times explained. In a controversial article written a few days after the president raised the issue of inversions, former Obama administration Treasury Department official Stephen Shay suggested that the Treasury secretary could use the power to determine whether a given financial instrument should be treated as debt or equity to remove incentives to re-domicile abroad.

		<content><![CDATA[After the loss of comedy icon Robin Williams, the entertainment community is still reeling in shock. One ray of light for Williams' relations, however, is that his well thought-out estate plan seems likely to leave his heirs in good hands.

<a href="robin-williams-estate-plan-leaves-heirs-good-hands"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Williams_Robin_USGov_crop-001-225x300.jpg" alt="Estate Plan" width="225" height="300" /></a>Large sums of money, extreme attention from fans and the stress of living life in the public eye often work together to result in poorly thought out estate plans. The result can be will executions that play out on the public stage, higher than necessary tax liability and unintended consequences for heirs. As Trial &amp; Heirs reported, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman's estate suffered from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://trialandheirs.com/blog/celebrities/philip-seymour-hoffmans-highlights-critical-estate-planning-pitfalls">just these critical problems</a></span>.

<strong>Two trusts</strong>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2014/08/12/whats-next-for-robin-williams-family-and-estate/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to Forbes</span>,</a> it appears that Williams created at least two different trusts. His two valuable pieces of real estate are held in the name of the "Domus Dulcis Domus Holding Trust," the Latin translating to "home sweet home." This trust names Hollywood producer Stephen Tenenbaum and New York accountant Joel Faden as trustees. By transferring the ownership of his real estate into a trust, Williams was able to avoid the substantial estate tax rate that would otherwise become due upon his death.

Williams also created another trust in 2009,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/12/robin-williams-trust-kids-children-money-will/">according to TMZ</a></span>. This trust, which the news source managed to obtain a copy of, entitles his three children, Cody, Zelda and Zachary, to equal sums. These sums were in turn split into three equal payments to be received at the ages of 21, 25 and 30. This allowed Williams to pass on his fortune without worrying about the high estate tax or that his heirs would squander their fortune young.

One further benefit of creating a trust rather than a will is that trusts can remain private when not leaked and published, like the one reported on by TMZ. This is distinct from wills, which become public domain.

As a <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/james-f-mcdonough/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tax attorney</span>,</a> I've written extensively about organizing your own estate planning. Check out some of my most recent posts on this subject:

		<content><![CDATA[Corporate taxation has become an important issue in the U.S., as budget deficits loom and an important election approaches. Many U.S. companies have said that high corporate income tax is onerous and reduces their ability to compete globally.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/corporate-income-tax.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/corporate-income-tax-300x300.jpg" alt="corporate-income-tax" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2014/08/12/20-big-profitable-u-s-companies-paid-0-taxes/">According to USA Today</a></span> analysis of S&amp;P Capital IQ data, however, there were at least 20 companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 that reported paying an effective tax rate of 0 percent or lower for the second quarter of 2014. To be included in the analysis, the companies had to report positive earnings, including unusual items, before taxes.

One such company was drug-producing giant Merck, which had a negative effective tax rate of 7.5 percent for the second quarter, according to USA Today. In other words, taxpayers gave the company the equivalent of 7.5 percent of its quarterly profits in tax credits. Merck's pre-tax income rose 52 percent during the quarter, coming to $1.9 billion.

This anomalous tax rate was attributed to the "beneficial impact of foreign earnings" in the company's filing, but Merck also got a significant one-time tax benefit from an option exercise that involved AstraZeneca's purchase of its interest in a partnership, the news source explained. AstraZeneca has also been under public scrutiny with regards to corporate tax practices.

President Barack Obama and other liberals have been<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="democrats-ask-obama-to-act-alone-on-inversions/"> making corporate taxation a major issue</a></span> ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. Both sides of Congress agree that tax code reform is necessary, but many analysts agree that the political deadlock will prevent anything from happening before the elections determine the shape of the next two years.

		<content><![CDATA[Trends come and go and taxation is no different. The change in 2001 to raise the estate tax exemption, now $5,340,000, and to lower the top estate tax rate, now 40%, shifted the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">emphasis in estate tax planning</a></span>. The combined estates of most American couples will remain below $10,680,000, so estate tax is no longer a factor for these taxpayers. Recent changes in individual tax rates has caused another shift. Individual tax rates for capital gains were 15% rate in 2001; however, today capital gains are now taxed at 23.8% before state income taxes are considered. Although it is easier to avoid estate tax with the higher exemption, the heirs may lose 8% more on a sale of the asset. <a href="/understanding-the-perks-exclusions-of-the-gift-tax-law/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planning for the multiple generations</span> </a>requires consideration of stepping up the basis of assets.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/estate-tax-planning.png"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/estate-tax-planning-300x300.png" alt="basis of assets" /></a>The plan, for individuals who do not reside in New Jersey and whose state death tax law tracks the federal exemption, is to hold assets until death and step-up their basis. In New Jersey, this strategy attracts a state death tax because the state exemption is only $675,000. Assume a combined estate at the first death of $2,775,000, where $675,000 is placed in a bypass or credit shelter trust at the first death and $2,100,000 remains in the hands of the surviving spouse. At the second death in New Jersey, $106,800 of New Jersey estate tax would become due; however, the assets would receive a step-up in basis and could be sold by the estate or heirs without income tax. If that same couple resided in Florida, there may be no estate or income tax.

Assume the assets of the bypass trust grew in value to $1,000,000, there would be no<a href="/new-jersey-real-estate-tax-liens-and-bid-rigging/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> New Jersey estate tax to pay on the incremental growth</span>.</a> The $325,000, if taxed in the survivor’s estate, would attract an 8% tax or an additional $26,000. Notwithstanding, $325,000 of gain subject to state and federal income tax at a combined rate of consisting of 29.325%, 23.8% federal and 5.525% state using individual, not trust, tax rates. The strategy to save New Jersey estate tax of $26,000 costs $95,306 income tax.

If the assets, consisting of the $2,775,000 combined estate plus the hypothetical appreciation of $325,000 were held by the surviving spouse until death and reported in the taxable estate, the basis of assets would be fair market value and there would be no income tax on a sale shortly after death. The New Jersey estate tax on $3.1m would be $190,800. Compare that figure to $202,106, comprised of $95,306 of income tax and $106,800 of New Jersey estate tax.

The analysis ignores the ability of the second spouse to relocate to Florida, for example, and hold all of the assets until death.   The example points out that trusts need to be more flexible, a topic to be covered in the next blog.

		<content><![CDATA[In an<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp14138.pdf">International Monetary Fund Working Paper published recently</a></span>, Ruud De Mooij and Ikuo Saito discussed the effects of the Japanese government's upcoming corporate tax cut. The current Japanese tax on corporate income is 35 percent - on par with the American tax. After the cut, Japan's rate will be reduced to 30 percent, leaving America's corporate income tax as one of the highest in the developed world.

<a href="imf-japan-may-unable-afford-corporate-tax-cuts"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japan-001-300x198.png" alt="Japan" width="300" height="198" /></a>The IMF's annual Article IV consultation with Japan noted the need for the country to lay out a concrete, medium-term plan to reduce its debt,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.tax-news.com/news/Japanese_Corporate_Tax_Cut_Needs_To_Be_Funded_IMF____65471.html">according to Tax-News</a></span>. Even if another consumption tax increase were to be implemented in 2015, Japan's gross debt-to-GDP ratio would remain over 240 percent. The IMF concurred with Japan that a cut in the corporate tax rate could lift investment and economic growth in the consultation, but cautioned that this cut would not be self-financing. The Fund concluded that Japan should only proceed with such a measure if other measures were taken to offset the resultant revenue loss.

In the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/08/05/can-japan-afford-to-cut-its-corporate-tax/">IMF working paper and an accompanying blog post on iMFdirect</a></span>, de Mooij and Saito explained that there is actually limited room for expansion of the Japanese corporate income tax base.

Why should we care? A growing number of American politicians and corporations are calling for a reduction in the U.S. tax code that is at least equal to, if not greater than, the one the Japanese are implementing. In many of these arguments, the work of Arthur Laffer is referenced, specifically "Laffer curves." In this context, the reference is to the idea that a sufficiently high tax rate actually reduces revenues because of its extreme distortionary effects.

Some proponents of the corporate income tax cut in Japan have also referenced Laffer, suggesting that a reduction in the tax rate would lead to a sufficient expansion in the Japanese base that revenues will ultimately increase without the need for offsetting measures, according to de Mooij and Saito. While the U.S. is lucky to have the chance to watch a similar reduction in the tax code go into effect, the IMF writers caution in their Working Paper that empirical literature on corporate tax elasticities suggest that there will be a far more modest effect on the base.

		<content><![CDATA[After finding some success in pressuring Deerfield, Illinois-based <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=walgreens">Walgreens not to invert</a></span>, Sen. Dick Durbin has set his sights on another multinational in his home state.

<a href="sen-durbin-urges-hospira-invert"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sen.-Dick-Durbin-199x300.jpg" alt="Sen. Dick Durbin" width="199" height="300" /></a>The Senator sent a letter to the CEO of Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira on Aug. 14, urging them not to undergo a corporate inversion, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-durbin-hospira-tax-inversion-20140814-story.html">according to The Chicago Tribune</a></span>. An inversion is the process of acquiring a smaller, foreign company, merging the two companies and then using the opportunity to re-domicile abroad. This often allows companies to enjoy a significantly smaller tax burden and spend any money from foreign profits that it has held abroad in foreign subsidiaries.

"I strongly urge you and the Board of Directors not to duck your corporate responsibility by moving overseas to dodge paying U.S. taxes," Durbin wrote in the letter to CEO Michael Ball, according to Crain's Chicago Business. "A significant portion of Hospira's revenue comes from U.S. taxpayers and depends on U.S. taxpayer-funded support."

In discussing money from U.S. taxpayers, Durbin was referring to technologies purchased through taxpayer-supported programs, like injectable drugs and infusion tech, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140814/BLOGS10/140819899/durbin-to-hospira-dont-make-a-move">according to the news source</a>. Programs like the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare have "contributed to Hospira's corporate success."

Some critics have accused Durbin and other Democrats of making corporate inversions an election issue in response to growing public awareness of and frustration with the practice. Crain's Chicago Business also noted that, while Durbin appears to have been successful in blocking Walgreens from moving abroad by publicizing the issue, Hospira has less to lose in the game of public opinion, as it isn't a consumer brand.

Durbin helped to introduce the "No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act" recently, which would bar companies that undergo an inversion from receiving federal defense contracts. Such a bill might be effective in some cases, but is unlikely to pass before the November election.

As tax attorneys I've analyzed the approach Senator Durbin has been taking in regards to corporate tax inversion. If you would like to read more, here are a few my previous posts on the subject.

		<content><![CDATA[Amid all of the recent news coverage of American multinational corporations inverting to redomicile in distant foreign countries, a massive deal is going down just next door.  Burger King announced this morning that it reached a deal with Canadian fast food restaurant Tim Hortons, which primarily serves breakfast fare. If the proposed merger were to go through, the resultant company would be the world's third-largest fast food restaurant chain, with a total of more than 18,000 outlets and roughly $22 billion in system sales.

<img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Inversion-001.png" alt="" width="364" height="320" />At least part of this fervor likely comes from the plans to create a new, publicly traded company headquartered in Ontario Canada. Why Canada?

There are a number of benefits for Burger King in seeing this inversion through. First of all, Canada's top corporate tax rate in Ontario is 26.5 percent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2014/08/25/burger-kings-tax-inversion-and-canadas-favorable-corporate-tax-rates/">according to Forbes</a></span>. This includes both the top federal rate of 15 percent and the provincial corporate tax rate of 11.5 percent, making for a significantly lower rate than the federal rate of 35 percent experienced by Burger King currently.

The hidden gem may be the Canadian treatment of a foreign affiliate's “exempt surplus.” Dividends paid from exempt surplus are generally exempt from Canadian tax by virtue of a 100% dividends received deduction.  Canada uses a combined exemption and credit system applies to dividends received from a foreign affiliate, including a Controlled Foreign Affiliate. Imagine all of the profits held offshore by US companies, such as Apple, Microsoft and Google escaping tax upon repatriation to the parent. Small wonder why Canada was chosen.

Burger King also operates in about 100 countries. This means that its earnings in foreign countries would be protected from the U.S. tax rate, as the U.S. is one of the only developed countries in the world to tax global income for corporations and individuals.

It is still too soon to tell what the long term effects of the Canadian government's move will be.

Corporate tax inversion is an extremely hot topic right now in the United States, so much so, it has even spread into Canada. <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/frank-l-brunetti/">Frank Brunetti</a> and I have been keeping up with this topic since the beginning.

		<content><![CDATA[As numerous other states make similar moves, New Jersey is considering estate tax reform.

<a href="new-jersey-considers-estate-tax-reform"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Estate-Tax-Reform-001-300x300.png" alt="Estate Tax Reform" width="300" height="300" /></a>A bill has been introduced to the New Jersey state legislature that would repeal the inheritance tax and raise the size of the estate tax exemption to the federal level, <a href="http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/08/25/new-jersey-looks-to-repeal-lift-estate-tax-exemption/">according to The Real Deal.</a> Currently, New Jersey is one of just two states left in the U.S. to tax both estates and inheritance.

This means that estates that are larger than the state exemption - $675,000 in New Jersey - are first taxed under the estate tax,<a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/a-push-to-reform-how-n-j-taxes-heirs-1.1072688"> according to NorthJersey.com</a>. Then, the remaining money can be taxed a second time when it is inherited, up to a maximum rate of 16 percent. Spouses, children and parents are exempt from the inheritance tax, but siblings, cousins, other relatives and friends are not.

The threshold for estate taxes at the federal level is $5.34 million - considerably larger than the New Jersey exemption. The federal exemption is also indexed for inflation, meaning that it increases to stay in line with the value of the dollar.

Proponents for a higher exemption argue that many middle class families accumulate an estate of $1 to $2 million in the form of real estate equity, and that we should not necessarily penalize them for accruing this modest level of wealth over a lifetime.

On the other hand, Department of Treasury data cited by NorthJersey.com found that almost $760 million of the total state budget of $32.5 billion will come from estate and inheritance taxes this year. Those who oppose raising the exemption to the federal level argue that doing so would result in a loss of tax revenues that would have to be paid for another way.

		<content><![CDATA[With the November midterm elections approaching in the U.S. and corporate tax reform heavy on the public's mind, a number of radical solutions have emerged. One such system is the value added tax, or VAT, proposed by former Treasury official and professor at Columbia Law School Michael Graetz, as <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/14/better-tax-code-fix-consumption/14075277/">reported on by Delaware Online</a>.

<strong><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/VAT.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/VAT-300x200.jpg" alt="VAT" /></a>How it works</strong>
A VAT functions very similarly to a consumption tax, with the one exception that it is applied every time value is added. This means that under a 10 percent VAT, a dairy farmer who sells a liter of milk for $1 is charged 10 cents. A cheese plant that turns around and sells that liter of milk as cheese for $3 would be charged 20 cents - 10 percent of the $2 in added value. This process goes on indefinitely until the product is sold to an end consumer.

<strong>Benefits</strong>
There are two key benefits that make a VAT potentially very attractive in the current environment. The first is that consumption is massive - far larger than any other taxable base. Even a tiny increase in a consumption tax or VAT can produce massive revenue gains for the federal government. The second is that a VAT is designed in such a way that it is virtually impossible to evade. While a business can shift its corporate headquarters abroad or transfer paper assets to a foreign subsidiary, there are few - if any - recourses to paying a VAT.

<strong>Detractors</strong>
Opponents of a VAT argue that this system is necessarily regressive. While consumption taxation is flat in that everyone buying the same object is paying the same tax, the poor have to devote a higher share of income to consumption than the rich. Graetz's system attempts to solve this problem by eliminating income tax on households making less than $100,000 per year, but other systems like basic income, negative income taxation and a system of vouchers have also been proposed.

		<content><![CDATA[One aspect that has confounded the estate planning world in recent years is the inheritance of digital assets.

<a href="delaware-legislates-digital-assets-estate-planning"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/digital-asset-2-300x300.png" alt="Digital Assets" width="300" height="300" /></a>While many of these assets usually hold only sentimental value - like social media profiles, email addresses, etc. - some can be extremely valuable. Now that so much of our financial life can be conducted online, via investment websites, wallets containing Bitcoin, Dogecoin and other digital currencies, or even online bank accounts, it has become important for states to make laws regarding how they should be passed down to heirs.

As of late last week, the Delaware House of Representatives passed House Bill 345, the "<a href="http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis147.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+345/$file/legis.html?open">Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets and Digital Accounts Act</a>," which gives the authority to take control of digital accounts and devices to heirs and executers.

The law is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which was created by the Uniform Law Commission, a non-profit organization, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/delaware-legislates-inheritance-digital-assets/">according to CoinDesk.</a> So far, Delaware is the only state that has passed legislation based on the UFADAA.

<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/if-you-die-in-delaware-your-heirs-can-get-all-of-your-digital-belongings">Estate planning attorney Jim Lamm, one of the authors of the UFADAA</a>, explained the need for access to digital information in the event of a persons death to Motherboard.

"In some cases, people have virtual real estate worth thousands or even millions of dollars," Lamm told the news source. He added, "if I die, and my wife knows the password to my Facebook account and accesses it, that's a federal crime."

Lamm explained that already about 20 states are getting ready to introduce similar bills following Delaware's decision, and that interest has been generated in countries abroad, as well.

In the digital age, as more people conduct business online, the importance for digital wills is likely to grow.

		<content><![CDATA[As companies wait to see what Congress will do in the coming months, the resultant decrease in corporate tax revenues is likely to have a negative effect on the U.S. budget picture.

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/U.S.Budget-300x225.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/U.S.Budget-300x225.jpg" alt="U.S.Budget" width="300" height="225" /></a>The U.S. budget deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2014 is predicted to be $506 billion, an almost 3 percent increase from the level of $492 billion predicted in April, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/27/us-usa-congress-budget-idUSKBN0GR1FD20140827">according to a report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office cited by Reuters</a>. This $14 billion increase in the deficit is more than accounted for by a $36 billion decrease in the estimated level of revenue coming from corporate tax payments. The currently anticipated level is $315 billion, down from an estimated $351 billion in April.

CBO officials said that the larger budget deficit stems from companies that are deferring tax payments while they wait on Congress, which is expected to vote on whether it will extend a number of expired tax breaks, according to the news source. These extenders cover an extremely broad range of activities, including renewable energy, school teachers' expenses, multinational corporate finances and even Puerto Rican rum.

The anticipated deficit is considerably lower than those in recent years, marking a significant decrease from the previous fiscal year's $680 billion, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/us/politics/budget-office-raises-deficit-estimate-for-fiscal-year-to-506-billion.html">according to The New York Times</a>. This year also marks the fifth consecutive decrease in the federal budget deficit as a share of the U.S. gross domestic product. In the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit represented 9.8 percent of the GDP - much higher than the 2.9 percent slated for this fiscal year and below the average deficit of 3.1 percent of the GDP over the last four decades.

The U.S. budget deficit is expected to remain below 3 percent of the GDP through 2018, but then rise to almost 4 percent in 2022 as spending outpaces revenues, according to Reuters.

		<content><![CDATA[Unlike other <a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/?s=social+issues">election years, in which social issues have tended to dominate the discourse</a>, the upcoming election is largely focused around tax law - specifically corporate tax law. As a part of his campaign, independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has been posting "memes" that include pictures of himself alongside memorable quotes.

<a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/503145708065943552" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Senator-Bernie-Sanders-300x148.png" alt="Senator Bernie Sanders" width="463" height="227" /></a>

This one in particular, which depicts Sanders holding an orange microphone, has garnered attention. The text reads, "Want to better understand why we have a federal deficit? In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent. It's time for real tax reform."

In terms of political efficacy, the meme is right on point. A growing sentiment in America says that the rich should be made to bear a higher tax burden in response to the massive wealth inequality experienced in the post-recession country. Concerns about corporate tax evasion, especially the hot-button issue of corporate inversions, could not be higher.

<a href="&quot;Sanders swearing-in3&quot;. Licensed under Public domain via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanders_swearing-in3.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Sanders_swearing-in3.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bernie-Sanders-300x199.jpg" alt="Bernie Sanders" /></a>In short, the statement is sensational. This sensationalism led <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-tax-share-paid-corporations-ha/">PolitiFact.com to verify the statement</a>, resulting in a "mostly true" verdict. The Senator's figures were almost exactly on the money, but two important factors cast doubt on the truth behind the statement's meaning.

1. PolitiFact​.com determined that the year was cherry-picked. In fact, 1952 was the third-highest year in history for corporate tax as a share of GDP, coming at a time when the U.S. was at the top of its game from an industrial perspective. That said, later figures show a smaller, but still significant decline in corporate taxation as a share of GDP.

2. The rise of "pass-through" organizations changed the shape of the corporate taxation landscape. Because of changes in tax rates and rules, many businesses now pass all profits onto shareholders or investors, meaning that no corporate income tax is collected. These shareholders must still pay taxes individually, further skewing the trend away from corporate income tax.

This week Senator Bernie Sanders made the news with this comments on tax reform. As tax attorneys both <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/frank-l-brunetti/">Frank L.

		<content><![CDATA[Governor Rick Scott  has launched a bus tour as part of his re-election campaign based on his state's 2014-2015 executive budget, dubbed the "It's Your Money Tax Cut Budget," <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IYMTCB.pdf">according to the Florida Gubernatorial website</a>. The budget intends to cut $500 million in taxes by <a href="http://www.newjerseybankruptcynow.com/paying-the-piper-part-1-of-2/">paying down debt</a>, eliminating government waste and reducing taxes and fees.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Governor-Rick-Scott-214x300.jpg" alt="Governor Rick Scott" />In the governor's budget highlights, Scott claims that this move will help to create more jobs and increase growth in the Florida economy. The plan features seven key policy decisions, including:
<ol>
<li>Eliminating sales tax on commercial leases</li>
<li>Introducing new tax holidays worth an estimated $200 million</li>
<li>Further reducing state corporate income tax</li>
<li>Eliminating sales tax on manufacturing equipment</li>
<li>Reducing local telecommunications service sales tax</li>
<li>Reducing automobile registration fees</li>
<li>Introducing a constitutional amendment that restricts property tax increases</li>
</ol>
Reactions to the budget have been mixed. While proponents argue that these reductions in taxation will help to create an economic environment more <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/customers-improving-relationships-increases-business/">favorable to business, helping to drive growth</a> in the state, opponents argue that the state lacks the funding to accommodate these tax cuts.

<a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/governor-rick-scott-offers-mixed-bag-tax-proposals-florida">An analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a Washington tax think tank, examined the proposal and gave it a mixed review. It is worth noting that the Tax Foundation is generally considered to have a conservative slant, making it somewhat surprising that the organization declined to back the budget proposal.

The main points that the Tax Foundation criticized were the restrictions on property tax assessment and tax holidays. The think tank stated that, while restricting property tax assessments can reduce local taxation, this is only possible via accompanying legislation that restricts property tax rates, standardizes assessing practices and limits other local revenue sources.

Tax holidays increase compliance burdens and do little to promote economic growth, the foundation argued. While tax holidays make for good politics in an election year, the policy can be distortionary and is less effective than reducing sales tax revenue through a narrow across-the-board reduction in rates.

		<content><![CDATA[The <a href="/tax-foundation-unveils-top-state-business-tax-climates/">Tax Foundation</a>, a think tank that examines issues of public tax policy, released a new report ranking the tax codes of the 34 developed countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

<a href="tax-foundation-ranks-us-tax-code-31-34-developed-nations"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tax-code-300x225.jpg" alt="tax code" width="300" height="225" /></a>The U.S. was ranked poorly, coming in at <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/report-us-tax-code-3rd-worst-among-developed-nations-2014-9">number 31 out of 34</a>, according to Business Insider. Estonia, New Zealand and Switzerland came in at Nos. 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Only Portugal and France were ranked below the U.S.

"The United States scores poorly largely because it maintains the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world at 39.1 percent and is one of the six remaining countries in the OECD with a worldwide system of taxation," the Tax Foundation said, according to the news source. "Its poorly structured property, individual, and capital gains and dividends taxes also contribute to the low ranking."

Estonia in particular was praised for having "the most competitive" tax code in the developed world, including a 21 percent tax rate for individuals and corporations. The U.S. corporate income tax is 35 percent, a level that has received criticism for being one of the highest in the developed world.

While the Tax Foundation maintains that it is non-partisan, a number of left-leaning figures have alleged that the think tank holds a conservative slant. Notably, Paul Krugman has accused the organization of a pro-business agenda in a piece titled, <em><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/the-greek-menace/">The Greek menace</a>.</em>

Whether the think tank maintains a slant or not, this recent report highlights the importance of taxation issues in America. Corporate inversions in particular have drawn heavy criticism for taking tax dollars out of the country. As the November elections draw closer, expect to see further rhetoric from all sides.

		<content><![CDATA[During an interview with CNBC, former President Bill Clinton discussed corporate taxation and the controversial practice of "inverting," a tax move that involves merging with a company in a low-tax country to obtain foreign tax status.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bill-Clinton-001-300x262.jpg" alt="Bill Clinton" />Taking a stance that has been frequently espoused by conservative politicians, Clinton told CNBC's Becky Quick that the U.S.'s high corporate tax rate will no longer work, <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/09/23/clinton-says-corporate-tax-rate-he-approved-needs-to-change/">according to Fortune Magazine</a>. When the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent was put into effect under the Clinton administration, it was roughly equivalent to other first world nations. Now that many of these countries have lowered their corporate tax rate, many multinational companies are tempted to take advantage of lower rates abroad.

Clinton stressed that the Treasury department is simply functioning as intended in attempting to stem the tide of inversions, the news source reported. He explained that the root of the problem can only be solved via a bipartisan solution from Congress.

"America has to face the fact that we have not reformed our corporate tax laws," Clinton told CNBC, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/obama-bill-clinton-corporate-taxes_n_5870908.html">according to The Huffington Post</a>. "We have the highest overall corporate tax rates in the world. And we are now the only OECD country that also taxes overseas earnings on the difference between what the companies pay overseas and what they pay in America."

The latter part of this statement refers to the "global" system of taxation used almost exclusively by the U.S. Under this system, a U.S.-based company that makes money in Ireland, for example, must first pay the Irish tax of approximately 12.5 percent, then the remaining difference between this and the U.S. tax of 35 percent - in this case 22.5 percent.

The Huffington Post connected Clinton's statements with the anticipated run for president by his wife, Hillary Clinton. Voters may take this as a signal that Hillary will pursue an agenda of corporate-friendly economic policy.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2647.aspx">The U.S. Treasury Department announced Sept. 22 </a>that it will move to disincentivize the practice of corporate inversions. A corporate inversion occurs when a multi-national business merges with a company overseas to take advantage of the lower tax environment to be had there.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Inversions-203x300.jpg" alt="Inversions" />Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew explained to reporters on a conference call that a comprehensive tax reform with anti-inversion provisions would be the best way to stop the practice, but that the Treasury would be rolling out a new set of measures to diminish the tax benefits that companies can obtain via an inversion, <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/09/22/obama-administration-releases-new-rules-to-fight-tax-inversions/">according to Fortune Magazine.</a> These measures include eliminating some of the ways companies can gain access to deferred foreign subsidiary earnings without incurring taxes and decreasing the ownership share that owners of the U.S. company may hold in the new combined entity to below 80 percent.

"Inversion transactions erode our corporate tax base, unfairly placing a larger burden on all other taxpayers, including small businesses and hard-working Americans," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said. "It's critical that this unfair loophole be closed. Now that it's clear that Congress won't act before the lame-duck session, we're taking initial steps that we believe will make companies think twice before undertaking an inversion to try to avoid U.S. taxes."

<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102037314#.">CNBC</a> noted that the recently announced Burger King-Tim Hortons deal is still likely to meet these new criteria. While they may kill off some deals that are currently in the works, it is probable that new strategies will appear that allow companies to reduce their tax burden in similar ways without falling foul of the law. The news source quoted an old joke in the corporate tax industry: "What is the difference between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion? One year."

		<content><![CDATA[The issue of corporate taxation has taken center stage in many policy-makers' minds across the world, yet difficulties in agreeing on a solution seem to have resulted in an effective "paralysis." <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21618911-big-economies-take-aim-firms-running-circles-around-their-taxmen-transfer">According to PwC and OECD data cited by The Economist</a>, the global average <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=corporate+income+tax">corporate income tax</a> as a share of profits is continuing to drop precipitously. From an average of over 19 percent in 2004, the figure had dropped to roughly 16.5 percent by 2012. As a percent of GDP, the average revenues from corporate income tax for the OECD rose to a high of just over 3.5 percent in 2006 before falling in the recession to approximately 2.25 percent. This figure did recover by 2012 to just below its 2004 level of about 2.8 percent.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/OECD-300x205.jpg" alt="OECD" />n response, the 2012 G20 called on the OECD to find consensus as to how to close the loopholes in international tax standards that multinationals exploit to lower their bills, according to the news source. After two years, the OECD presented its plan to the 2014 G20 on Sept. 20 for approval, which it received.

The proposal attempts to curb a number of practices and is to be followed by a second part next year. Practices that would be banned or curbed include "transfer pricing," by which multinationals shift profits to low-tax countries by charging fees between different subsidiaries they own, and "hybrid mismatching," which allows companies to claim double deductions by classifying financial instruments as debt in one country and equity in another. Additionally, it would allow member countries to share information about multinationals' assets, sales, profits, etc among other measures.

Unfortunately, the next stage is genuinely much harder, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/05/tough-talk-tax-means-nothing-country-does-different-things">according to The Guardian</a>. Agreeing to a measure at the G20 is one thing - expecting every OECD country to embed the measures into the more than 3,000 tax treaties of global trade is quite another. Clearly, many countries are dedicated to ending the "race to the bottom" that has characterized global corporate tax policy issues over the last several years, but the current measure should be considered with some skepticism.

		<content><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court decided that inherited Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) do not qualify as <em>retirement funds</em> and are not exempt from claims of creditors under the Bankruptcy Code §522(b)(3)(C). The Supreme Court resorted to the plain meaning of the words and held that <em>retirement funds</em> are sums of money set aside for an individual when he or she stops working. Under that view, IRAs may be divided into two types, ordinary and inherited. An ordinary IRA is exempt up to $1,245,475 and has a cost-of-living adjustment. There are additional exceptions for SEPs or SIMPLE IRAs which are not subject to the limitation. Rollovers from an ERISA qualified plans into an IRA are not counted toward the exemption limit.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Inherited-IRA-300x225.jpg" alt="Inherited IRA" />IRAs passing to spouses and children had been considered retirement funds, safe from bankruptcy, claims before the 2014 Supreme Court decision in <em><a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Clark-v.-Rameker.pdf">Clark v. Rameker</a>. </em>The decision requires one to look at the Bankruptcy Rules that may apply. A debtor in Bankruptcy may choose between the exemptions offered by the Bankruptcy Code or those offered by the state of the debtor’s residence. Certain states, such as Alaska, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Florida, adopted state law exemptions that protect IRAs. Wisconsin, the state of residence for the<em> Clarks</em>, adopted the federal exemptions, so there was no choice. Clearly, state law makes a difference.

New Jersey law exempts assets held or maintained in a “qualifying trust” and broadly defines the term to include trusts holding retirement plans, 529 plans and IRAs to name some. Why, you ask, are we concerned if we live in New Jersey?

I estimate that about only one-half of adult children, identified in our recent estate plans, reside in New Jersey. If a child is named as beneficiary of an IRA, it is the law of the child’s state of residence that will control the outcome. No one can predict where a child may reside or what state law might be in the future. The solution offered by some is the “Trustee IRA.” We must consider a beneficiary’s potential future creditors if an estate plan is to effectively transfer wealth to the intended beneficiaries.

The trust; however, cannot be a conduit trust. The trust must have the ability to accumulate income. Accumulation trusts for IRAs were not well received because trust income tax rates are higher than individual rates and because Minimum Required Distributions (MRD) for a group of beneficiaries were calculated using the life expectancy of the oldest living beneficiary. MRD rule discouraged the use of one accumulation trust for a group of beneficiaries of varying ages. Clients are not fond of the increased costs for separate accumulation trusts and portfolio management is inefficient.

State trust law also impacts asset protection. In <em>Tannen</em> <em>v</em>. <em>Tannen</em>, a New Jersey divorce case, I described the impact between different versions of the Uniform Trust Code upon the ability of a beneficiary or a creditor of the beneficiary to demand distribution that a trustee with discretionary authority distribute funds. This may necessitate flight or situs clauses that sacrifice efficiency for asset protection.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[With the midterm election on its way and partisan angst at an all-time high, it is easy to feel like necessary changes in U.S. policy will never get done. One particularly vitreous area of debate centers around the broken corporate tax code. According to some analysts, however, <a href="bipartisan-move-toward-corporate-tax-reform/">Republicans and Democrats </a>aren't as far off on major issues as many assume.

<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/220089-obama-tax-reform-overture-grabs-k-streets-attention">According to The Hil</a><a href="surprisingly-thin-aisle-tax-reform"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/taxreform-300x226.jpg" alt="Tax Reform" width="300" height="226" /></a>l, director of the National Economic Council Jeff Zients called the Obama administration framework "remarkably similar" to that of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp. "That makes me optimistic that we can get something done."

A number of other major figures have also noted that both sides want similar things out of <a href="?s=tax+reform">corporate tax law reform</a>, though many are not optimistic about the prospects of something happening in the next few years. One figure who is optimistic is Gene Sperling, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/gene-sperling-believe-it-or-not-corporate-tax-reform-is-doable-in-2015-1412808733">writer for The Wall Street Journa</a>l. Sperling compared Republican and Democrat priorities across various elements of corporate tax reform.

According to Sperling, the White House would like to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent for corporations and 25 percent for manufacturers. Republicans aren't far off with calls for a straight 25 percent tax rate. The difference represented by this 3 percent is the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, which helps to support high-skill jobs in the U.S. Ultimately, the difference appears surmountable.

Sterling found more similarities in comparing politician's priorities across the aisle in terms of the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=small+business">treatment of small businesses</a>, pass through entities and how to deal with foreign earnings. He even found significant room for compromises that could be acceptable to both sides on revenue neutrality and infrastructure spending.

What becomes clear is that the barriers to tax reform have much less to do with policy and more to do with brand differentiation. There may not be hope for tax reform before the November elections, but it may become possible in 2015.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Estate tax is often a confusing and difficult field in normal circumstances, but things can really get complicated when an estate's holdings are unusual. One of those unusual holdings is art, which is notoriously difficult to value. A recent ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court may serve to clarify the way that art can be treated under<a href="/?s=estate+tax"> estate tax law</a>.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ART-300x200.jpg" alt="art" />Affluent families that hold valuable pieces of art are often loath to part with them. If sentimental reasons aren't enough, frequently, the 28 percent capital gains tax on any appreciation of value is,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2014/09/24/big-art-collector-tax-win-in-fifth-circuit/"> according to Forbes</a>. However, if an estate breaks the federal estate tax exemption, these pieces of art are included in the estate tax bill at full market value.

James Elkins Jr., a prominent Houston, Texas businessman, and his wife who died before him gave partial shares of their art to their children, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/your-money/estate-planning/a-potential-game-changer-for-estate-taxes-on-art.html?_r=0">according to The New York Times</a>. This tactic is common for more typical assets, like<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/?s=+real+estate"> real estate or private business holdings</a>. By transferring shares out of their names, but retaining a controlling share in many, Elkins and his wife were able to keep their art on their walls but reduce their eventual tax liability upon death.

However, the IRS avoids giving discounts on art, because it is difficult to sell shares independently, the news source explained. Art can only be in one place at a time, and a severe discount would be necessary to sell less than a controlling share to a non-family member, as this new owner would have little say in where the art is displayed, for example. For this reason, the IRS claimed that no discount should apply to the art.

Now, in a major victory for the estate and art collectors across the nation, the Fifth Circuit has ordered that the IRS return $14.4 million to the Elkins family and said that the estate's initial 47.5 percent discount should be applied, according to Forbes.

		<content><![CDATA[The 'Oracle of Omaha,' billionaire investor Warren Buffet, is still touting the importance of higher taxes.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Higher-Taxes-001-183x300.png" alt="By SevaCall (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" />Buffet said Oct. 6 that the recent White House action to limit tax inversions - in which companies shift their headquarters outside the U.S. to lower their tax bills - provides a good "time out" for the government to work on a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/warren-buffett-corporate-tax-rules-111660.html">logical corporate tax code</a>, according to POLITICO. Buffet himself was criticized after his<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/want-to-know-where-the-pros-are-placing-your-money-hedge-fund-filings-now-available-for-review/"> Berkshire Hathaway</a> provided the financing for <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/burger-king-eyes-canadian-inversion/">Burger King's recent move to invert to Canada in a merger with Tim Hortons</a>. Buffet maintained that this move was about Tim Horton's sales, rather than taxes, but this isn't stopping the new company from taking advantage of Canada's 15 percent corporate tax rate.

While Buffet admits that the corporate tax code may be easier to fix than the individual tax code, this hasn't stopped him from bringing up its inherent inequality. In an exclusive interview, he told the news source that the tax on the wealthiest Americans is far too low, and that some of the top 400 earners in the U.S. - who have an average income of $200 million per year - still pay a tax rate of below 10 percent.

"That's still a lot less than my cleaning lady," Buffett told POLITICO editor-in-chief John Harris. "So it hasn't been fully corrected."

Buffet is famous for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/warren-buffett-taxes_n_5952776.html">pointing out this tax inequality</a> with himself as a prime example, according to Huffington Post. In particular, he has frequently pointed out that his secretary, Debbie Bosanek, pays a tax rate of 35.8 percent while he pays only 17.4 percent.

The reason for this inequality is the relatively low tax on capital gains, from which most <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">wealthy individuals</a> make the majority of their income. Proponents of the current situation argue that a high tax on capital gains discourages investment, but opponents feel that the middle class should not be taxed more than the upper class.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[On September 17, 2014, the New Jersey Division of Taxation announced a special initiative whereby businesses and individuals with unpaid tax liabilities could avoid some penalties, costs of collection and recovery fees.

<strong>The program ends on November 17, 2014.</strong>

Taxpayers would be required to pay all of the tax and interest. All penalties would be waived except for the Amnesty Penalty under the 2009 Tax Amnesty Law enacted by the legislature.   That penalty was imposed by statute on taxpayers who did not avail themselves of the 2009 amnesty program.

Taxpayers should determine the amount of tax and interest owed and compare that sum to their available cash. Please contact this firm if you need assistance in this regard.

All taxpayers may not be able to take advantage of this program; however, it is worthwhile for every taxpayer with an unpaid liability to the State of New Jersey to investigate the potential of the Special Initiate for resolving unpaid tax debts.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[A decision by the North Carolina Utilities Commission has triggered internal protest that highlights a rift between Democrats and Republicans. <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/welcome_page/?shf=/2014/10/14/4233720_tax-ruling-in-favor-of-nc-utilities.html">According to NewsObserver.com</a>, the commission has ruled that the state's utilities can continue to charge their customers for a corporate tax rate higher than the rate that they actually pay. This decision has introduced strong tensions between the commission's Democratic minority - who controlled the commission for years - and a Republican majority recently put into place by Gov. Pat McCrory.

<a href="clash-corporate-tax-nc-utilities-commission"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/corporate-tax-300x200.jpg" alt="corporate tax" width="300" height="200" /></a>In a 4-3 decision, the commission ruled that North Carolina utilities can continue to charge consumers for a corporate income tax of 6.9 percent, despite the fact that the state's corporate income tax was recently lowered to 5 percent by state legislature, the news source reported. Utility companies are allowed to pocket the difference.

"There is no set end to this over-collection, which will continue indefinitely each year until each utility's next general rate case," the commission's three Democrats wrote in their dissent, according to the news source. "Even then, ratepayers will never be refunded the over-collected funds; the utilities have simply been afforded an unearned gain at the expense of North Carolina ratepayers."

<a href="http://www.utilitydive.com/news/north-carolina-regulators-clash-over-corporate-tax-recovery/322415/">Utility Dive reported </a>that the state's utilities would be able to over-collect approximately $21 million per year based on the ruling. Ratepayers' average electric bills would increase by about 1 percent and average natural gas bills would increase by between 3 and 4 percent.

The majority wrote in their decision that the amounts considered are too small to require a change, according to NewsObserver.com. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are two companies opting to pass the savings on to consumers. They noted, however, that their customers would likely only pay 9 cents more and 17 cents more per month extra, respectively.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Despite insisting a few months ago that his company's upcoming merger with UK-based Shire was not for the tax impact, the CEO of U.S. pharmaceutical maker AbbVie blamed U.S. Treasury Department rules for its decision to shutter the deal.

<a href="abbvie-shire-deal-collapses-calls-corporate-tax-reform"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/corporate-tax-reform-300x300.png" alt="corporate-tax-reform" width="300" height="300" /></a>AbbVie explained in a recent statement that its proposed merger with Shire <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/abbvie-calls-us-corporate-tax-reform-55bn-deal-shire-collapses-1471002">had to been terminated</a> as a result of new regulatory measures that were introduced by the Treasury Department to reduce the tax impact seen in corporate inversions, according to International Business Times. Inversions are the process by which U.S. <a href="/eu-investigating-tax-breaks-us-multinationals/">multinationals acquire foreign competitors</a> in order to merge with them. The new company is able to be located abroad, where it can enjoy a lower tax environment.

"The Company's decision was based upon its assessment of the 22 September, 2014 notice issued by the US Department of Treasury, which re-interpreted longstanding tax principles in a uniquely selective manner designed specifically to destroy the financial benefits of these types of transactions," an AbbVie spokesperson said in a statement, according to the news source. "The notice introduced an unacceptable level of <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/are-two-heads-better-than-one-the-risks-and-benefits-of-a-joint-venture/">risk and uncertainty given the magnitude of the proposed changes</a> and the stated intention of the<a href="/us-treasury-moves-curb-inversions/"> Department of Treasury to continue to revise tax principles</a> to further impact such transactions."

Quartz reported on the <a href="http://qz.com/269829/did-barack-obama-just-crack-down-on-tax-inversions-or-what/">two key provisions</a> included in the new regulations.

First, the regulations change how ownership is calculated in the inversion. Currently, the shareholders of the foreign company are required to own at least 20 percent of the new company. This is still the case, but the government now won't allow "passive assets" like cash or securities, to be counted in the company's value. It also won't allow U.S. firms to pay large dividends to shareholders before an inversion in order to shrink their value.

Second, it is now more difficult for inverted companies to make use of the<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/?s=overseas"> tax free money that they have accumulated overseas.</a> A common practice among multinational companies is to keep money overseas so that it cannot be taxed by the U.S. government until it is repatriated. Foreign companies have no such difficulty. As per the new regulations, however, inverted multinationals will no longer be able to use this foreign money to make interest-free loans to their U.S. subsidiaries or move un-taxed cash stockpiles to the new foreign holding company.

"The unprecedented unilateral action by the US Department of Treasury may have destroyed the value in this transaction, but it does not resolve a critical issue facing American businesses today," said AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, according to IB Times. "The US tax code is outdated and is putting global US-based companies at a disadvantage to foreign competitors in an area of critical importance, specifically investing in the United States. Comprehensive tax reform is essential to create competitiveness and to stimulate investment in the economy."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[An Internal Revenue Service lawyer in the Office of Chief Counsel in New York is claiming that the organization's officials are giving away billions via tax evasion to corporations and the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-jersey-jury-awards-560000-whistleblower-verdict/">undermining of whistleblowers</a>.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Giving-Away-Billions-Via-Tax-Evasion-300x168.jpg" alt="Giving Away Billions Via Tax Evasion" />In a letter sent to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and copied to Sens. Chuck Grassley, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, IRS attorney Jane Kim requested that the<a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/589674/irs-gives-away-billions-by-allowing-tax-evasion-atty-says"> agency be audited</a> and investigated by Congress, according to Law 360. The most serious allegations include that the IRS is intentionally not acting on billion-dollar corporate tax avoidance cases. Kim described speaking with an attorney whose clients came forward to blow the whistle on three companies regarding the avoidance of more than $10 billion in taxes. Despite this information, the IRS allegedly declined to pursue the cases without looking into them.

"This is not a partisan issue, but a 99 percent versus 1 percent issue, in which the IRS seems to be placing 99 percent of American taxpayers on a grossly uneven playing field," Kim <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/10/whistleblowers-irs-officials-behind-fraudulent-multi-billion-dollar-corporate-tax-giveaways/">said in the letter</a>, which was published by Raw Story.

Speaking with Raw Story, the private sector lawyer and former IRS lawyer in the Office of the Chief Counsel, whose cases Kim references, said that these cases are representative of a deep trend in the organization.

"The problem is the IRS upper management don't want a big case going forward," the lawyer told the news source on the condition of anonymity. "They are purposely not working big cases. Employees are quietly encouraged not to expedite them, and to settle or dismiss them. I've seen the IRS sit on straightforward billion-dollar cases for years, and then decide not to pursue."

In her letter, Kim explains that she thinks the policies that govern the<a href="/irs-pays-out-38-million-to-whistleblower/"> IRS Whistleblower Office </a>are too small and ineffectual.

"These policies do not form a working mechanism to root out wrongdoing," Kim wrote. "The office seems to be drowning in thousands of untouched high-quality tips per year and multibillion-dollar cases its small workforce of 36 staff members is incapable of properly vetting."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The Tax Foundation, a think tank that tracks taxation issues, has released its latest ranking of states by business tax climate.

<img class="alignright" style="box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/climate-300x146.png" alt="Business Tax Climate " width="444" height="216" />According to the Tax Foundation, Wyoming is the <a href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/state-business-tax-climates-jobs-data-analysis.html">most favorable state</a> in which to do business. This was followed by South Dakota, Nevada, Alaska and Florida to round out the top five. The organization stated that among its top states, the absence of a major tax is a common factor. Wyoming, Nevada and South Dakota, for example, have no<a href="/?s=income+tax"> corporate or individual income tax</a>. Those that did levy all of the major taxes on the top ten list did so at a low rate.

The least favorably ranked states suffered from "complex, non-neutral taxes with comparatively high rates," according to the foundation. Topping the nclist was New Jersey, followed by New York, California, Minnesota and Vermont.

Nominally, the Tax Foundation is non-partisan, but many have criticized the organization as having a conservative bias. Its rankings have a tendency to vary more wildly from year to year than <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax laws</a> in those states, and some have suggested that the rankings in the state seem to have less to do with

Analysis conducted by Governing found that there was <a href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/state-business-tax-climates-jobs-data-analysis.html">virtually no correlation</a> between the employment-to-population ratio in a state and the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/how-does-new-jerseys-business-tax-climate-rank/">business tax climate</a> score. Similarly, there was a slight negative correlation between a state's median annual wage and business tax climate score, meaning that residents of states with more favorable business climates were slightly more likely to make less money in a year.

What is clear is that taxation issues aren't the only factor in determining the prosperity of a state. As economic issues becomes increasingly important to the American populous, many will pay attention to how these states do relative to their index scores.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Every year, there are a few individuals who want to <a href="new-jersey-considers-estate-tax-reform/">leave part or all of their estate</a> to their pet. Unfortunately, pets are considered property, and <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/property-owners-be-careful-what-you-wish-for/">property cannot own other property</a>. This leaves an interesting conundrum for dedicated pet owners, but there are a couple of ways around it. So, now the question remains - Can I Leave My Estate To My Pet?

<strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Can-I-Leave-My-Estate-To-My-Pet-300x146.png" alt="Can-I-Leave-My-Estate-To-My-Pet" width="513" height="250" />Leaving your pet to a trusted caretaker</strong>
The simplest and often most effective way to make sure that your pet will have a good life after you pass away is to leave the pet and the money for his or her care to a trusted caretaker. It is important that this be a person who you trust, however, because there is no legal obligation for him or her to use the money for the care of the pet.

The clause in your will would likely <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/estate-planning-pets.html">look something like this</a>, courtesy of NOLO:

<em>I leave my pet [name] and $[amount], to [trusted caretaker], with the hope that the money will be used for [pet's name]'s care and maintenance.</em>

Notice how it reads "in the hope." There is no legal recourse should that caretaker use the money on him- or herself.

<strong>Creating a trust</strong>
A more expensive and complicated, but ultimately more effective option is to create a trust that is designed to benefit your pet. In this trust, you will leave your pet and the money to the same caretaker, but this time the money comes with a legal obligation to care for the pet.

In this document, you can not only name the person who will care for the pet and the amount of money to be used for this care, you can also describe how you would like the pet to be cared for both after you die and before you die should you become incapacitated. You will also have to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">name an enforcer of the trust</a>.

This option is less flexible and more expensive, but it will ensure that your pet is cared for.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The 2014 midterm elections have come and gone, leaving the Republicans in control of both the House and Senate. In this new environment, is meaningful corporate tax reform a realistic possibility?

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/file0001857196846-300x225.jpg" alt="corporate tax reform" />According to the Washington Post, the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/former-senior-white-house-advisor-tapped-to-lead-expansion-into-washington-d-c/">Obama administration</a> is hoping that the now more secure Republican party will be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/04/why-obama-will-struggle-to-achieve-his-agenda-in-his-final-two-years/">willing to work with him</a> on a variety of issues. Notable among these is tax reform and infrastructure spending - issues that are intrinsically linked in the current environment.

There are <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/05-tax-reform-moment-blah-gale">two major obstacles</a> to <a href="/bipartisan-move-toward-corporate-tax-reform/">accomplishing tax reform</a>, according to the Brookings Institute. The first is the disagreement as to where cuts to corporate tax expenditures and interest deductions should be made. By and large, this is a disagreement within the business community. Because it is generally accepted that any tax reform will have to be revenue neutral, arguments surrounding corporate base broadening to support rate reductions are likely to play a major role.

The treatment of corporate revenue from foreign sources is the second major point of contingency. Republicans would like to implement a territorial system that would only tax revenue generated in the United States. This would dramatically reduce revenues from this tax, but Republicans argue that it would allow business owners who are currently stashing foreign-generated revenue in subsidiary companies to invest this money in the U.S. The left would prefer to implement a true worldwide system that would tax the income of<a href="eu-investigating-tax-breaks-us-multinationals/"> U.S. multinationals</a> wherever it is earned and deduct costs wherever they are incurred. Both sides agree that the hybrid system is a clumsy middle ground.

Zachary Goldfarb with the Washington Post noted that there is some room for compromise. In particular, the sequester cuts coming 14 months from now could potentially motivate Republicans to work with the president in order to avoid defense cuts. However, this wouldn't necessarily mean that either side would get more than the aversion of spending cuts that weren't intended to be made in the first place. It wouldn't mean the tax cuts that the right wants or the domestic investment that Obama wants.

		<content><![CDATA[Texas state legislators hit the ground running following the election, taking advantage of the Nov. 10 chance to pre-file bills for the coming 84th Legislature. The 84th Legislature doesn't officially start until January, but that <a href="http://www.caller.com/news/state/state-bureau/texas-lawmakers-file-first-new-bills-ranging-from-texting-while-driving-to-supporting-samesex_80369625">didn't stop lawmakers from</a> pre-filing bills that demonstrate where they stand on a variety of new and old issues, according to The Corpus Christi Caller Times. More than 300 bills had already been filed by noon on Nov. 10. Bills ranged from drug testing for welfare recipients to <a href="http://politickernj.com/2013/11/nj-lawmakers-seek-to-prohibit-lawsuits-against-text-senders/">texting while driving</a>. Democrats filed bills in favor of gay marriage and raising the minimum wage.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tex-300x199.jpg" alt="&quot;New Home Texas Water Towers 2011&quot; by Leaflet - Own work.

State Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, filed SB 134, which is intended to set up a permanent $5 million revenue exemption from the state business tax, also known locally as the gross margins tax or franchise tax.

<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/10/Texas-State-Sen-Estes-Introduces-Bill-to-Repeal-Business-Franchise-Tax">According to Breitbart</a>, State Sen. Craig Estes, R-Wichita Falls, went even further. The senator pre-filed SB 105, which would repeal the Texas business tax entirely. This would make Texas the largest state to have no tax on business or personal income tax, followed by Nevada, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming.

"The margins tax is a uniquely harmful tax," Sen. Estes told Breitbart Texas. "It has high compliance costs, picks winners and losers by treating similar businesses differently, and must be paid whether or not a business turns a profit. Passing the margins tax was a huge mistake and it should be repealed."

Breitbart did not note how the state would make up for the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">corresponding loss of tax revenue.</a>

The Caller Times noted that many of these bills are unlikely to make it through committee, though this legislature in Texas is slated to be more conservative than the last.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[With the real possibility of corporate tax reform being thrown about Washington, an old debate has been reopened regarding on whom the corporate income tax really falls.

<a href="corporate-income-tax-fall"><img class="alignright" style="box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/incometax-300x199.jpg" alt="corporate income tax " width="300" height="199" /></a>Those in favor of abolishing the corporate income tax - a stance that has become increasingly popular with some groups - argue that the corporate income tax necessarily falls on people. This is, of course, completely true. Other than money that sits in corporate accounts, which does no one any good, all of the money that passes through a business eventually makes its way to people. Except for the money taken out by taxes, that is.

It is easy to find writers, talk show hosts and politicians who are ready to argue that <em>you</em>, the consumer, are paying a large share of corporate income tax in the form of higher prices on goods. Tim Worstall, regular contributor to Forbes, says it <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/08/26/harvard-business-review-not-quite-right-on-corporate-tax-incidence/">frequently and with significant zeal</a>.

As Bruce Bartlett, who held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, pointed out in a piece for The New York Times, however, virtually all economists <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/who-pays-the-corporate-income-tax/?_r=0">roundly reject this idea</a>. The price of goods is set by market forces, not by corporate income taxes. While prices would likely be affected if corporations were the only suppliers of goods and services, they emphatically are not. There are also sole proprietorships, S-corporations, foreign corporations, nonprofits and partnerships. If a corporation were to attempt to compensate for higher corporate taxes by raising its prices, it would be undercut by businesses to which the tax does not apply.

Left are shareholders and employees. Bartlett cites an article by economist Arnold Harberger, who demonstrated that, at the time, the corporate tax was probably borne entirely by shareholders. There have been arguments that, over time, some of this burden is shifted to employees because the supply of capital shrinks in order to raise the rate of return.

Bartlett examined several analyses included in the March 2013 issue of The National Tax Journal that attempt to determine on whom the tax falls, but found little consensus. Two out of four articles supported the notion that shareholders bear the entire tax. A third suggested that labor bears a full 60 percent of the corporate tax burden, while a fourth found that 82 percent is born by shareholders, leaving workers with 18 percent of the burden.

Understanding where the burden of the corporate income tax falls is essential if we are to make an informed decision regarding tax reform. What appears clear is that the oft-repeated notion that consumers bear this burden is patently false.]]></content>

Last year, it was raised from $1 million to $5.34 million and indexed for inflation in order to stay in line with the rising cost of living. This change came in response to critics of the tax, who argued that a middle class family might easily accumulate $1 million in combined wealth and home equity over a lifetime due to the new 2015 estate tax exemptions.

As a result of the exemptions being indexed for inflation, the rate will now <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/10/30/estate-tax-exemption-for-2015-announced-by-irs/">increase to $5.43 million</a> in 2015, the IRS announced recently, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Only about 3,700 estates - about 0.12 percent of all U.S. estates - are expected to owe federal estate tax in 2014, the news source explained. In part, this is because married couples can claim two individual exemptions, bringing the total to almost $11 million. Even after this, there are a number of techniques that can be employed in order to <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/does-your-company-need-key-person-insurance/">minimize an estate before death</a>, thus minimizing the total tax liability. Even so, those who do incur a liability under this tax must pay a high rate - 40 percent - on amounts above the exemption.
<h2>Gift tax limits</h2>
The IRS also announced <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2014/10/30/irs-announces-2015-estate-and-gift-tax-limits/">gift tax limits</a> as one of the 2015 estate tax exemptions, according to Forbes. This is the amount that can be given away to a single recipient tax-free per year. In 2015, the annual <a href="/is-the-5-million-gift-tax-exemption-about-to-end/">gift tax exemption</a> will be $14,000, the same as it is this year.

While $14,000 may not seem like a lot compared to the exemption on the estate tax, it can be given away every year to as many individuals as the owner likes. A husband and wife can also both give gifts individually, effectively doubling this amount for married couples.

This means that a wealthy husband and wife with five beneficiaries could gift each of those beneficiaries $14,000 per year. That's $70,000 from the husband and $70,000 from the wife to make $140,000. Over several years, this is an extremely effective way to whittle down an estate.

Forbes also mentioned other ways around the 2015 estate tax exemptions. Gifts toward medical, dental and tuition expenses don't count toward the gift exemption if the provider is paid directly. Another tactic is to fund a 529 college savings plan for a child or grandchild. Five years of the annual exclusion can be put into one of these plans at once, coming to a total of $70,000 per year in 2015.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[In a report released recently, the Institute for Policy Studies found that seven of the largest 30 companies by revenue in the U.S. <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IPS_Fleecing_Uncle_Sam_Report_Nov2014.pdf">paid their chief executives</a> more than they did in corporate tax last year. According to the report, Boeing, Ford, Chevron, Citigroup, Verizon, J.P. Morgan and<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/general-motors-guilty-of-conscious-avoidance/"> GM all paid more to their CEO</a>s than they did in corporate taxes. All of these companies but Chevron received money back from the government in the form of a rebate or subsidy. This is despite the fact that the pre-tax revenues for these companies came to more than a combined $74 billion. In all, they received a combined net $1.8 billion from taxpayers - that comes to about $5.69 from every man, woman and child living in the United States.

Licensed under Public domain via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Uncle_Sam_(pointing_finger).jpg#mediaviewer/File:Uncle_Sam_(pointing_finger).jpg" width="223" height="300" /></a>CEO pay - a contentious issue in the United States - looked strikingly different. All of these CEOs received more than their companies paid in taxes, coming to a combined $121 million, but considering that all but one received money back from the government, this is hardly surprising.

What is striking, however, is that this state of affairs appears to be increasingly common, according to the report. Of the 100 top-earning CEOs in 2013, 29 received a larger salary than their company paid in taxes. On average, these 29 firms reported $817 million in U.S. pre-tax income, received $8 million in tax refunds and paid their CEO $32 million.

<strong>Disputed figures and characterizations</strong>
Speaking to Reuters, several companies <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/18/us-usa-tax-ceopay-idUSKCN0J20CJ20141118?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews">disputed the findings</a> of the Institute for Policy Studies. Verizon told the news source that it paid $422 million in income taxes in 2013 - a considerable difference from the negative $197 million cited in the report. Boeing said that its global 2013 tax bill came to $1.6 billion, but did note that all but $5 million was deferred.

By far, the largest tax refund recipient among the 30 top U.S. companies was J.P Morgan, according to the report. Of the $1.8 billion cited as the total refunds received, J.P. Morgan accounted for more than $1.3 billion. The company's CEO was paid a relatively meager $11.8 million.

It should be noted that a significant portion of J.P. Morgan's refund came from a tax deductible settlement made last year. According to the company's website, its total 2013 net income <a href="http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=819107">came to $17.9 billion</a> out of $99.8 billion in revenues. Under the U.S. top income rate of 35 percent, its tax bill would ordinarily come to about $6.3 billion.

However, the company agreed to a $13 billion settlement last year for its alleged role in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/20/us-jpmorgan-settlement-idUSBRE9AI0OA20131120">causing the housing crisis</a>, according to Reuters. Of that, $11 billion was tax deductible, which helps to account for a sizeable portion of the difference.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[President Barack Obama to veto corporate tax bill that would result in $440 billion in tax breaks. The bill, which would make 56 of the so-called "tax extenders" permanent, would <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7277935/tax-extenders-deal">primarily benefit businesses</a>, according to Vox. Tax extenders refers to a collection of tax breaks that have been inserted into the tax code on a temporary basis. While they regularly expire, many of them were never intended to be temporary. Hence, it has become all but routine to extend the bills year after year.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Barack_Obama_Fold-200x300.jpg" alt="&quot;Barack Obama Fold&quot; by realjameso16 - Flickr. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Barack_Obama_Fold.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Barack_Obama_Fold.jpg" width="200" height="300" />There are two main reasons for the faux temporary nature of the tax extenders, the news source explained. First, by never making the bills permanent, their notional cost in CBO scores is reduced. This helps to 'disguise' their impact on the national budget. Second, the tax extenders are extremely popular with the businesses that use them, triggering a regular routine of lobbying for their extension or expansion, which is good for incumbent members of congress.

This shouldn't necessarily leave a bad taste in your mouth. After all, the tax extenders usually have bipartisan support. Conservative legislators like breaks like the "bonus depreciation" rule, which gives businesses the ability to write off more of the cost of certain kinds of newly purchased equipment. Liberals like breaks like the subsidy for <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/new-jersey-adopts-measures-to-promote-solar-facilities-on-brownfield-sites/">renewable energy production.</a> Both sides of the aisle generally recognize that the Research &amp; Development tax credit is good public policy.

At the end of 2013, congress opted not to extend these tax breaks, Vox explained. However, most businesses expected that the tax extenders would be retroactively extended at the end of this year, and have behaved accordingly. As such, most legislators on both sides agree that putting an end to them entirely would be a poor decision. Obama is not proposing to do so, but key issues with the bill in its current form appear to make it unacceptable for the White House.

<strong>No working class cuts and slashed domestic spending</strong>
The first issue at hand is that making these cuts permanent would add $440 billion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. While this money would have been missing anyway, putting it on paper has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/business/congress-nears-deal-on-major-business-tax-breaks.html?_r=0">an unfortunate effect</a> on public policy going forward, according to The New York Times. Incoming Republicans in Congress have promised to balance the budget in that time without raising taxes or cutting military spending. This leaves only domestic spending to make up the difference - something Democrats are not happy about.

The other issue is in two <a href="/democrats-ask-obama-to-act-alone-on-inversions/">missing breaks valued by liberals </a>- a permanent expansion for the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit for the working poor. Neither was included in the bill, as Republicans claimed that the president's move to allow more legalized foreign workers would result in more people claiming the tax credit.

The Republicans do not have a majority to overturn a presidential veto, but a bipartisan effort might. The right could also compromise, creating a bill that would be passed by the executive branch. We will simply have to wait and see.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The estate tax exemption is the maximum amount of money that an estate can be worth without incurring the estate tax. Simply put, an e<a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/armour-v-indianapolis-do-unequal-taxes-violate-the-constitution/">state worth more than the current exemption</a> of $5.34 million - indexed for inflation - has to pay, while an estate worth less doesn't.

<a href="will-obama-lower-the-estate-tax-exemption"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jurvetson_-_Barack_Obama_on_the_Primary_by-300x270.jpg" alt="&quot;Jurvetson - Barack Obama on the Primary (by)&quot; by Steve Jurvetson from Menlo Park, USA - Barack Obama on the PrimaryUploaded by ComputerHotline. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jurvetson_-_Barack_Obama_on_the_Primary_(by).jpg#mediaviewer/File:Jurvetson_-_Barack_Obama_on_the_Primary_(by).jpg" width="300" height="270" /></a>The official budget put forth by <a href="/?s=obama">President Obama</a> in early March of this year suggests that this exemption may shrink slightly. According to CNN Money, the president would restore the 2009 exemption levels and rate, bringing the exemption <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/04/pf/taxes/obama-budget-taxes/">down to $3.5 million</a> per person and raising the tax rate to 45 percent from the current level of 40 percent.

Keep in mind that this tax rate, while relatively high compared to other taxes, is only applicable on the taxable part of the estate. That is, the amount by which the estate exceeds the exemption. Under the current exemption of $5.34 million, for example, an estate worth $6.34 million would be responsible for paying $400,000 or 40 percent of the $1 million left over after the exemption.

Should affluent individuals be concerned about this? James Hamill, writer for the Albuquerque Journal, <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/490317/biz/estatetax-exemption-cut-largely-mythical.html">argued that they shouldn't</a>. According to Hamill, this part of the proposal is supposed to apply only to post-2017 years. The president doesn't establish <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">tax laws with this budget</a>, he only suggests them. Considering that he will leave office in January 2017, and that this proposal wouldn't tax effect until the year after this, it would take action by a completely different Congress, spurred on by a completely different president, to make this happen.

While many Democrats are in favor of higher estate tax rates and a lower exemption, it doesn't appear in this light that Obama is particularly committed to this cause, according to Hamill. It does, however, create a better looking long-term budget forecast, which may explain its inclusion.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[I have reported on federal and state amnesty programs; however, no such program in this country can compare to what Russian President Vladimir Putin has put together for his country.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Vladimir_Putin_12024-300x234.jpg" alt="&quot;Vladimir Putin 12024&quot; by Russian Presidential Press and Information Office - kremlin.ru. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Putin_12024.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Vladimir_Putin_12024.jpg" />According to news reports, President Putin proposes a full amnesty for capital being repatriated to Russia. The report continues that if a person legalizes his holdings in Russia, he or she will not be questioned about his sources of funds or the means used to acquire these funds. The promise is that tax collectors, prosecutors and administrative agencies would not be able to inquire about the funds. While the United States launched several versions of its<a href="/voluntary-disclosure-program-enabled-irs-to-collect-5-billion-from-offshore-tax-evaders/"> Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative</a> (OVDI) and has been successful in collecting tax, interest and penalty, the Putin Plan is different.

First, it does not seek to collect taxes. Second, it offers the prospect of a hands-off approach to those citizens who may have crossed the line in methods used to acquire wealth, although the Rule of Law is not to be confused with the Rule of Putin. What the Putin Plan seeks is the inflow of capital.

There are three factors that were unanticipated by Mr. Putin and Russians who moved their capital outside of their country. First, the<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/will-crisis-in-ukraine-unfold-on-the-internet-with-twitter-again-playing-a-critical-role-in-global-affairs/"> crisis is the Ukraine</a> and the annexation of Crimea resulted in sanctions. The sanctions have hurt the Russian economy by depriving it of much needed capital. Mr. Putin is seeking to fill the gap by repatriating capital. Second, the drop in oil prices means that Russia, as a net exporter of oil, is unable to realize as much in the way of foreign currency. There are many influences on oil prices, such United States shale oil production, OPEC and Saudi Arabia. The third factor is currency weakening because of the drop in the demand for oil. If the growth of the economy will be stunted, the currency will continue to weaken.

Herein lies the challenge for Mr. Putin. United States citizens participated in OVDI because they intend to remain in the U.S. and they eliminated their risk of prosecution in most cases by participating in the program. There are three groups of Russians that have capital outside their country. Leaving aside the innocent, Russian organized crime and the wealthy oligarchs must determine if it safe to repatriate. The financial issue is whether it makes sense to repatriate capital to a country whose currency is weakening and may be blocked in the future.

The decline in the rubble creates headaches and <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">opportunities for tax professionals</a>. Certainly there will be some analysis required to liquidate and repatriate. The Putin program is a variation of tax amnesty, though on a larger scale because of the implied pardon. What is not clear is whether there sufficient stability and rule of law in Russia to make repatriation attractive. If Russia were to announce its intention to ratchet up an U.S. style enforcement program upon expiration of Putin amnesty, this may be sufficient incentive for some to repatriate funds.

		<content><![CDATA[With an increasing number of Americans feeling disconnected from the political process, it is heartening to hear stories in which public opinion and political watchdog groups have a <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/12/03/tax-extenders/">marked impact on political discourse</a>. According to Joshua Holland, a reporter for BillMoyers.com, that is precisely what is going on regarding the so-called tax extenders.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/political-watchdog-300x300.png" alt="political-watchdog" />The <a href="/?s=tax+extenders">tax extenders</a> are a set of tax breaks and subsidies that have been added into the tax code over the years on a temporary basis. The majority of these cuts apply to businesses, but some are directed at citizens, like the earned income tax credit or the credit for<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/general-motors-guilty-of-conscious-avoidance/"> energy-efficient appliances.</a>

Applying these cuts temporarily was intended as a way to allow politicians to test out their effects. Instead of making them permanent, however, legislators have instead chosen to renew them on a temporary basis year after year. This has allowed them to obfuscate their effect on the federal budget and to collect contributions from companies and interest groups lobbying for their renewal.

<strong>Influencing the conversation</strong>
For the majority of their existence - some since 1981 - little public outcry or fanfare has accompanied these bills' renewal. This was not the case this year, after two groups - <a href="http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Corporate-Lobbying-on-Tax-Extenders-and-the-GE-Loophole-3.pdf">Public Campaign and Americans for Tax Fairness</a> - released a report detailing what these bills do, how much they cost and how much is spent on the lobbying campaign that is pushing them through Congress. The authors pulled data from OpenSecrets to find that 1,359 lobbyists pressed Capitol Hill on the issue between January 2011 and September 2013 - about 10 percent of all registered federal lobbyists. About 58 percent of these lobbyists had worked for Congress or the executive branch at some point.

Writing the report was one thing, but influencing public opinion was another, according to BillMoyers.com.

"We did as much retail work as possible," Frank Clemente of Americans for Tax Fairness told the news source. "We held press briefings and did one-on-ones with reporters to make sure that they understood the story. It's like grassroots organizing - you have to do a lot of organizing to get the media engaged on issues like this."

While challenging, it appears that the authors' efforts paid off. The recent efforts to make the tax extenders permanent - conspicuously missing breaks for low income families - have been met with extreme public scrutiny. Those breaks may still pass in some form, but at minimum public controversy will prevent them from passing without notice.]]></content>

Spinning both companies into subsidiaries of a new, multinational fast-food company headquartered in Canada. New numbers released by tax watchdog Americans for Tax Fairness showed just how much Burger King will be saving after this move.

According to the report, the chain is already <a href="http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Whopper-Tax-Dodge.pdf">using aggressive tax planning</a> to keep its bills as low as possible. As a result, its worldwide tax rate is one of the lowest of any U.S. fast food company at 27.5 percent in 2013. By structuring its international activities around low tax countries and loading costs onto U.S. operations, for example, the company is able to minimize its taxable income in America.

One example of the way that many companies do this is by <a href="/?s=tax+evasion">moving the ownership of brands and logos to a subsidiary in a low tax region</a> and then charging exorbitant rates to "arm's length" subsidiaries in higher tax regions. This makes it appear that high tax subsidiaries are making little profit while low tax subsidiaries are making a lot.

The report looked into ways that Burger King could use its new status as a Canadian resident to avoid paying what would otherwise be U.S. taxes. It found that the company could avoid paying taxes on its current sum of $499 million in offshore profits - otherwise taxable under the U.S. "worldwide" tax scheme - to save $117. On future foreign earnings, this same change would save the company an estimated $275 million between 2015 and 2018. It also found that the top three holders of Burger King stock could use the unique structure of this deal to save on U.S. capital gains tax. The amount saved could be anywhere between $10 million and $820 million.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The <em>Last Known Address</em> rule embodies one of the great unrecognized perils of taxation. The rule provides that the IRS must send notices, such as a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/03/25/taxes-from-a-to-z-2013-n-is-for-notice-of-deficiency/">Notice of Deficiency for assessed taxes</a>, to the last known address. A taxpayer has 90 days from the date of the Notice of Deficiency to contest the deficiency in Tax Court otherwise the<a href="/?s=IRS"> IRS</a> may assess and collect the tax.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/last-known-address.png" alt="last-known-address James F. Mcdnough Tax Trust Estate News " width="570" height="292" />What constitutes notice of a change of address for purposes of the rule was the subject matter of much litigation. The government has attempted to provide some certainty through regulation and the use of <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/f8822.pdf">Form 8822 by taxpayers </a>to voluntarily notify the service of a change in address. As one might suspect, taxpayers do not file Form 8822 in every case. The IRS is charged with notice of a change of address where the taxpayer files a return with the new address. Many of the older cases involved taxpayers filing returns with a different service center because of relocation where the notice relates to a prior year whose return was filed in a different service center.

The IRS was deemed to have received notice of the change where it processes a subsequent return. IRS will also use the United States Postal Service database. Generally, if the taxpayer's old name and address match the old name and address in the Post Office's database, the new address in the Post Office database will be considered the taxpayer's last known address unless clear and concise notification is given to the IRS.

Despite case law and regulations providing guidance in the area, there remains some gaps. Consider a recent inquiry to this firm where a non-resident, non-citizen returns to his homeland and does not receive any one of a series of notices from proposed adjustments, through deficiency and levy. Clearly, the USPO data base was of no help to this individual who gave up his apartment many years ago.

There is another remote area that is not in the public consciousness and it involves audit procedures of partnerships. There are two types, TEFRA and non-TEFRA. TEFRA proceedings are designed to centralize issues under examination to eliminate inconsistent results in multiple audit proceedings of tiered partnerships by requiring a determination of the issues in one examination conducted at the highest tier partnership.  In <em>B<span style="text-decoration: underline;">edrosian</span></em>, the Tax Court issued majority, concurring and dissenting opinions in what may only be described as a nightmare of procedural errors and false steps. Although the case involved a Son of Boss tax shelter, the case is more notable because the taxpayer lost the opportunity to opt-out of the TEFRA proceeding and contest on a non-partnership basis. The TEFRA notice was sent to the last known address and thus was held to be valid and the fact that the taxpayer did not receive the notice was irrelevant. The last known address rule also allowed IRS to use TEFRA to extend what had been a blown statute of limitations on the audit which began as an non-TEFRA audit.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Much like nuclear fusion is said to be "always 50 years away," serious corporate tax reform seems to be perpetually an election away from being realized. The same news organizations that said for months that no serious reform was expected until after the midterm election are now seamlessly transitioning into saying that no reform is likely until 2017. Sadly, they are probably right.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/corporate-tax-reform.png" alt="Image by &quot;&quot;WDC Capitol 1&quot; by snty-tact (Talk) - snty-tact (Talk)'s file.. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WDC_Capitol_1.jpg#mediaviewer/File:WDC_Capitol_1.jpg&quot; used for Frank L. Brunetti's post &quot; &quot; on Tax Trust Estate News" width="516" height="256" />MarketWatch published a Dec. 16 article to this effect, noting - as many have recently - that the proposals by President Barack Obama and Republicans like Rep. Paul Ryan, soon to be House Ways and Means Committee leader, are <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/where-corporate-tax-reform-will-go-next-year-2014-12-16">not that different</a>.

Ryan would like to reduce the top corporate income tax rate to 25 percent while removing some tax breaks. Obama would like to lower it to 28 percent, lower the top rate on manufacturers to 25 percent and also remove some tax breaks. Sen. Rand Paul has said that he would like to pass a bill allowing the repatriation of offshore income held by multinationals. Obama has also said that he's open to this idea and would like to use the money to improve roads and bridges.

<strong>Why is it so hard then?</strong>
In the face of these aggressively reasonable <a href="/?s=corporate+tax+policies">corporate tax policies</a>, what is standing in the way? Passive momentum.

CNN Money explained that, first of all, tax reform simply <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/15/pf/taxes/corporate-tax-reform/">almost never happens</a>. For a tax code that is almost 100 years old, major reform has happened fewer than five times. Part of the problem is political quarreling: Even though both sides agree on many important points, they do not on many others.

Even if a bipartisan majority can be put together, there is still the need for both sides to "restrain those who see political advantage in not going along," co-director of the Center for Tax Law and Policy Michael Knoll explained to the news source.

The more moderate elements of Republican party are still working to gain back control of their party from the Tea Party caucus, which generally supports a more negative view of taxation generally. On the Democrat side of the aisle, populist figures are a<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates">dvocating for a tax code</a> that favors the working poor and a less economically unequal society.

International cooperation is another problem. One of the major reasons that the effective corporate income tax has fallen so dramatically over the last several years is the rise of globalization. As <a href="/?s=multinational+corporations+">multinational corporations </a>spread their wings, they can force different companies to compete for their tax dollars by shifting profits into more favorable locales. Many in the U.S. want to eliminate the almost exclusively American "global" tax system in favor of a "territorial" one, but without international cooperation, multinationals could exploit this to pay much less tax in America.

Perhaps most importantly, the public is neither enthusiastic, nor particularly informed about corporate tax issues. The last big reform in 1986 came after 10 years of public education on the issue, according to the news source. For that to happen in the modern day, another concerted effort might be necessary.

As many are predicting, election fever will likely grip the nation with another wave of partisanship before real cooperation on corporate tax reform happens.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[With all of the talk about whether or not <a href="/corporate-tax-reform-always-election-away/">tax reform is possible in Washington</a> right now, it is surprisingly easy to forget about the important side of the discourse: What is it that we want from a reformed tax code? Earlier this month, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, introduced tax reform legislation that completely <a href="http://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-introduces-a-comprehensive-progressive-pro-growth-approach-to-tax-reform">breaks the mold</a>. Will it pass Congress? Keep dreaming, but it does bring up interesting food for thought. Where mainstream politicians like departing House Ways &amp; Means Committee Chair David Camp, R-Michigan, and President Obama are suggesting relatively modest adjustments to the tax code, Cardin introduces a value added tax. The additional revenue from this tax would then be used to dramatically lower the current rates on corporations and individuals. You can read the full bill at <a href="http://www.cardin.senate.gov/pct">Progressive Consumption Tax.</a>

<strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/value-added-tax-300x149.png" alt="Tax Reform, Washington, Value Added Tax, Tax Legislation, Senator Ben Cardin" />What is a value-added tax?</strong>
In short, a VAT is a tax on consumption, much like a sales tax. Unlike a sales tax, which is only applied at the point of sale to consumers, a VAT is applied at every stage that value is added.

For example, if I run a ketchup factory, I need to purchase tomatoes. The distribution plants that buy tomatoes from farmers pay a tax on them. When I purchase tomatoes from the distribution plant, I pay the same tax on the tomatoes - at the new, marked-up rate - minus the amount paid by the plant. This way, each party is only paying a tax on the amount of value that was added in the previous stage.

Why would a VAT be desirable? First, even a <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/concerned-about-how-taxes-may-impact-your-wealth-check-out-scarinci-hollenbecks-new-video-series/">relatively small rate can generate a lot of revenue</a> because there is so much consumption in an economy. Second, a VAT is very hard to evade, minimize or not pay, because each link in the supply chain has to hold the other links accountable.

<strong>Lower rates on corporations and individuals</strong>
Cardin's plan also includes a reduction of the corporate tax rate to 17 percent from its current 35 percent and the exemption of most individuals from the corporate rate. Cardin believes that this would make the U.S. more competitive, possibly even attracting corporations looking to lower their rates - a dramatic turnaround from the current situation. While a VAT is inherently regressive, meaning that those with more money pay less in the VAT relative to their income, this would be corrected to a degree by the new individual income tax rates.

Those on the far left and far right are both unlikely to sign on to Cardin's plan. Liberals are unlikely to agree to a regressive tax rate, and conservatives are unlikely to sign on because of the potential for increased government revenues. Still, Cardin's bill helps to promote healthy discussion about how our society should be taxed.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The Internal Revenue Code is complex</h2>
<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/file8691288431924-300x225.jpg" alt="Want to understand the internal Revenue Code? First brush up on the rules of self employment taxes, unincorporated business and s elections." width="300" height="225" /></h2>
The fact that various internal revenue code sections are enacted into law does not necessarily mean that every nuance has been explored in crafting language. Often times, the collateral consequences of a new statute upon other areas of the internal revenue code is not considered. All too often the clean-up work of pruning obsolete regulations and drafting new ones for recently enacted statutes takes years.
<h2>Sometimes, it does not take place at all.</h2>
Consider the interaction between self-employment taxes (SET) and the form of business. In the past, partnerships were either general or limited. Two other species of partnership, the limited liability partnership (LLP) and the limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) were introduced. Tax concepts must be extended to apply to the new forms of business and this is not always easily done.

It is generally accepted that a general partner is properly considered to be self-employed for SET purposes. Most people contend that a limited partner’s distribute share is not subject to SET. There are, however, regulations to the contrary, 1.1402-(a)-2(g) and (h), that state that a limited partner must take his or her distributive share of partnership income or loss into account for purposes of SET. In 1977, IRC §1402(a)(13) was enacted and it replaced the statute upon which these regulations were issued.  The two regulations, were promulgated under statutes that were <em>replaced</em> thirty-seven years ago. In all those years, one set of proposed regulations was offered for comment and drew the ire of <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">tax practitioners</a> and has not been adopted.

The use of a<a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/does-your-small-business-llc-have-an-operating-agreement/"> limited liability company (LLC) by a sole proprietor creates other issues</a>. One issue is whether a member is considered a general or limited partner for SET purposes. Does the proper treatment depend upon whether the member renders services? Another issue arises from the election of <a href="/s-corporation-esops/">S corporation</a> status by a limited liability entity (LLC, LLP or LLLP) electing to be taxed as a corporation.  It appears that 1.1402(a)-2(h) prevents a sole proprietor from avoiding SET through the use of a single member LLC, electing to be taxed as a corporation and electing S status. The question is whether this particular regulation, which should have been withdrawn, is of any force or effect.

One suggestion is to use a limited liability limited partnership, where available, to provide the general and limited partners with limited liability while protecting the limited partners from SET on their distributive share of partnership income.  Taxation does not offer clarity in every situation and this one instance where so much confusion could be eliminated.

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Determining A Partner’s Interest In a Partnership</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/concept-partnership_fy6xK9rO-300x295.jpg" alt="concept partnership" />One might think that determining a partner’s interest in a partnership is easy and that strict rules provide absolute certainty. This is not the case.

The rights conferred by states under partnership, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/partnerships/">limited partnership</a> or limited liability company law do not define a partner’s interest for federal tax purposes. State law is interested in governing the relationship among partners and transactions between the partnership and non-partners. State law, though helpful in the federal tax analysis, does not control federal tax treatment. Federal tax law is more concerned with the economic arrangement among the partners. IRS of concern to IRS are the assignment of income to lower bracketed taxpayers, the shifting of deductions and losses and gift and estate tax.
<h2>Federal tax law relies upon a facts and circumstances test that is designed to adapt to imaginative tax planning that cannot be anticipated.</h2>
A partnership capital interest is very different from a partnership profits interest. A profits interest is given to a partner who must perform services and receives his or her reward from the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/venture-capital-markets-2015-may-match-2014/">profits of the venture</a>. If a partnership is liquidated shortly after capital contributions are made, but prior to the partnership generating revenue or expense, a service partner holding only a profits interest will not receive any distribution. The partners holding capital interests would receive a return of their contributions. Any shift of capital to a service partner holding only a profits interest results in compensation. If undertaken in a family setting, an assignment of income or a disguised gift is a possible unwelcome outcome.

During 2014, we were presented with two matters where the business terms were not clear at the outset of discussions. In one transaction, the service partner insisted upon receiving a credit to his capital account that would be immediately deducted from the capital account of the partner contributing property. This shift would result in immediate taxation to the service partner because the credit was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The second matter was a service partnership which allocated income in a subjective manner considering originations, services and account revenue increases. This raises the prospect of shifting or transitory allocations that the IRS may not respect.
<h2>A partner’s interest in a partnership is applicable to other areas aside from allocations of income and the distribution of cash.</h2>
The allocation of interest deductions directly <a href="/internal-revenue-code-complex/">allocable to a partner under IRC </a>§861 relies upon the determination of a partner’s interest in a partnership. Corporations owning 10% or more of a partnership must apply a special rule under that code section. Allocations of non-recourse debt are made in accordance with a partner’s interest in profits of the partnership. In a complex or tiered distribution arrangement, the answer may not be readily apparent. Attribution of corporate ownership through constructive ownership under §318 requires one to measure the partner’s interest in the partnership where applicable.

Perhaps the only point that is clear is that the Service will continue to be able to second guess taxpayers under a facts and circumstances test.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Microsoft is being audited by the IRS and they demand leaders testify</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/file00017538709291-300x225.jpg" alt="Microsoft is being audited by the IRS and they demand leaders testify" />The IRS is suing a number of former and current executives of Microsoft in a bid to force them to testify in an investigation into the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">company's corporate tax practices.</a>

According to The Seattle Times, at issue is whether the company is following corporate tax law in its practices of <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/irs-demands-ballmer-other-microsoft-leaders-testify-in-corporate-tax-audit-b99415138z1-286806621.html">transferring the rights</a> to its software to various subsidiaries in countries and territories of the U.S. with low taxes. This practice is commonly used by <a href="/white-house-budget-takes-276-billion-multinationals/">multinational corporations</a> with valuable intellectual properties, and reportedly had "billions of dollars of impact" on Microsoft's taxable income between 2004 and 2006, according to the lawsuit being brought by the IRS.

<strong>How it works</strong>
Companies that have subsidiaries in countries around the world are supposed to operate as though those subsidiaries were an "arm's length" away for tax purposes. This means negotiating and dealing fairly with each other instead of setting prices that are favorable to the company come tax time. Frequently, this is not what happens.

Picture a large, multinational company with Subsidiary A in a country or locale with low taxes but a small market for its intellectual goods. Subsidiary B is in a country with higher taxes but a much larger market. Subsidiary B makes $1 billion in profits, but to reduce the overall tax burden, the company shifts the rights to the intellectual goods to Subsidiary A and sets the "price" for Subsidiary B to sell those goods at $1 billion. The result is that Subsidiary B makes no profits on paper, meaning that it has to pay virtually nothing in corporate tax. Subsidiary A has $1 billion in profits and pays the lower taxes on those profits that are mandated by its location.

The Internal Revenue Service appears to believe that this is what is happening in the case of Microsoft, and is attempting to get to the bottom of the issue.

According to GeekWire, the IRS issued a summons to longtime <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/ceo-succession-planning-did-microsoft-get-it-right/">CEO Steve Ballmer </a>at his home in Seattle demanding that he testify on Dec. 8, but he <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/irs-fights-ballmer-ex-microsoft-execs-testimony-corporate-tax-probe/">failed to appear</a>. Microsoft had already told the IRS by this point that it was declining to make Ballmer and other former executives available because of a disagreement with the IRS over interview procedures. The IRS is also seeking to interview former chief Jim Allchin, former executive Bill Veghte, former Office division leader Jeff Raikes, former research and strategy chief Craig Mundie, former VP of Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Group Jon Roskill and former marketing chief Mich Matthews, among others.]]></content>

<h2>The bill was scheduled to take effect over the course of three years.</h2>
The news source continued, noting that if net general tax collections in the year ending June 30 exceed $20.2 billion, the rate could potentially come down even further, to 4 percent. If certain targets are met in the following year, they could fall to 3 percent. The state also cut the rate on individual income to 5.75 percent from the already lowered rate of 5.8 percent.

North Carolina broadened the sales tax base in order to account for lost revenues, most <a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/n-c-laws-brings-lower-taxes-but-fewer-breaks/article_3a97033d-ffc7-55db-ac40-3e33dbd33b0e.html">notably on entertainment</a>, according to the Fay Observer. These changes went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers also took away breaks to cab drivers and Hollywood studios shooting in the state.

In the past, taxi drivers were able to claim a quarterly refund on the gasoline excise tax - this will no longer be available, the news source reported. A 25 percent tax credit for TV and film production in the state is being allowed to expire in favor of a grant program being enacted in 2015. This 25 percent tax credit allowed producers to forego $61 million in state taxes in 2013, but such credits are also a major factor in determining where studios will cite their.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/estate-tax-figures.jpg" alt="Goodbye 2014! Hello 2015! Here's everything you need to know about the estate tax figures for this year." />As we ring in the new year, the federal estate tax is undergoing a few predictable changes. As an informed citizen arranging your affairs, it is important to stay on top of the relevant figures as they change or stay the same. To that end, the most important figures to know relating to the estate tax figures in 2015 are below.
<h3>The estate tax exclusion is going up</h3>
Because it was recently indexed for inflation, the federal estate tax exemption is going up. This means that the size that an estate will need to be in 2015 before it triggers the estate tax is now larger. In 2014, the exemption was $5.34 million per person. In 2015, that will go up by about $90,000 to $5.43 million per person.

Keep in mind that money is freely <a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/united-states-v-windsor-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-doma/">transferrable between you and your spouse if you are married.</a> This means that for a married couple, the estate tax exemption is actually going to be $10.86 million in 2015.
<h3>The annual gift exclusion is staying the same</h3>
The annual gift exclusion - that is, the amount that you can gift in cash or <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/commercial-property-alert-new-jersey-law-imposes-notification-requirements-for-rooftop-solar-panels/">property without tacking that amount onto the size of your taxable estate </a>- will remain at $14,000 for 2015. The annual gift exclusion is also indexed for inflation, but the figure is rounded to the nearest $1,000 increment. Because inflation was small enough that it didn't bump the annual gift exclusion into a new category, it will remain the same.

If your estate is large enough that you are likely to incur the<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/"> estate tax upon your death, it is important to begin planning now.</a> There are a number of means and strategy by which the size of an estate can be lowered while still directing your wealth toward the best interests of your loved ones.]]></content>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/State-Tax-Reform.jpg" alt="Changes are-a commin' when it comes to 2015 and its going to be big...especially for state tax reform." />This year could <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/29/2015-Will-Be-Landmark-Year-State-Tax-Reform">coincide with substantial state tax reform</a>, as many separate jurisdictions are currently planning changes in this area, policy analyst Jared Meyer wrote in The Fiscal Times.
<h2>Widespread state tax reform</h2>
Lawmakers in Nebraska, Georgia and Arkansas are all working on reforming <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax laws</a> in their respective states in 2015, noted Meyer, who works at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.

Legislators are pushing for these changes after 14 separate states <a href="http://www.alec.org/wp-content/uploads/2014-TaxCutRoundup.pdf">cut their taxes in 2014</a>, according to an American Legislative Exchange Council report. Wisconsin, Arizona, Rhode Island, Florida, Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio, Kansas, New York, Maryland, Nebraska, Michigan, Missouri and Minnesota brought about reform during the year.
<h2>Estate taxes</h2>
Last year, several states reduced the total estate taxes paid by their residents when they increased their exemption levels. Eliminating this burden can be particularly helpful, Meyer contended, as many households move to states that do not tax this transfer of wealth. If these individuals decide to relocate to another state, this will result in their new jurisdiction benefiting from the income tax revenue they produce.

The policy analyst cited the most recent figures available, which revealed that states that had an estate tax in 2013 suffered net outflows of adjusted gross income of $92.7 billion between 2000 and 2010. Rhode Island and New York both took steps to become more competitive last year when they reduced their estate tax burden.

Last year, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo approved the state budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year, which immediately <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/new-york-corporate-tax-overhaul-broadens-bases-lowers-rates-and-reduces-complexity">increased the Empire State's estate tax exemption to $2 million</a> from its previous level of $1 million. The change became effective April 1 of that year, and the legislation set forth a schedule whereby the exemption will increase over time until it matches the federal exemption by 2019.

Rhode Island implemented two separate measures surrounding its estate taxes, increasing its exemption to $1.5 million from $922,000 and changing up its policy so that only wealth above this limit is subject to tax.
<h2>Corporate income tax</h2>
Several states reduced their corporate income taxes in 2014, including New Mexico, North Carolina, New York and Rhode Island. The government officials of these jurisdictions implemented these new policies after businesses paid more than $53.3 in state and local corporate income taxes in fiscal year 2013, according to data provided by the Council on State Taxation.

Separate figures provided by the ALEC report supported the perception that by lowering these business taxes, government officials can help fuel more robust job growth. More specifically, the document revealed that while the eight states with the highest corporate income taxes experienced a cumulative job growth rate of 5.1 percent between 2003 to 2013, the eight states where companies paid the least in taxes saw their jobs expand at a rate of 12.1 percent.

Amid this progress, Meyer has asserted that reducing taxes has become an important consideration for many state governments. He predicted that as a result of this new attitude, government officials in these jurisdictions will continue to bring about a state tax reform.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/US-Corporate-Income-Tax.jpg" alt="US Corporate Income Tax...Should we take it or should we leave it?" />Many have given their input on why should maintain or eliminate the US corporate income tax, and market experts recently provided some compelling arguments on this topic.
<h3>Columnist makes case for eliminating the US corporate income tax</h3>
On Dec. 29, 2014, Wall Street Journal columnist John Steele Gordon <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/john-steele-gordon-top-10-reasons-to-abolish-the-corporate-income-tax-1419899269">laid out 10 separate reasons for eliminating this tax</a>. He delved into a brief history of the policy, noting that President William Howard Taft convinced Congress to include a tax on corporate profits in the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909. At the same time, Taft asked for a constitutional amendment to create a personal income tax.

The author contended that this approach constituted a plan to tax the rich, as they held almost all corporate stock at that point. While the corporate income tax was meant to exist only in the short-term, it ended up being permanent. In addition, the government implemented a personal income tax when it ratified the 16th amendment.

The creation of taxes on both corporate and personal income resulted in the policies surrounding these levies growing increasingly complex, as industry professionals generated solutions to make one type seem like the other, Gordon wrote. Because of this intricate system, the author has singled out greater simplicity as the number one reason to abolish the corporate income tax.

Gordon also argued that if the U.S. government eliminated the corporate income tax, $2 trillion that is currently held overseas would flow back to the world's largest economy. The companies benefiting from this windfall could potentially harness the funds to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/12/31/the-eleventh-and-most-important-reason-to-abolish-the-corporate-income-tax/">boost dividends or increase investment</a> in the nation, noted Forbes contributor Tim Worstall.

If these firms were able to repatriate their earnings and use it either as previously specified, this development would increase income tax revenue and bolster aggregate demand.

The author emphasized that eliminating the corporate income tax would push stock prices higher, which would also put upward pressure on consumer spending.
<h3>Counter-arguments for eliminating the US Corporate income tax</h3>
While the aforementioned arguments - which are only some of the reasons that Gordon has offered for eliminating the corporate income tax - may sound compelling, James Longstreet wrote in American Thinker that doing away with this duty would <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2014/12/no_rush_for_a_zero_corporate_tax.html">inadvertently create various consequences</a>.

He emphasized that a wide range of industries depend on their goods and services being tax deductible, and that many companies that thrive on the current complexity of the tax code could find themselves out of business.
<h3>Proposed alternative</h3>
Instead, Longstreet has proposed imposing a flat tax with phased-out deductions, expensing and depreciations. He emphasized that providing such a situation would deliver the simplicity that Gordon spoke to, but would not take a heavy toll on the tax industry. Finally, he noted that while creating a corporate income tax rate of zero would eliminate expending, depreciation and other writeoffs, a flat rate would create far fewer complications.

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The tides may be changing in regards to medical device tax in Obamacare...</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medical-device-tax.png" alt="The tides may be changing in regards to medical device tax in Obamacare" />On Jan. 7, a bipartisan group of lawmakers forecast the U.S. House of Representatives would finally succeed in its efforts to repeal the medical device tax component of Obamacare, after pushing this agenda for years.
<h3>New bill wins support of House</h3>
The latest legislation floated to repeal this provision, a bill that Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn. introduced Jan. 6, <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/228839-lawmakers-see-opening-on-medical-device-tax-repeal">has managed to secure the support</a> of most of the House's members, including Democrats, according to The Hill. This momentum has built up after Republicans contended for months that if they managed to win control of the legislature, eliminating this tax would be one of their primary objectives.
"Many of us were saying from the outset this is a very ill-conceived idea," Paulsen stated during a news conference Jan. 7, the media outlet reported. "You're going to have fewer start-ups, less ideas in the garage."
<h3>Previous initiatives</h3>
The congressman, who just began his fourth term in Congress, has repeatedly <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/01/paulsen-tries-again-to-repeal-medical-device-tax/">proposed bills that would eliminate this provision</a>, Washington Correspondent Brett Neely recently wrote in MPR News. While his legislation obtained the House's approval twice since 2012, the initiative tasted defeat upon reaching the Senate.
However, the situation may prove different this time, as the bill failed to pass the Senate when the legislative body was controlled by Democrats, Neely emphasized. His latest bill commands the support of 257 members of the House, and the Democrats who support the initiative have indicated they are behind the measure because they want to benefit medical device companies in their districts.

"Repealing this tax has strong bipartisan support across the political spectrum," he said at the conference Jan. 7, the author wrote. "We've been in the red zone before but now with new Senate leadership, we're confident we can get it across the goal line."
<h3>Tax revenue concerns</h3>
While Paulsen may be optimistic about the effort's prospects, supporting lawmakers could run into trouble if they are unable to find methods of offsetting the revenue lost by eliminating the tax, according to The Hill. The provision currently generates close to $30 billion over the course of 10 years.

However, Paulsen has indicated he isn't worried about that hurdle, and both he and Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis. have predicted that members of the House and Senate - Democrat and Republican alike - will find a way to cover the lost revenue, the media outlet reported. Paulsen emphasized that the House has done that before, approving legislation in 2012 that would have recovered subsidy overpayments from Obamacare and used that to pay for the income shortfall.

In the event that the legislature can come to an agreement, a final hurdle remains. Currently, it is unclear whether Pres. Barack Obama would veto the proposal should it come to his desk. Obama has previously threatened to veto the medical device tax repeal, The Hill noted.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Pres. Barack Obama proposed a new tax on financial institutions during his State of the Union Address earlier in January.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/new-tax.gif" alt="Pres. Barack Obama proposed a new tax on financial institutions during his State of the Union Address earlier in January." />The new tax policy, which would levy a seven-point basis fee on the total liabilities of roughly 100 financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets, would <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-18/obama-tries-tax-cuts-on-rich-again-offset-by-new-breaks">generate an estimated $110 billion in tax revenue</a> over the course of 10 years, according to Bloomberg.
<h2>Broader approach</h2>
While the president suggested a similar tax in the past, the new policy would affect a broader array of financial institutions such as insurance companies and asset managers, a senior administration official told the news source. Because of this more expansive tax base, the new proposal would raise around twice as much money while at the same time imposing a lower rate on industry participants.

The financial institutions that would need to pay this new tax fall under the description of "too big too fail," meaning that their vast size provides them with both lower borrowing costs and also insurance that they will receive bailout money if needed, since their dissolution could help <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/01/25/how-president-obama-can-get-his-big-bank-tax-without-congress/">trigger the financial system's collapse</a>, noted Forbes contributor Tim Worstall.

While their key role ensures these financial institutions receive protection from the federal government, these companies are not actively paying for their insurance, stated Worstall, who currently serves as a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute and has published in a wide range of venues.
<h2>Managing risk</h2>
While the average taxpayer might feel comfort that the largest U.S. banks are insulated from failing completely, they might not be so enthused if they need to foot the bill. This taxpayer might be happy to know that many predict the new policy could <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/20/investing/obama-bank-tax-state-of-the-union/">give major banks less incentive to take big risks</a>, CNNMoney reported.

The White House has stated that the proposed tax would "make it more costly for the largest financial firms to finance their activities by borrowing heavily," according to the news source. However, there are some fine points that need to be clarified. While the proposal stated it would affect liabilities, simply targeting all liabilities could prompt banks to originate fewer loans.
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
Obama has indicated that if he succeeded in obtaining the tax revenue from this proposal, he would use the money to expand tax benefits that would affect the middle class, including credits for child care and higher education, Bloomberg reported. These efforts dovetail with his recently announced plans to work with Congress to provide community college education free to millions of students.

"What you're seeing here is really dedicated middle-class tax relief to really get at that problem of middle-class wage stagnation," stated Harry Stein, who works with the Center for American Progress as the director of fiscal policy, according to the news source.]]></content>

Barack Obama unveiled his latest tax proposal during the recent State of the Union Address, financial services industry participants, republican lawmakers and top lobbyist on Wall Street have all voiced their criticisms of the would-be policy." />The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association contended that the new tax, which would place a seven-basis point levy on the liabilities of the largest banks, insurance firms and investment management companies in the U.S and Wall Street., is a superfluous attempt to manage industry risk and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-19/obama-s-110-billion-bank-tax-would-hurt-economy-sifma-says">could undermine lending</a>, according to Bloomberg.

Obama announced this new plan in his most recent SOTU address after floating a similar proposal last year, when he suggested imposing a tax on the liabilities of banks holding $50 billion in assets, the media outlet reported. The new plan, which would generate tax revenue that is estimated to be twice as high, would extend to asset managers and insurance firms and provide a lower tax rate than the original proposal.

SIFMA president and CEO Kenneth Bentsen <a href="http://www.sifma.org/newsroom/2015/sifma_statement_on_bank_tax_in_white_house_proposal/">weighed in on the policy</a> in a statement released Jan. 18.
<h2>'Unintended consequences'</h2>
"Tax rules are often blunt instruments, and the tax code is not the place for a broad, new and duplicative financial regulatory regime," he said. "This $110 billion targeted tax increase on America's most productive financial institutions could have far-reaching unintended consequences that will curtail economic growth and job creation while negatively impacting the allocation of credit and the provision of financial services to individuals and institutions."‎ ‎

He was not the only industry representative who spoke out against the proposal, as James Ballentine, chief lobbyist at trade organization the American Bankers Association, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102348303">emphasized the challenges</a> the new tax could create for the financial services industry, according to The Financial Times.
<h2>'Difficult time'</h2>
"This really comes at a difficult time for an industry that is moving the economy forward," he said, the media outlet reported. "To impose a fee, a flat tax, is certainly not warranted, and I hope Congress will reject this idea."

Bentson also asserted that the proposed change was coming at a bad time and that it appeared oblivious to all the changes that lawmakers and regulators have made since 2009, according to Bloomberg. While he emphasized that government officials have been working on changing the regulatory environment for years, democrats in congress have been playing tug of war with industry as its representatives make an effort to take the bite out of the Dodd-Frank Act.

These struggles could experience key shifts after the republicans managed to enjoy key victories in both the House and Senate. These conservative lawmakers are not likely to approve another tax hike, as they have argued that such efforts hold back economic growth, according to The Financial Times.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Pres. Barack Obama recently proposed a new estate tax policy that could have a substantial impact on what Americans can leave for their heirs.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/new-estate-tax-policy.gif" alt="Pres. Barack Obama recently proposed a new estate tax policy that could have a substantial impact on what Americans can leave for their heirs." />The president plans to outline the details of the new estate tax policy in his budget plan on Feb. 2, according to Bloomberg. Obama is suggesting that upon death, the federal government levy a capital gains tax - with the top rate being 28 percent instead of the current 23.8 percent - on the amount by which assets have appreciated since they were purchased, according to Bloomberg News.

It is worth noting that this approach would affect both the ultra wealthy and also everyday individuals who would otherwise not have enough assets to face any estate tax liability, the media outlet reported. In addition, the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">new policy would tax a person's assets </a>whether they were sold or not. If a family bought a home that surged 200 percent in value and then the heir inherited the property, the inheritor would be responsible for the taxes.

The new estate tax policy would provide a $200,000 exemption for heirs and a $500,000 exemption for homes, according to the news source. What this means is that if a married couple paid $500,000 for a home that was later worth $1.5 million, the capital gains burden would affect the $500,000 tax base.
<h2>Potential revenue boost</h2>
Obama's proposal might provide the federal government with a significant revenue boost, as the estate tax brought in roughly $12.7 billion during fiscal year 2013, approximately half the amount generated before lawmakers passed estate tax cuts in 2001, tax expert Beth Kaufman stated Jan. 20, according to Bloomberg BNA. Between 2001 and 2012, estate and gift taxes saw their top marginal rate decline to 40 percent from 55 percent and their exemptions rise $1 million to the current $5.43 million. Kaufman, a former Treasury Department associate tax legislative counsel, emphasized that these two policies generate substantially less than 1 percent of all tax revenue, and the number of taxable returns fell to fewer than 5,000 in fiscal year 2013, which represents 0.2 percent of the people who passed away in that period.
<h2>Impact on families</h2>
While the estate tax may not be a huge portion of total revenue, it has the potential to have a substantial impact on families, according to Bloomberg News. "We have a lot of families that own a specific stock, and they've owned that forever, and they do not want to get rid of it," Katherine Dean, managing director of wealth planning at Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Francisco, told the media outlet. "This will have a huge impact on them. Huge."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>In his latest federal budget proposal, Pres. Barack Obama suggested tax on foreign earnings held overseas. By doing so, he would seek to free up revenue that could then be invested into improving the nation's transportation infrastructure.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tax-On-Foreign-Earnings.gif" alt="In his latest federal budget proposal, Pres. Barack Obama suggested tax on foreign earnings held overseas. By doing so, he would seek to free up revenue that could then be invested into improving the nation's transportation infrastructure." />He presented this idea at a time when major U.S.-based companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Pfizer have built up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of unrepatriated earnings with the intention of transferring it back to the U.S. at a lower tax rate, The New York Times reported.
Because they would need to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">pay this bill to bring the earnings back home</a>, many of these companies are holding them in foreign nations and reinvesting the profits there, even if doing so results in them generating less of a return before taxes, according to the news source.
<h2>Tax on foreign earnings</h2>
Amid this situation, Obama has proposed levying a one-time assessment of 14 percent on profits held overseas, the media outlet reported. This levy, which would have a tax base of roughly $2 trillion in unrepatriated earnings, would go toward restoring the Highway Trust Fund and funding infrastructure projects. This policy would generate around $248 billion in revenue over the next five years, the president has asserted.
In addition, Obama wants to introduce a separate tax that would obligate companies based in the U.S. to pay a minimum rate of 19 percent on all new earnings, while receiving a credit for any foreign taxes paid, according to FoxNews.com.
<h2>Corporate tax rates</h2>
The president's proposal would also cut the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">corporate tax rate on profits generated </a>in the U.S. to 28 percent, the media outlet reported. The current top rate, 35 percent, is the highest for any of the major economies. This figure dissuades many companies from moving their earnings back to America, and they instead retain these profits overseas.

Currently, most republican lawmakers - and also U.S. companies - would like to have a so-called territorial system, whereby businesses only pay tax on income generated within a nation's borders, according to the news source. Most developed countries already use this approach.
<h2>Business groups critical</h2>
While some may be warming to this proposal, many organizations representing businesses quickly expressed their disapproval, Bloomberg reported. The National Association of Manufacturers, The Business Roundtable and targeted coalitions of companies are all contending the proposal would harm companies based in the U.S. Further, some have warned that implementing the new tax policies could make it easier for foreign companies to buy American firms.

"The litany of new taxes placed on globally engaged, U.S. companies is at best a short-sighted attempt to raise government revenues, and at worst a misguided policy that doesn't recognize America's role in the 21st century economy," the LIFT America Coalition, which counts major companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Cisco Systems Inc. among its members, said in a statement, the media outlet reported.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Investors <a href="http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=684652">can benefit significantly</a> from staying up to date on corporate tax reform developments, as existing policy may have a substantial impact on the stocks of different companies, financial expert Scott Cooley wrote in a recent Morningstar article.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tax-Reform-Developments.jpg" alt="Investors can benefit significantly from staying up to date on corporate tax reform developments, as existing policy may have a substantial impact on the stocks of different companies, financial expert Scott Cooley wrote in a recent Morningstar article." />

This point could be particularly helpful, as discussions involving corporate income tax reform have generated visibility in Congress.

<h2>Reform and investing</h2>
Cooley, who is the director of policy research for Morningstar, emphasized that if the federal government ends up approving any proposed changes to the corporate tax structure, this development could easily have a major effect on the <a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/sec-proposes-new-hedging-policy/">financial state of companies.</a>

While lawmakers may encounter challenges reaching a consensus on many different issues, the push for corporate tax reform has generated bipartisan support, he noted. Should lawmakers succeed in their efforts to change policy, the broader asset markets will respond far in advance of the approved legislation being enacted.
<h2>Obama tax proposal</h2>
With this in mind, market participants might benefit from perusing any progress that is made on Pres. Barack Obama's proposal to tax foreign earnings. In his State of the Union Address, Obama suggested providing a one-time, 14 percent levy on these profits held overseas.

Under current tax law, these companies only need to pay a tax if they opt to bring these financial resources back to the U.S. Given this setup, many firms simply keep their earnings in foreign countries instead of repatriating them back to the world's largest economy, where they could face a tax rate of up to 35 percent.

As part of this broader plan, Obama would reduce the top corporate tax rate for profits generated in the U.S. to 28 percent.
<h2>Complicated policy</h2>
While the current tax rate may seem high, Cooley points out that the effective tax rate is significantly lower. Since U.S. companies face such high corporate income taxes - which can reach 40 percent of income after state taxes are included - these firms have responded by lobbying for different tax breaks that reduce their effective rates.

Many of these efforts have succeeded, and as a result, the framework of tax breaks and subsidies has grown very complex, he emphasized. In addition, the situation has left the U.S. with one of the biggest differences between actual corporate taxes brought in and the stated rate. Because of this lopsided situation, companies have even greater motivation to hire lobbyists to advocate for special tax breaks.

Given the intricate nature of this situation, many have advocated creating a simpler tax code. For example, lawmakers could make the current foreign earnings more straightforward by using a "territorial" system, which involves individual nations only <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/02/in-new-budget-obama-to-proposed-14-percent-tax-on-overseas-corporate-profits-to/">taxing companies</a> for the income generated within their borders, according to FoxNews.com.
<h2>Simpler approaches</h2>
Currently, this approach has garnered the support of both republican lawmakers and most companies, the media outlet reported. However, Cooley emphasizes that implementing more simplistic tax policies can be challenging.

For example, changing the complex system of U.S. corporate tax breaks could have major implications for these firms, he noted. While Wal-Mart generates most of its revenue domestically and harnesses a small number of actions that generate tax advantages, Johnson &amp; Johnson creates a strong portion of its <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/frank-l-brunetti/">revenue in overseas countries.</a>

While investors might currently look at the cash flow and price-to-earnings ratios of these companies when determining what to buy, they should keep in mind that these hard numbers may depend on a system of complex tax policies that could soon change.

Even though it is impossible to predict what direction tax reform will take, Cooley wagers that lawmakers will put some effort into changing existing policies in the next few years.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Corporate tax policy should emphasize providing companies with proper incentives so they can focus on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/upshot/corporate-tax-reform-focusing-on-where-the-money-is-not-where-the-jobs-are.html?_r=1&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0">earning the highest pretax profits,</a></h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Corporate-Tax-Policy-Discussion.jpg" alt="Corporate-Tax-Policy" />instead of producing the greatest after-tax profits, Josh Barro recently wrote in The New York Times.
<h2>Corporate hiring decisions</h2>
Barro, a NYT correspondent and former senior fellow for the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, bemoaned the current emphasis that much of the current discourse places on policies that could motivate companies to move jobs overseas, noting that businesses make decisions on where to hire based on a wide range of variables.

"Employment is a macro issue; it's not an issue of which particular company is investing where," said Eric Toder, an institute fellow for Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Urban Institute and co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, Barro noted. Foreign businesses' investments in U.S. factories will probably make up for any incentive current fiscal policies give domestic companies to build manufacturing facilities overseas.
<h2>Global job creation</h2>
There is certainly evidence to support his point of view. While U.S. companies did move production overseas during the jobless recovery, foreign businesses also hired workers in the United States. For example, many major pharmaceutical companies - including Merck and Sanofi - are headquartered in other countries, and have hired research and development staff domestically.

Siemens has repeatedly earned the recognition of Pres​. Barack Obama for the investments it has made in the U.S., even though the company is "shipping jobs overseas" every time it provides capital for operations in the world's largest economy, Barro emphasized. Since companies based both here and abroad are creating domestic and foreign employment, the corporate tax policy conversations are starting to stress revenue instead of jobs.
<h2>Obama's tax on foreign earnings</h2>
This new focus was evident in Obama's latest corporate tax policy proposals, which he unveiled at the State of the Union address in January. During the speech, he stated his desire to tax earnings held overseas at an instant, one-time rate of 19 percent.

Currently, companies are required to pay taxes on these profits when they are repatriated, but have the ability to hold them in foreign nations indefinitely. Under Obama's proposal, domestic businesses with foreign operations would face the one-time levy on these unrepatriated earnings, but would in turn receive a tax credit worth 85 percent of the taxes paid to the overseas countries where they do business.
<h2>Territorial taxation</h2>
To simplify, companies would pay taxes in the nations where they generate income in the first place. As long as the country is not a tax haven, these businesses would not have an obligation to pay anything more to the U.S. government, Barro emphasized. This would be the case even if the foreign jurisdiction has a moderately lower tax rate than the U.S.

Members of both political parties back such territorial taxation, and the approach's bipartisan support is notable, Barro emphasized.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>In January, Massachusetts Lawmaker, Shawn Dooley proposed cutting estate taxes in the Bay State in an attempt to prevent elderly citizens from moving to other states.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Massachusetts-Lawmaker.jpg" alt="In January, Massachusetts Lawmaker, Shawn Dooley proposed cutting estate taxes in the Bay State in an attempt to prevent elderly citizens from moving to other states." />The Massachusetts Lawmaker revealed that if an estate is worth more than $1 million, the state <a href="http://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/attleboro-area-state-rep-proposes-cut-in-mass-estate-tax/article_5d2893b4-9b65-11e4-94fb-57dac398a76d.html">levies taxes between 8 and 14 percent</a> of that value, The Sun Chronicle reported. In order to retain a greater number of seniors - and also their assets - he is proposing increasing the exemption to $2.6 million, which would be 50 percent of the $5.2 million federal exemption.

As time goes on, he would use this formula - along with inflation indexes - to determine the exemption amount, according to the news source. The lawmaker has said that while his proposal would result in the state losing between $10 million and $15 million every year, very wealthy taxpayers are already circumventing this particular burden.

Ideally, he would eliminate the Massachusetts estate tax completely, but is aware that the state's legislature would never approve such a motion, the media outlet reported. Currently, only 12 states have this particular revenue source.

<strong>Widespread estate tax reform</strong>
Massachusetts is not alone in thinking that <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">estate tax reform could help</a> it retain its citizens, as New York State previously <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2015/01/05/new-yorks-state-tax-reform-much-ado-about-nothing/">increased its estate tax exemption to $5 million</a> from $1 million, Steve Forbes noted in a Forbes article. However, this policy has an interesting caveat. If the estate is valued at more than $5 million, the tax is applied to the entire amount.

This policy could deter small business owners from remaining in the state, Forbes emphasized. This development could impact job creation, creating adverse consequences for the economy.

New York <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/29/2015-Will-Be-Landmark-Year-State-Tax-Reform">increased this exemption last year</a>, along with Minnesota, Rhode Island and Maryland, policy analyst Jared Meyer noted in The Fiscal Times. Many states have been changing their policies because of the resources that individuals invest into lowering their estate tax burdens, emphasized Meyer, who works at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.

<strong>Mass. Tax policy considerations</strong>
Amid these trends, Noah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, told The Sun Chronicle that lowering estate taxes is not an urgent matter on Beacon Hill. To reduce the burden, state officials would have to decrease revenue that could go toward funding education and local aid.

However, State Rep. Jay Kaufman, chairman of the House Joint Committee on Revenue, has stated that the proposal is worth considering, the media outlet reported.

"Representative Dooley's bill has merit as it encourages us to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/james-f-mcdonough/">examine and consider some interesting potential changes we should consider to our tax code</a>," Kaufman said in a statement, according to the news source. "The bill raises some very important questions, and should generate a thoughtful analysis and healthy debate on its merits. That's how democracy is supposed to work. I look forward to the analysis and debate that will follow."]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">A key committee in the Florida senate recently backed legislation that would allow roughly 2,000 small businesses to avoid paying the Sunshine State's corporate income tax.</h2><br>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/florida-senate.gif" alt="A key committee in the Florida senate recently backed legislation that would allow roughly 2,000 small businesses to avoid paying the Sunshine State's corporate income tax." />The News Service of Florida reported Feb. 3 that after reviewing Gov. Rick Scott's proposed tax cuts for the coming fiscal year - which would be worth $673 million - the Finance and Tax Committee unanimously <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/blog/morning-edition/2015/02/senate-backs-gov-rick-scotts-tax-cuts-for-families.html?page=all">supported a proposal</a>, HB 138, which would raise the amount of corporate income that is exempt from state taxes.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Corporate income tax policy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sen. Dorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, the chair of this committee, proposed the new policy, which would allow companies to generate up to $75,000 in income per year without<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/"> paying corporate income tax at the state level</a>, according to the news source. This figure would compare to the current level of $50,000, according to the media outlet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The proposal also <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/lake/os-lk-corporate-tax-rate-hukill-20150131-story.html">obtained the approval</a> of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee, which recently voted 10-to-1 in favor of the measure, News Service of Florida reported. The only lawmaker who opposed the measure was Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, who stated at the time that he prefers <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">tax cuts that affect individuals </a>and the middle class.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Industry backing</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to receiving broad support in both of these committees, the proposal won the backing of both the National Federation of Independent Business and the Florida Chamber of Commerce, according to the media outlet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With all this momentum, Hukill has stated she is more confident about her proposal's prospects this year after lawmakers left it out of the final tax - and fee-cut package they finalized last year, the media outlet reported.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The assumption is that if corporations pay less to government in taxes they will spend more on capital and salaries and it will help job creation," <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/02/scotts-tax-cut-proposal-gets-key-support-in-senate.html">she stated earlier this month</a> when explaining the main draw of her proposal, according to Miami Herald Blog.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Abolishing corporate income tax</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, Hukill's proposal would cost Florida approximately $7.6 million in tax revenue in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, and $18.7 during 2016-2017, the media outlet reported. Even with this loss of income, the current plan involves gradually eliminating the Sunshine State's income tax over time. Florida imposed this burden in 1972, levying a 5 percent rate, before increasing this amount to 5.5 percent in 1984.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One lawmaker who would like to see the state's corporate income tax eliminated over time is Sen. Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, according to The News Service of Florida. Lawmakers increased the exemption to $50,000 in 2012 from the prior level of $25,000. As a result, 3,770 companies were free of income taxes. Prior to this move, in 2011, the state increased the level to $25,000 from $5,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the state certainly seems to be moving toward abolishing its corporate income tax, one lawmaker has called for more careful analysis, the media outlet reported. Government officials should ask Florida's top economists to evaluate the varying proposals, insisted Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Pres. Barack Obama proposed a major overhaul of federal estate tax policy during his State of the Union address.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/federal-estate-tax.gif" alt="Pres. Barack Obama proposed a major overhaul of federal estate tax policy during his State of the Union address." />These measures could have significant implications for a wide range of Americans, including the wealthy and those who inherit valuable items such as businesses.
<h2>Proposed change in basis</h2>
Existing policy uses the higher of the deceased's original basis or the fair market value at the time of death to determine the tax basis of the inheritor. In almost all cases, the estate's fair market value when the decedent passes away is the larger of the two.

However, Obama is proposing <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/inheriting-grandma-s-house-comes-with-tax-bill-under-obama-plan">levying a capital gains tax</a> on how much the deceased's assets have risen in value from the time the owner bought them, according to Bloomberg. Under this scheme, a stock portfolio that surged from a purchase price of $200,000 to $800,000 at the time of death would be subject to taxes even if it was not sold.
<h2>High tax burden</h2>
The proposal would also increase the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent from its current level of 23.8 percent, the media outlet reported. As a result, the U.S. estate tax rate <a href="http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-brain-trust/013015-737288-obama-proposes-highest-estate-tax-rate-in-world.htm">could be one of the highest</a> of any industrialized economy, Stephen Moore, chief economist of the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a recent Investor's Business Daily op-ed.

He cited an estimate provided by Dick Patten, chairman of the American Business Defense Council, that the effective death tax rate would total 57 percent. After adding in state levies, the rate could reach as much as 68 percent. The average burden would be slightly less, coming in at 65 percent.

Moore cites Ernst &amp; Young figures indicating that only 1 in 38 industrialized nations monitored by the company - Belgium - has a higher death tax rate, which currently stands at 80 percent. However, Belgians inheriting wealth from an immediate family member would pay a rate of 60 percent.
<h2>Small business challenges</h2>
In the U.S., the situation is different, as an entrepreneur could increase the value of their business over time, pass it down to a member of their immediate family and end up <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/02/03/obamas-proposed-68-death-tax-would-be-highest-in-world/">generating both estate and income taxes</a>, Robert Wood, a tax lawyer based in San Francisco, wrote in a Forbes article.

This situation could create challenges for many, as small businesses already face difficulty when important members pass away, he emphasized. In these cases, simply staying in business can be a chore, and some companies will have to sell because of tax burdens.

While many are worried about how fledgling firms would fare under the proposed policies, some have pointed to other concerns, according to Bloomberg. Katherine Dean, who works for Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Francisco as a managing director of wealth planning, noted how the change would affect stockholders.

"We have a lot of families that own a specific stock, and they've owned that forever, and they do not want to get rid of it," Dean told the news source. "This will have a huge impact on them. Huge."
<h2>Simplifying the tax code</h2>
While many industry participants have criticized Obama's proposal, he has promoted it as a way to make policy more equitable and straightforward, wrote Wood. Currently, assets are stepped up to market value for income tax purposes, as failing to do so could result in heirs paying both income and estate taxes on the same assets or estates.

Obama also points to the federal government's combined exemption for estate and gift taxes, which stands at $5.43 million, Wood noted.

At any rate, many will likely tune in to this legislative proposal's developments as it makes its way through the republican-led Congress.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Worried about estate taxes? If you want to generate the lowest burden possible, follow some basic steps to ensure the proper way of minimizing estate taxes</h2>
<h3><strong><a href="top-steps-for-minimizing-estate-taxes"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/minimizing-estate-taxes.gif" alt="Worried about estate taxes? If you want to generate the lowest burden possible, follow some basic steps to ensure the proper way of minimizing estate taxes" width="500" height="500" /></a></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>1) Planning is crucial:</strong></h3>
First and foremost when it comes to minimizing estate taxes, keep in mind that a failure to plan is a plan for failure. While many believe they do not need to take crucial action simply because they do not meet the federal exclusion amount, which is $5.43 million in 2015, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/01/06/estate-planning-is-about-more-than-estate-taxes/">this perception is simply not true</a>, personal finance expert Mike Piper wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal.
<h3><strong>2) Conduct an inventory of items:</strong></h3>
Creating an inventory of valuable items can make it far easier to determine where they should go is another great way of minimizing estate taxes. Another good way to start is to simply go through your home and tally all objects worth $100 or more. For example, you might want to include items such as televisions, computers or vehicles. Aside from monetary worth, there is also sentimental value, and specific items mean a lot to people.

After compiling a list of physical items, move on to intangibles. For example, you could include any money you have in your bank account, 401(k) plan and brokerage account. In addition, covering any insurance policies - whether those are for life, long-term care or health - is important.
<h3><strong>3) Create a will:</strong></h3>
Once you have determined your items of value, create a will to ensure assets are divided in the manner you see fit. Be sure to develop one of these documents and ensure it is up-to-date. If you have children who are minors, having a will becomes even more important, because it will name their guardians. In addition, passing away without having a will can deprive heirs of the assets they would receive.
<h3><strong>4) Look into trusts:</strong></h3>
While you may not need a trust to achieve your goals, exploring these legal mechanisms certainly can't hurt. Some believe that trusts exist only for the wealthy, but this is a common misconception.

By establishing one, you can potentially enjoy many benefits, for example passing on resources without having to go through probate court. Some of these legal mechanisms will also protect your resources from lawsuits and creditors.
<h3><strong>5) Select an estate administrator:</strong></h3>
When picking out an estate administrator, be sure to select an individual who enjoys sound mental health and would be responsible. Before determining who will fill this role, it is important to consider different prospects, and also how your death could affect their emotions.

In addition, be sure to avoid automatically assuming your spouse should have this particular responsibility. While you do need to have the proper plan in place to minimize estate taxes, all of this will go to waste without the right administrator.
<h3><strong>6) Review your estate plans with your heirs:</strong></h3>
Once you have determined your estate plan and selected an administrator, be sure to go over the details with your heirs. Doing so can help eliminate problems such as confusion and also legal disputes.

Heirs <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/12/18/the-dangers-of-making-assumptions-about-inheritances/">frequently harbor misperceptions</a> about how much money their parents have, Piper wrote in a separate Wall Street Journal article. He specifically noted two instances where this understanding could break down:
<ul>
<li>The parents have less money than their inheritors think.</li>
<li>The heirs believe they will end up with a larger portion of the inheritance than they actually do.</li>
</ul>
To minimize estate taxes, be sure to conduct the proper due diligence. In addition, working with the right professionals can make a huge difference. Unless you have the proper training to do all this yourself, be sure to hire a good <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">estate planning attorney and possibly a financial advisor.</a>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>New Jersey estate taxes may see cuts in the upcoming year. Currently, the Garden State is 1 of 2 states that taxes both the estate of the deceased and also its heirs.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/new-jersey-estate-tax.gif" alt="At a time when many states have been cutting their estate tax, New Jersey estate taxes may also see . Currently, the Garden State is 1 of 2 states that taxes both the estate of the deceased and also its heirs." />As a result of this policy of double taxation, New Jersey's tax treatment of those who pass away has <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/02/should_nj_trade_a_higher_gas_tax_for_a_lower_death.html">generated substantial visibility</a>, according to NJ.com.
<h2>New Jersey Estate tax policy</h2>
While New Jersey levies both an estate tax and an inheritance task, its estate tax exclusion is also the least of any state in the U.S. at $675,000. This figure compares to the federal exemption, which rose to $5.43 million in 2015.

In addition, New Jersey counts real estate, cash, life insurance benefits, retirement accounts and other assets when <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/10/lawmakers-hope-to-bury-death-tax-in-nj/23194471/">determining the value of one's estate</a>, according to The Asbury Park Press NJ.

The inheritance tax applies to any transfers to the decedent's siblings - or their children's spouses - that are worth $25,000 or more, the media outlet reported. In addition, the levy, which has a rate between 11 and 16 percent, applies to any transfers of $500 or more to friends or other relatives.
<h2>Taxpayer challenges</h2>
Industry participants and policy analysts have brought up multiple challenges that stem from New Jersey's current treatment of its residents' estates. Currently, the Garden State's low estate tax exclusion results in the jurisdiction exempting the lowest number of taxpayers from facing this burden, according to The Asbury Park Press NJ.

Because the exemption is so low, many consider the estate tax an afterthought and are surprised when they have to pay it, Tedd Vitale, a certified public accountant in Spring Lake Heights, told the news source.

Those who oppose the current estate tax policy emphasize that because the state's average home value is $296,000, having one's estate reach a value of $675,000 is not a difficult task, according to NJ.com. Gov. Chris Christie emphasized how this policy affects middle-class families.

"For people who own a house in New Jersey, if they just own their house free and clear and have a little bit of retirement income leftover - and remember what happens here, once you get to $675,000 and $1, the tax isn't on the $1. It's on the $675," Christie said. "This affects most middle class families in New Jersey who own their own home."
<h2>Proposed reform</h2>
Amid this situation, lawmakers have floated several different proposals that would change how the state treats estate taxes, according to The Asbury Park Press NJ. One state lawmaker who supports the change is state Sen. Steven Oroho, (R-Sussex, Warren, Morris), a certified financial planner.

"It actually chases income out of the state of New Jersey," Oroho told the news source. "Quite frankly, people know right away, financial planners and estate attorneys, they almost feel like they have a duty to tell their clients: Here's what it costs in New Jersey, and here's what it costs elsewhere."
<h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
As New Jersey state lawmakers consider where they will get the money to pay for any change in estate tax policy, many are considering hiking the gas tax, according to NJ.com. Currently, the Garden State has the second-lowest gasoline tax in the nation, totalling 14.5 cents per gallon.

Lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum will have to work together if they want to hike the gasoline tax, State Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson) told the news source.

If New Jersey officials do find a way to change estate tax policy, such a move could have a major impact on residents of the Gardent State, as many are moving to other states to retire because "they simply can't afford to die here," Assemblyman Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) told the media outlet.]]></content>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Roundtable.gif" alt="The Business Roundtable recently urged a reform of federal corporate tax policy, and John Engler, president of the industry representative, presented this view to Washington lawmakers on March 11." />During a Senate hearing about balancing the federal budget, Engler, a former governor of Michigan, <a href="http://www.budget.senate.gov/republican/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=3b330fba-4389-4025-b44f-c4370e8ba50f">emphasized the importance of pro-growth policies</a>.
<h2>Corporate Tax Policy</h2>
The former governor warned that if the federal government keeps generating deficits, such a situation will have an adverse impact on economic conditions. With this concern in mind, he pointed out flaws he perceives in the current corporate tax policy and offered some solutions.

Engler specifically stated that U.S. companies have a harder time expanding in the global economy because of the nation's corporate tax system, and that this situation undermines the labor market, wages and investment in the world's largest economy.
<h2>Foreign M&amp;A</h2>
In addition, U.S. tax policy prompted a large number of foreign companies <a href="http://businessroundtable.org/media/news-releases/report-shows-uncompetitive-tax-code-contributing-foreign-acquisitions-us">to purchase American businesses</a>, according to a study released by the Business Roundtable March 10. This research, conducted by EY, evaluated more than 25,000 cross-border merger and acquisitions.

The accounting firm compared the differing outcomes of using the corporate income tax rates that existed between 2003 and 2013 and a rate of 25 percent, the average of The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.
<h2>M&amp;A trends</h2>
The research found that if the U.S. tax code had used the lower rate during this period, U.S. companies <a href="http://brt.org/resources/buying-and-selling-cross-border-mergers-and-acquisitions-and-us-corporate-income-tax">would have purchased $590 billion in cross-border assets</a> as opposed to losing $179 billion worth of these assets.

The difference between the two figures is $769 billion, which represents the amount of assets American businesses have lost because of the tax policy used at the time. In addition, the report estimates that if the nation had used a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, doing so would have resulted in 1,300 companies remaining in the U.S. during the last 10 years.

Amid all these figures, Engler lamented the outflow of key resources he believes have stemmed from current income tax treatment of companies based in the world's largest economy. As a result of these policies, the U.S. has become "a net exporter of headquarters, valuable assets and startup technologies," he said in a statement released along with the results of the EY study. "We've got to reverse this trend."
<h2>Engler's proposal</h2>
To fix the situation, Engler suggested taking two key steps. For starters, he proposed lowering the corporate income tax rate at 25 percent, which he contended would be more competitive than the current policy.

Secondly, he suggested adopting a "territorial" system of taxation, which would stop penalizing the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. once and for all. In addition, this proposed system would eliminate any taxation of the active foreign earnings of American companies over and above the foreign taxes paid.

By doing so, Engler contended the U.S. federal government would align its tax policy with that of its largest trading partners.
<h2>Experts weigh in</h2>
While Engel has claimed that existing corporate income tax policy is undermining U.S. business conditions, some experts contend the accounting firm's analysis <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/03/11/u-s-tax-system-encourages-foreign-takeovers-business-roundtable-study-says/">oversimplifies the situation</a>, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to these pundits, the impact that such policies have on U.S. companies is uncertain.

A perfect example of how the tax code can encourage American companies to buy foreign firms is the current treatment of repatriated earnings, according to the news source. Under existing policy, firms need to pay income taxes on any earnings they produce overseas and then bring back home. As a result, companies can either leave these resources overseas or use them to purchase companies based in foreign nations.
<h2>Impact of US dollar</h2>
Another variable that could have easily affected M&amp;A over the last decade or so is fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. While the U.S. dollar has made a strong recovery over the last year, it was trading lower against many other currencies for a large majority of the last 10 years.

Many foreign companies took advantage of the weaker dollar, using it to take advantage of cheaper deals on American companies. This development spurred some robust M&amp;A activity for firms based overseas.

While the statements that Engler made before Washington lawmakers - and EY figures he cited - may combine to create what looks like a compelling case, the actual situation may be far more complicated.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Reducing corporate income tax rate would <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/cut-corporate-tax-rate-would-provide-significant-boost-economy">bolster growth in the world's largest economy</a>, and the larger tax base would make any revenue loss minimal in the long run, The Tax Foundation stated recently.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reducing-Corporate-Income-Tax.gif" alt="Reducing corporate income tax rate would bolster growth in the world's largest economy, and the larger tax base would make any revenue loss minimal in the long run, The Tax Foundation stated recently." />The nonpartisan think tank is certainly not alone in supporting this reducing corporate income tax rate, as many experts have called for such a change.
<h2>Obama proposal</h2>
The Tax Foundation touted the benefits of lowering the corporate income tax rate shortly after Pres. Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/reform/tax-reform">proposed an overhaul of corporate tax policy</a>. During his State of the Union speech earlier this year, Obama outlined his plan, which would involve closing loopholes in exchange for reducing the top corporate income tax rate to 28 percent from its existing level of 35 percent.

Currently, the U.S. has the highest top corporate income tax rate of any major economy in the world. To pay for this reduction in the top rate, the proposal would eliminate many specific breaks that make it so companies in different industries can skirt taxes.
<h2>Creating an even playing field</h2>
When the Obama Administration announced the proposal, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner <a href="http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-obamas-corporate-tax-plan-a-good-idea">elaborated on the policy's intended outcome</a>, according to U.S. News and World Report.

"We want to restore a system in which American businesses succeed or fail based on the products they make and the services they provide, not on the creativity of their tax engineers or the lobbyists they hire," he stated, the media outlet reported.
<h2>Eliminating corporate income tax</h2>
Obama's proposal has certainly drawn its supporters, who contend reducing the corporate income tax would make the U.S. more competitive, according to the news source. However, some favor a more comprehensive approach, preferring that the federal government opt to eliminate the corporate income tax entirely.

The Tax Foundation has delved into the outcome of scrapping this particular policy, elaborating on how it would affect both business investment and also the size of the economy. In terms of the first benefit, eliminating the corporate income tax would effectively lower the minimum threshold companies need to get an adequate return on investment from purchasing capital equipment.

By reducing this tax, lawmakers would provide companies with greater incentive to invest in new items used for production and running businesses. Providing corporations with this particular motivation could in turn generate a handful of benefits.

If companies began buying more equipment, paying for such items would help circulate money throughout the economy. In addition, it could potentially create enhanced productivity for the firms buying the items by helping their workers get more accomplished with less time and effort.
<h2>Bolstering federal tax revenue</h2>
In addition, The Tax Foundation has asserted that by increasing business investment, eliminating the corporate income tax would spur job creation and push wages higher. By having this positive impact on the labor market and putting more money in people's pockets through lower corporate income tax rates, the change would enhance federal tax revenue over the long-term.

However, this income would likely shrink in the short-term as the economy adapted to the new policy, The Tax Foundation noted. More specifically, the nonpartisan think tank estimated that scrapping the corporate income tax would cause the federal government to automatically <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/cutting-the-corporate-income-tax-wouldnt-cost-any-revenue/article/2560630">forego $273.5 billion in corporate tax revenue</a>, according to The Washington Examiner.

However, within a time frame of approximately 10 years, the new policy would cause payroll, income and other tax revenues to enjoy a $273.9 billion annual gain, the media outlet reported. If such an increase came to fruition, eliminating the corporate income tax would generate no loss in revenue over the long term.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The House Committee plans to vote on legislation that would repeal the federal estate tax during the week starting Monday, March 23.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/House-Commitee.png" alt="The House Committee plans to vote on legislation that would repeal the federal estate tax during the week starting Monday, March 23." />The group of lawmakers will consider such a move after Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) <a href="http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/tax-practice/congress-mulls-repeal-of-estate-tax-74035-1.html">introduced the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015</a> in February, according to Accounting Today.
<h2>Estate tax proposal</h2>
While opponents of the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">estate tax contend that it unfairly hampers small businesses</a>, as well as those tied to family ranches and farms, the legislation sponsored by Brady would eliminate not only the so-called death tax, but also the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax, the media outlet reported.

During a recent hearing of the Ways and Means Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee, Dave Reichert (D-Washington) spoke to the challenges these fledgling businesses <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398202">frequently encounter</a>.
<h2>Lawmakers lament challenges</h2>
"The story is the same in all of our districts - family business owners and farmers work hard for their entire lives with the goal of passing on the fruits of their labor, but face the sometimes insurmountable hurdle of the death tax," he stated. "And in addition to the actual tax liability the death tax imposes, merely planning for it - regardless of whether these businesspeople and farmers end up owing it - is yet another challenge that we will hear discussed today."
<h2>House committee vote</h2>
Amid these difficulties, the House Ways and Means Committee will <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/236108-ways-and-means-to-vote-on-estate-tax-repeal">vote on eliminating the estate tax</a> for the first time in approximately one decade, Doug Andres, a committee spokesman, told The Hill. Congressional republicans have thus far failed to remove the tax completely, but they have managed to scale it down somewhat.

Currently, individuals do not have to pay the death tax on the first $5.43 million of their estate, while this figure is $10.86 million for a married couple. Estates that do trigger the levying of the burden generate a top tax rate of 40 percent.

The Hill reported figures from The Joint Committee on Taxation showing that eliminating this particular burden would cost the federal government nearly $295 billion over the course of 10 years. However, the portion of total tax revenues this policy brings in has declined over the years.

The estate tax provided 2.6 percent of this income four decades ago, but this portion plunged to 0.6 percent in 2014, the committee stated, according to the news source.
<h2>Future of bill</h2>
Assuming the proposed bill reaches the House floor for a vote and gains approval, many have speculated the legislation has very little chance of being signed into law, as President Barack Obama has advocated expanding the scope of the estate tax.

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>On March 18, North Carolina lawmakers <a href="http://philberger.com/news/entry/major-jobs-bills-filed-in-senate">introduced an economic development plan</a> that aims to make the state more competitive through reducing corporate income tax rates and enacting other reforms.</h2>
<a href="On March 18, North Carolina lawmakers introduced an economic development plan that aims to make the state more competitive through reducing corporate income tax rates and enacting other reforms."><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reducing-corprate-income-tax.png" alt="On March 18, North Carolina lawmakers introduced an economic development plan that aims to make the state more competitive through reducing corporate income tax rates and enacting other reforms." /></a>In addition to reducing corporate income tax rates, the proposal would simplify the method used to calculate their tax liability and provide incentives for manufacturers to invest in the Tar Heel State.
<h2>Push for economic policy overhaul</h2>
The Senate is considering this legislation after the administration of Gov. Pat McCrory (R-Georgia) floated a proposal that was mostly approved by the House earlier this month, according to The Associated Press.

Sen. Phil Berger, (R-Rockingham) leader of this legislative body, sponsored the Senate's version of the plan. Berger, along with other senators in his party, failed to provide the governor's proposal with a warm reception, the media outlet reported. The governor's version focuses almost entirely on specific economic incentive programs, and senate republicans are somewhat doubtful of these initiatives.

Berger offered his own version of the economic development program, asserting his rendition "answers the governor's call for economic development funds while improving the tax climate for all North Carolina businesses," according to the news source.
<h2>Senate economic development proposal</h2>
The bill Berger introduced contains several major components:

1) Corporate income tax cut: The bill would the cut the Tar Heel State's corporate income tax to 4 percent at the start of 2016 and then to 3 percent during the beginning of 2017. North Carolina's rate has fallen to 5 percent from 6.9 percent since 2013, but the proposed reduction would provide it with the lowest corporate income tax rate in the Southeast.

2) Simplifying corporate taxes: The proposal would tax companies based on the goods and services they sell in North Carolina. If businesses don't make these transactions in the Tar Heel State, they would not generate liability. Currently, many states that are close by, including Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, leverage a similar method.

If North Carolina can transition to using a single sales factor, it can help <a href="http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/mccrory-pans-senate-republican-nc-economic-develop/nkZQ7/">provide enhanced incentives</a> for companies looking to manufacture goods in the state and sell the bulk of these items elsewhere, according to The Associated Press. Such a development could help bolster investment in the Tar Heel State, motivating companies to purchase property and hire workers.

3) Enhance The Job Development Investment Grant: The recently introduced bill aims to upgrade an existing program <a href="http://www.thrivenc.com/incentives/financial/discretionary-programs/job-development-investment-grant">providing grants to companies</a> based on the amount of withholding taxes they pay for their employees.

By doing so, the legislation intends to make it easier for North Carolina to draw major manufacturing projects that commit to hiring at least 2,500 workers in the state and investing at least $1 billion.

While JDIG currently provides a large portion of these funds to a handful of counties, the proposal would ensure that other jurisdictions <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article15267221.html">receive the majority of these resources going forward</a>, according to The News &amp; Observer.

In 2014, nearly 90 percent of the JDIG funds allocated for all of North Carolina went to Durham, Wake and Mecklenburg, which have a median annual income nearing $57,000.

The economic stimulus package would come along with restrictions to ensure that funds would last longer and be dispensed in a responsible manner. While the JDIG disburses these funds on an annual basis, the proposal would distribute these grants every quarter.

In addition, the legislation would ensure that most of the grant money associated with the program would go to the state's remaining 97 counties, which have a median income of slightly more than $40,000.

Berger touted the benefits of the bill he introduced in the Senate, emphasizing its ability to streamline economic policy and produce job growth.

"This balanced plan will not only help North Carolina attract new jobs, but will also provide a real boost to the job-creators already making a valuable investment in our state's economy - instead of simply asking them to pay for new businesses to move here," he said in a statement. "By equipping Gov. McCrory with stronger tools to recruit major manufacturers, helping level the playing field for allocating economic development funds and providing much-needed tax relief, we will empower the entire state to grow and prosper."

On top this proposal, Sen. Rick Gunn (R-Alamance) introduced an additional bill that would empower the General Assembly by allocating another $5 million to the JDIG for the rest of 2015. With these resources, the assembly could work toward revising economic development programs that will affect the state in its entirety.
<h2>Lawmakers reply to Senate proposal</h2>
McRory quickly criticized the proposal, asserting that it would deprive the state of too much tax revenue, according to The News &amp; Observer. In addition, he claimed the Senate version of the economic development plan was "in strong disagreement" with the ideas put forth by his administration.

He continues to warn that if North Carolina doesn't provide its main incentives fund with more financial resources soon, companies will consider doing business in other states, the media outlet reported.

Amid these concerns, the matter of how many companies should fall under the single sales factor policy has generated a wide range of views, according to the news source. The House version of the bill would only let companies investing more than $1 billion in the Tar Heel State - most likely manufacturers - benefit from this particular tax treatment.

While lawmakers refused to provide exact figures on how much it would cost to implement Berger's single sales factor tax, Commerce Secretary John Skvarla told members of the media March 17 that the state <a href="http://www.wral.com/senate-economic-development-plan-would-lower-corporate-taxes/14523629/">could not afford to adopt this particular policy</a>, WRAL.com reported.

However, the Senate leader provided an opposing view, according to the news source.

"I would say we could not afford not to do it," Berger stated, emphasizing that many other states in the Southeast are harnessing the policy to incentivize companies, the media outlet reported.

Considering the sharp differences of opinion, it is safe to say that lawmakers may be in for some intense discussions as to how they should best address economic challenges in the Tar Heel State.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The imposition of penalties asserted against holders of undeclared offshore accounts has received much attention. Coupled with criminal prosecutions, including foreign banks, such as Credit Suisse and two of its bankers, should convince American citizens of the importance of compliance.</h2>
The compliance obligation also applies to resident aliens and this is not surprising. The untold story appears to be that of persons who U.S. citizens but do not know it. Imagine one’s surprise to learn that he or she is subject to these penalties for non-reporting even though he or she has never set foot in the U.S.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Accidental-American.png" alt="The imposition of penalties asserted against holders of undeclared offshore accounts has received much attention. Coupled with criminal prosecutions, including foreign banks, such as Credit Suisse and two of its bankers, should convince American citizens of the importance of compliance." />

We know that individuals born in the United States are U.S. citizens unless born to a parent having full diplomatic immunity. If born to a parent having only official acts immunity, the child is a U.S. citizen if born here. Not every person will make that distinction.

Even more surprising is that the birth of a child outside the U.S. may result in U.S. citizenship under certain circumstances. Any person born overseas to two U.S. citizen-parents was a U.S. citizen at birth provided at least one parent resided in the U.S. at any time prior to the child’s birth. Any person born overseas with only one U.S. citizen-parents was a U.S. citizen at birth provided at least one parent was physically present in the U.S. for five years at any time prior to the child’s overseas birth. Residence was not required. As one might expect, there have been prior versions of the rule to complicate evaluation. For overseas births occurring between 1934 and 1941, the child was a U.S. citizen if a parent was present in the U.S. at any time prior to the child’s birth. For overseas births occurring between 1941 and 1986, the parent was required to reside or be present in the U.S. for ten years, five of which must occurred after age 14 or 16.

These rules may have created a U.S. citizen out of a parent or grandparent, who, in turn, may have unintentionally caused a child or grandchild to become a citizen. This would also require the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/representation-before-taxing-authorities/">Accidental American to report the foreign account to IRS.</a>

Attorneys are frequently called upon to identify ownership by family members in order to apply various rules of attribution under the Internal Revenue Code. In the estate planning context, relationship is important in applying the special valuation rules in Chapter 27. Attribution rules appear in corporate (§318), partnership (§707(b)(3) and §267), pension (§414) and international (§958) taxation. In most cases, the familial relationship matters rather than U.S. citizenship of residency. In the international context, attribution in a CFC (Controlled Foreign Corporation) setting can have a different outcome if some owners are family members but are not U.S. citizens or residents. Given the rules on citizenship described above may create an Accidental American, great care must be taken in undertaking this evaluation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Earlier this year, Maine Gov. Paul LePage <a href="http://www.maine.gov/budget/documents/2016-2017BudgetOverview.pdf">released his 2016-2017 budget proposal</a>. This document contained several suggested reforms, including a change in the state's corporate income tax policy.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Gov-Paul-LePage1.png" alt="Earlier this year, Maine Gov. Paul LePage released his 2016-2017 budget proposal. This document contained several suggested reforms, including a change in the state's corporate income tax policy." />LePage has argued that currently, the state's tax policy puts it at a disadvantage and makes it less competitive compared to not only states in New England, but also the entire nation. The governor has repeatedly aimed to provide both corporations and residents of The Pine Tree State with lower income taxes.
<h2>Tax reform for Maine</h2>
The $6.3 billion proposed budget, which LePage has claimed will save Maine $300 million per year by 2019, would <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2015/01/09/politics/lepage-claims-300-million-in-savings-for-mainers-with-tax-reform-budget/">cut state income taxes</a> and make up for this lost revenue by increasing the sales tax, according to The Bangor Daily News.

The governor has championed income tax cuts before, spearheading a proposal in 2011 that resulted in Maine completely eliminating this particular burden for anyone generating an annual income of less than $5,000, the media outlet reported. In addition, his efforts caused the top tax rate to drop to 7.95 percent from 8.5 percent.

Now, LePage is looking to expand this tax relief granted to those in lower income brackets, as his budget would eliminate all state income taxes for those who bring in $9,700 per year or less, according to the news source. The proposal would also grant those with greater income progressively lower tax rates.
<h2>Corporate income tax reform</h2>
In addition to cutting income taxes for individuals, the governor's proposal would also reduce the income taxes paid by corporations, lowering their top rate to 6.75 percent from 8.93 percent. LePage suggested making this change as Maine's Revenue Forecasting Committee has forecast that during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the state will bring in $8.1 million in revenue through the corporate income tax.

The committee based this prediction on estimates for corporate profits, stating that these earnings would expand at a somewhat more rapid rate in 2015 and 2016, after rising at a modestly slower pace in 2014.
<h2>Sales tax reform</h2>
While LePage has specifically <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">targeted individual and corporate income taxes </a>for reduction, he has <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2015/01/13/the-point/what-can-maine-taxpayers-expect-from-lepages-tax-reform-plan/">taken aim at specific sales tax exemptions</a>, maintaining that having such a policy lacks adequate justification, according to The Bangor Daily News.

He asserted that instead of taking money out of people's paychecks, policy should provide a levy when they choose to buy goods and services, the media outlet reported. LePage's proposal would still exempt certain basic items such as groceries from sales tax, but it would adopt an amusement tax that would affect purchases of goods and services such as golf course admission, movie tickets and admission to historical sites. He asserted that his plan is based in fairness.

"Everybody's got to pay their fair share," stated LePage, according to the news source. "We're going to a consumption-based tax structure, so you pay as you go, rather than every Friday taking money out of your paycheck and sending it to the government."
<h2>Outcome uncertain</h2>
Under these policies, LePage's budget would generate $219 million in sales and use taxes in its first year, while at the same time providing the state's companies and residents with $176 million less in income taxes, according to The Bangor Daily News.

It is worth noting that while cutting taxes - for example those on residents and corporations - would reduce revenue for the state, the benefit of the proposed policies is uncertain, the media outlet reported.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.dickwoodbury.com/">Dick Woodbury</a>, a Harvard-educated economist and former state senator, recently offered his opinion on the Governor of Maine's 2016-2017 budget proposal.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Maines-2016-2017-Budget.png" alt="Dick Woodbury, a Harvard-educated economist and former state senator, recently offered his opinion on Governor of Maine's 2016-2017 budget proposal." />The top state official has proposed overhauling a wide range of tax policies, with lowering income taxes for residents and corporations a major focus.
<h2>Push to reduce income tax burden</h2>
LePage has repeatedly made efforts to <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2015/03/12/politics/lepage-says-he-wants-maine-income-tax-gone-by-2020/">reduce income taxes for both individuals and companies</a>, and announced earlier this month that he wants to provide The Pine Tree State's voters with a referendum that will give them the option to eliminate Maine's income tax permanently, according to The Bangor Daily News.

If this constitutional amendment is successful, it would add Maine to the nine states that have no income tax currently, the media outlet reported. LePage wants to place this option before voters in 2016, with the intention of having the income tax eliminated completely by 2020.

In the interim, Maine's governor is working to reduce this burden for residents and corporations, proposing in the governor of Maine's 2016-2017 budget that the state <a href="http://www.maine.gov/budget/documents/2016-2017BudgetOverview.pdf">cut its top corporate income tax rate to 6.75 percent</a> from 8.93 percent.
<h2>Economist reply</h2>
When responding to Maine's 2016-2017 budget proposal, Yarmouth <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2015/03/25/politics/economist-proposes-9-changes-to-lepages-tax-reform-plan/">lauded the governor's approach</a>, stating "I hope you pull this off," according to The Bangor Daily News. In addition, he emphasized his reservations, stating that the legislature may resist specific aspects of the proposal. The economist noted that one major cost created by the proposal was lower tax revenue.

When speaking to individual provisions, Yarmouth singled out the proposed cut in<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/"> corporate income taxes</a>, stating that while the current policy may drive companies away, LePage's proposed reduction may be too much, the media outlet reported. Instead, Yarmouth advocated providing a more modest reduction in the top rate.
<h2>Income tax changes</h2>
In his 2016-2017 proposal, LePage has suggested increasing the individual income tax exemption to $9,700 from its current level of $5,000. In addition, he has suggested lowering the tax rates for those in higher brackets.

The current exemption level came from a 2011 proposal supplied by the governor, which resulted in the state eliminating income taxes for both those at the lowest end of the spectrum and also reducing the rates on those in the highest bracket.
<h2>Push to eliminate income tax</h2>
In continuing these progressive reforms, LePage has since announced his desire to eliminate the state's income tax entirely.

Yarmouth has criticized such statements, asserting that talking about scrapping the income tax completely could result in the governor losing a great deal of support, according to The Bangor Daily News. The economist asserted that before even considering such a measure, he wants to get a better sense of what the budget will be. Yarmouth did, however, leave the door open to such a possibility.]]></content>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/federal-taxes.jpg" alt="The desire to reform federal taxes has managed to generate substantial momentum, an InvestmentNews opinion piece asserted. " />The piece, which was published March 15, went live after President Barack Obama, Rep. Dave Camp (R-Michigan) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) proposed different plans for revising the federal tax structure.

These proposals all contain common themes of simplifying the tax code, along with spurring more robust economic growth and job creation. However, the methods they offer to achieve these ends vary significantly. While these plans aimed to affect many different aspects of tax policy, this particular article will delve into how they would impact corporate taxes.
<h2>Obama proposal</h2>
Obama provided his proposal during the State of the Union address in January, suggesting making corporate income tax policy simpler and giving companies greater incentive to repatriate their earnings instead of retaining them overseas.

By making it more appealing for corporations to take these profits earned overseas and then move them back home, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/representation-before-taxing-authorities/">federal tax law could enable greater investment and hiring in the U.S.</a> In addition, making the federal tax code less intricate would help trim business costs by eliminating superfluous staff involved with accounting.
<h2>Camp's proposal</h2>
Camp's proposal - The Tax Reform Act of 2014 - <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=370987">would cut the top corporate income tax rate to 25 percent</a> from 35 percent. In addition, his plan aims to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax for both pass-through businesses and corporations. An analysis conducted by The Joint Committee on Taxation predicted that Camp's proposal would generate multiple benefits:
<ul>
<li>Gross domestic product would rise as much as $3.4 trillion.</li>
<li>The economy would create up to 1.8 million new private sector jobs.</li>
<li>The tax changes would not increase the budget deficit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marco-Rubio plan</h2>
In March, Marco and Rubio <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=2d839ff1-f995-427a-86e9-267365609942">announced a new tax proposal</a>, which, like the aforementioned plans, would cut the top corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. In addition, the plan would permit firms to engage in full expensing, a greater benefit than what exists under current <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax law</a>.

When speaking with members of the media, he emphasized that his main concern was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/03/04/rubio-unveils-tax-plan/">helping jumpstart economic growth</a>, instead of determining which groups will benefit at the expense of others, according to The Washington Post.

One major issue that has come up is the impact on tax revenue, the InvestmentNews piece noted. According to the Tax Foundation's initial review, the Marco-Rubio plan would cut tax revenue by $414 billion a year. The two senators have emphasized that when the reform's impact on economic growth and the resulting increase in tax income is considered, the figures would be different.

The Tax Foundation came back and stated that while it would take 10 years for the aforementioned growth to completely come to fruition, but once this happens, it would result in a $90 billion increase in annual tax revenue.

While lawmakers may not approve this particular plan, it is entirely possible they will end up finalizing something slightly different. These government officials seem to have plenty of options to choose from. Maybe this abundance of different plans will combine with the existing desire for change to spur helpful reform.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Scrapping income taxes completely <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102549217">would generate several benefits</a>, starting with the hassle that many corporations and individuals face during tax season, expert Peter Morici contended in a recent CNBC commentary piece.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/income-taxes.jpg" alt="Scrapping income taxes completely would generate several benefits, starting with the hassle that many corporations and individuals face during tax season, expert Peter Morici contended in a recent CNBC commentary piece." />Policy analysts have repeatedly advocated changing tax policy for both of these two groups, but corporate income taxes in particular have generated significant visibility in recent months.
<h2>Negative consequences</h2>
Morici, an economist and professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, asserted that the current policy affecting these corporate levies results in several negative consequences, including a complex system full of exemptions and deductions.

This intricate framework has resulted in lawmakers providing equally complex proposals, for example one the author cited as having an executive summary 194 pages long. This plan, which would require specific education and expertise to understand, was tabled by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman David Camp.
<h2>Reform efforts</h2>
A wide range of lawmakers, academics and policy analysts have proposed reforms that would simplify and or reduce corporate income tax rates, but these plans have failed to receive approval.

Earlier this year, President Barack Obama proposed cutting the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">corporate income tax rate and making it easier for global companies to repatriate their foreign earnings.</a> Currently, these or businesses have an incentive to keep these profits, which are generated overseas, where they were earned in the first place.

By making it more difficult for these organizations to bring this money back home, many analysts assert that current policy is holding up investment and job creation in the U.S. Morici specifically mentioned this problem in his commentary piece, emphasizing that unless they move their production facilities overseas, many companies based in the U.S. will end up paying higher taxes than their foreign competitors.
<h2>Expert's proposed solution</h2>
This current policy negatively impacts the nation's jobs market, and while Morici emphasized that many have proposed tax reform with good intentions, the simplest way to address these challenges would be to eliminate income taxes for both corporations and individuals.

To replace the $1.7 trillion these levies brought the U.S. federal government in 2014, he suggested imposing a 12 percent sales tax affecting all private purchases and other payments. Under such a plan, corporations would subtract any taxes paid for items they bought from taxes they collected and then provide this amount to the U.S. Department of Treasury.

Corporations would be able to lower expenses because they would no longer need to value their inventories, and they would also have the ability to avoid double taxation, Morici noted.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>On March 25, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) reintroduced legislation that would <a href="http://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=e5f14061-04ff-4d3a-bb91-ff1030f0d8dc">permanently eliminate the federal estate tax</a>. In a statement released the same day, Thune lamented the challenges faced by small businesses and emphasized the job creation that could result from ending the federal estate tax.</h2>
<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/small-businesses.gif" alt="On March 25, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) reintroduced legislation that would permanently eliminate the federal estate tax. In a statement released the same day, Thune lamented the challenges faced by small businesses and emphasized the job creation that could result from ending the federal estate tax." />Potential economic stimulus</h2>
"Currently more than 70 percent of small businesses do not survive to the second generation, and 90 percent of family businesses do not survive to the third generation," said Thune. "According to a study by former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, repealing the death tax would create 1.5 million additional small business jobs and would shave almost a percentage point off the unemployment rate."

The bill, which carried the title the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 and was identical to a separate piece of House legislation proposed by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), quickly gained support in the Senate. On March 26, Thune lauded his fellow Senators for <a href="http://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7991e0ff-baa6-499d-a33e-b24c6cc34559">voting to incorporate his amendment</a> into the Fiscal Year 2016 budget resolution.

While their vote was non-binding, it did <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/237479-abolish-the-death-tax-say-senate-republicans">show their support for the bill</a>, according to The Hill. As of March 31, 27 senators had endorsed Thune's proposed legislation. In addition, several industry representatives backed the bill, including the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of Manufacturers and The Association for Manufacturing Technology.
<h2>Broad support</h2>
The Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, a group of more than 50 organizations that support repealing the estate tax permanently, penned a letter to Rep. Sanford Bishop and Brady, thanking them for introducing the House version of the bill, H.R. 1105.

"The FBETC supports the provisions in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 including a $5 million estate tax exemption, indexed for inflation, permanent lower tax rates and provisions for spousal transfer and stepped-up basis," the letter stated. "While these changes represent significant reform to the estate tax rules, the FBETC continues to believe that repeal is the best solution to protect all family-owned businesses from the estate tax."

While these bills may pass the House and Senate, any final piece of legislation could face challenges receiving the approval of President Barack Obama, as he recently proposed increasing estate taxes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Washington is in urgent need of tax reform, and as a result, lawmakers <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/12/nick-novak-federal-tax-reform-time-now/?page=all">should seriously consider improving the current system</a>, writer Nick Novak emphasized in a recent Washington Times article.</h2>
<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tax-reform.gif" alt="Washington is in urgent need of tax reform, and as a result, lawmakers should seriously consider improving the current system, writer Nick Novak emphasized in a recent Washington Times article." />Urgent need for reform</h2>
Novak, director of communications for think tank the John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy and contributor for the Washington Times, pointed to the nation's current fiscal situation and the complex nature of the tax code, noting that he would be surprised if lawmakers did not consider reform in the near future.

These government officials have several potential options to choose from, as many lawmakers have offered proposals for tax reform. While their suggestions have mentioned several aspects of the tax code, the corporate income tax is one particular matter that has drawn attention.
<h2>Corporate income tax reform</h2>
Currently, companies headquartered in the U.S. pay a top corporate income tax rate of 35 percent. In comparison, the other 33 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development pay an average rate of 25 percent.

In addition, businesses headquartered in France, Belgium and Sweden, which are considered high-tax European countries, <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/us-has-highest-corporate-income-tax-rate-oecd">pay rates</a> of 34.4 percent, 34 percent and 22 percent,respectively, according to the Tax Foundation.

Over the last few years, the largest trading partners of the U.S. - Japan, the U.K. and Canada - have cut their corporate tax rates in order to make themselves more appealing economically.
<h2>Incentive to hold profits overseas</h2>
Given the current tax framework, many global companies based in the U.S. keep the profits they earn in foreign countries overseas instead of repatriating them and paying the corporate income tax rate.

While this situation might benefit foreign investment, some have warned that it undermines both investment and job creation in the U.S. by discouraging major companies from bringing their profits home.

In an effort to make the current tax code more fair, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) have introduced a tax proposal that would cap the corporate income tax rate at 25 percent. In addition, the bill proposed by these two lawmakers would allow companies to deduct 100 percent of the expenses associated with capital investments, including equipment, land, structures and inventories.

In the tax proposal, the lawmakers stated that by reducing the top corporate income tax rate and providing businesses with greater ability to expense, they could help improve domestic economic activity by eliminating onerous taxes.
<h2>Obama proposal</h2>
President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/02/in-new-budget-obama-to-proposed-14-percent-tax-on-overseas-corporate-profits-to/">has also offered a proposal</a> during his State of the Union Speech. Under this plan, the top corporate income tax rate would fall to 28 percent. In addition, the federal government would impose a one-time, 14 percent tax on all profits held overseas.

In the future, foreign earnings would have an immediate 19 percent tax rate, and companies would receive a credit for all taxes paid to governments overseas. Finally, the proposal would lengthen depreciation lives.
<h2>Tax burden</h2>
At the same time that lawmakers are offering their proposals, the nation's taxpayers are paying billions in the aggregate to file their taxes, Novak emphasized. He cited a 2011 report released by the Laffer Center, which stated that the direct outlays associated with filing these taxes cost Americans roughly $31.5 billion a year.

However, the Rubio-Lee plan would simplify the tax code, and the author stated that in the long run, it would have the additional benefit of accelerating economic growth by putting more money in the hands of consumers and bolstering their spending.

Building upon the aforementioned statements, Novak stated that while the Rubio-Lee proposal is likely not perfect, it does represent progress toward federal tax reform. The push to streamline the tax code seems to have built up significant momentum, and hopefully lawmakers will enact change in the near future.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The number of S&amp;P 500 firms that do not pay U.S. corporate income taxes has surged to an all-time high.</h2>
At a time when many enterprises are performing inversions and shifting their legal addresses overseas, a record 54 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-14/how-10-percent-of-s-p-companies-opted-out-of-paying-u-s-taxes">achieved a lower effective tax rate</a> from the U.S. corporate income tax, Bloomberg reported.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sP500.jpg" alt="The number of S &amp; P 500 firms that do not pay U.S. corporate income taxes has surged to an all-time high." />
<h2>Changing corporate structures</h2>
As a result, the number of firms in the index that enjoy this particular status has risen more than 100 percent from four years ago, according to the media outlet reported. While some firms have been declaring themselves real estate investment trusts to obtain more favorable tax treatment, others have been completing inversions, which involves them transferring their legal address to another country.

Some companies have been converting to REITs, which are taxed as pass-through entities because of the way they are set. These strategies have drawn a great deal of attention, ranging from Washington lawmakers to industry experts who want to give their two cents on corporate tax policy.
<h2>High corporate income tax rate</h2>
Many of these observers and commentators have noted that companies based in the world's largest economy currently pay a top income tax rate of 35 percent, which is one of the highest of any developed nation. In addition, the tax code currently contains a complex web of deductions and subsidies, and as a result, some major firms pay an effective tax rate that is far lower.

Amid this situation, calls for tax reform have gained significant momentum, and over the last several months, numerous lawmakers have proposed simplifying the<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/"> existing treatment of corporate income and also reducing tax rates.</a>
<h2>Obama tax proposal</h2>
Earlier this year, President Barack Obama outlined a proposal that would <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/basics-president-obamas-state-union-tax-plan">lower the top corporate income tax rate to 28 percent</a> in order to make the U.S. more competitive relative to other nations.

In addition, his plan would lengthen depreciation lives and impose a minimum tax on foreign profits. Under current tax code, companies that generate earnings through overseas activities can simply keep these resources in foreign nations instead of bringing them back to the U.S.

Critics have contended that the current system encourages such global companies to invest overseas, as by keeping their financial resources there, the firms would not have to pay the high corporate income tax rates imposed in the U.S.
<h2>New inversion rules</h2>
While the fate of this proposal - and the other ones that have been floated in Washington - is uncertain, the U.S. Department of the Treasury <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-22/treasury-unveils-anti-inversion-rules-against-tax-deals">announced new rules in September 2014</a> that will make it more difficult for U.S. companies to conduct inversions for the purpose of enjoying more favorable tax treatment, according to Bloomberg.

Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/22/statement-president">commented on these actions</a> in a statement, lauding the progress made.

"We've recently seen a few large corporations announce plans to exploit this loophole, undercutting businesses that act responsibly and leaving the middle class to pay the bill, and I'm glad that Secretary Lew is exploring additional actions to help reverse this trend," he stated.

When speaking with members of the media, Lew said that by making these changes, he wanted to give companies more reason to avoid performing an inversion, Bloomberg reported. Even though the Treasury took this step, working with Congress can potentially generate far greater results, Obama emphasized in a statement.
<h2>Companies weigh in</h2>
Amid this situation, many companies that changed their corporate structure have asserted that they are obligated to legally minimize their tax bills because they answer to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. Paul Bisaro, chairman of specialty pharmaceutical Actavis Plc., stated that the current tax code is detrimental to firms based in the U.S.

There may be evidence to support his claim, as several high-profile companies in the S&amp;P 500 - including Iron Mountain - have altered their corporate structure to become a REIT and therefore enjoy more favorable tax treatment. Even after such changes, it is worth keeping in mind that almost all firms listed in the S&amp;P 500 that have either switched over to REIT status or performed an inversion still pay some U.S. corporate income taxes.]]></content>

<h2>Corporate tax landscape has changed</h2>
While speaking at the 15th Annual NYU/KPMG Tax Lecture Series, he spoke to how the landscape for business taxes has changed over the years, the media outlet reported. Following the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the U.S. corporate income tax rate - which was 34 percent at the time - was one of the lower rates for industrialized economies.

However, Mazur noted that while rates fell in many countries, they climbed slightly in the world's largest economy, reaching 35 percent, according to the news source. Because of this, the government official pointed out that U.S. taxes have become high relative to the nation's peers.
<h2>Corporate Income Tax Policy reform proposals</h2>
The high corporate income tax rate levied by the U.S. has taken front stage in policy discussions, and several prominent lawmakers have already proposed new approaches. President Barack Obama <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/basics-president-obamas-state-union-tax-plan">outlined several different changes</a> he would enact during the State of the Union address, which include cutting the corporate income tax's top rate to 28 percent, making depreciation lives longer and levying a minimum tax on all profits earned overseas.

Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) also offered their own proposal, which would <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">reduce tax burdens for companies</a> by allowing them to take part in full expensing and also <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/The-Presidents-Framework-for-Business-Tax-Reform-02-22-2012.pdf">lowering their top income tax rate to 25 percent</a>. Rep. Dave Camp (R-Michigan) has presented a plan as well, which would make the same reduction in the corporate income tax to 25 percent but also scrap the Alternative Minimum Tax for corporations and pass-through entities.
<h2>Urgent need for change</h2>
Many different options for reform are on the table, and Mazur stressed the urgency of taking things in a new direction, the media outlet reported. Currently, the system of corporate taxes is "inefficient," "overly complex" and having too many loopholes. Mazur asserted that while our system of corporate taxes is supposed to be world class, it no longer operates this way, and reform is needed to return policy to this state.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Generating effective tax reform in Washington will likely be difficult, as both the tax code - and the tax base - are complex.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/effective-tax-reform.jpg" alt="Generating effective tax reform in Washington will likely be difficult, as both the tax code - and the tax base - are complex." />While many advocate lowering corporate income tax rates, a wide range of businesses have <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Smart-Tax-Reform-Has-Account-Massive-Change">sharply reduced their tax liabilities</a> either by not repatriating their active income earned overseas or by harnessing tax breaks, The Fiscal Times reported.

In addition, many companies have changed their corporate structure to become pass through entities - including partnerships, sole proprietorships and S-corporations - in order to lower their tax rates, according to the news source. After making such a shift, organizations must pay individual income tax rates on their earnings, which are lower than those that corporations pay on their profits.
<h2>Tax base shifts</h2>
As a rising number of organizations have taken advantage of this opportunity, the tax base has shifted. A Joint Committee on Taxation review produced earlier this year detailed these changes, stating that in fiscal year 2014, corporate income tax receipts were 1.9 percent of gross domestic product. While this figure was slightly higher than the last two years, it <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/us-usa-tax-individuals-idUSKBN0MQ2BZ20150330">fell short of the average fraction</a> since 1950, which is 2.6 percent, according to Reuters.

The JCT report also revealed that businesses filed 1.64 U.S. corporate tax returns in 2012, compared to 2.18 million in 2000, the media outlet reported.
<h2>Individual returns rise</h2>
While the number of corporate tax returns has declined over roughly the last 15 years, the IRS has been receiving more returns from sole proprietorships, and these organizations filed 23.5 million such returns in 2012, compared to 17.9 million in 2000, according to the news source. In addition, the returns filed by S-corporations and partnerships increased.

The change in tax revenue provided by these organizations has also been significant, The Fiscal Times reported. Pass through entities generated $1.4 trillion in revenue by 2010, a sharp increase from the figure of $100 billion a year in the 1980s. Urban Institute economist Joe Rosenberg analyzed IRS data, and discovered that business income provided $850 billion worth of adjusted gross income on individual returns.

"It's really kind of changed the landscape, and it's made the whole issue of what is the composition of individual taxes very different," Howard Gleckman, who works for the Urban Institute as a Resident Fellow and is an expert on tax policy, told the news source.

During a recent interview, he emphasized that it is often challenging to differentiate business taxation from the individual tax code, the media outlet reported. Gleckman - and other experts - have stated that because so many businesses have changed their structures, any tax reform proposals must account for the shifting landscape.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Despite a common language, there are differences in tax planning when it comes to the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US).</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/differences-in-tax-planning.jpg" alt="Despite a common language, there are differences in tax planning when it comes to the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US)." />The differences in tax planning are the direct result of a trends or a structural changes in tax law. Clearly, the trend is against the accumulation of wealth inside of trusts.

Trusts were a vehicle in the UK and the US for the accumulation of wealth for many years due to more favorable trust income tax rates. In 2006, the UK imposed a charge on trust principal of 6% to be paid every ten years. In addition, the UK imposed a transfer tax of 20% on every transfer in excess of £325,000 (the “Nil Band”). UK tax planning was forced to discontinue the extensive use of trusts because these toll charges would reduce principal significantly.

The UK corporate tax rate in 2012 was 24% for large corporations and 21% for small corporations in 2012. The individual UK tax rate was 50% and 45% in 2012 and 2013. The tax rate has declined to 20% for 2015 for both large and small corporations. It is easy to understand the renewed interest in using corporations to shelter income.

The US attack on trusts proceeded in a different manner. The US burdened trusts with the highest income tax rate (39.6%) and the tax on net investment income (3.8%) where income exceeded $12,300. Although the unified credit has increased, the<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/"> income tax burden on trusts discourages excessive accumulation of income.</a>

Planners in the UK gravitated to the use of corporations and limited partnerships with different classes of interests. In the UK, an outright gift escapes the 20% charge that would apply to a gift to a trust; however, a donor must survive seven years for the gift to escape UK Inheritance tax. Using outright gifts to the next generation and the Nil Band for gifts in trust, wealth transfers are being accomplished.

The ownership interests are a mix of redeemable preferred interests to the parent, income interests and redeemable interests to the children. The entity pays tax at a lower corporate rate. There is a zero income tax band up to (approximately) £34,000 so that distributions to children can escape income tax. The UK taxes income accumulated in a trust for a child under age 18 at a parent’s tax rate, somewhat similar to the US Kidde Tax. The UK tax provision does not apply to family investment vehicles so the directors may declare a dividend on a particular class of shares when a child attains age 18. This technique may not be acceptable in the US, however, it shows that culture and attitude toward commercial transactions influences what can be done.

What is clear is the bias is against trusts on both sides of the Atlantic.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Currently, just about everyone has an opinion on estate tax reform.</h2>
A proposal to permanently repeal the federal estate tax has obtained approval in the U.S. House of Representatives, but there are many - including lawmakers, policy analysts and various kinds of experts - who have spoken their opinion on estate tax reform.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/opinion-on-estate-taxes.jpg" alt="Currently, just about everyone has an opinion on estate tax reform." />

Opponents of abolishing the so-called death tax have contended that the policy hampers small businesses, giving them an <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">unnecessary burden that can interfere with their ability to operate properly.</a>
<h2>Advocates of repealing tax speak out</h2>
A perfect example of a lawmaker who has illustrated the cost of the federal estate tax is Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., who explained that following her father's death in a farming accident, her family <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-bill-to-repeal-estate-tax-1429205647">needed to borrow money</a> to pay off the estate tax burden, according to The Wall Street Journal.

"We owed [the government] money because we had a tragedy happen," stated Noem, the media outlet reported. "It took us 10 years to pay off that loan."
<h2>A burden for small businesses</h2>
Reps. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and Steve Scalise, R-LA., also criticized the estate tax in a USA Today column, asserting that the policy <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/15/death-tax-rep-kevin-brady-house-whip-steve-scalise-editorials-debates/25852603/">forces many families to sell their small business</a> simply to appease the IRS.

While those who oppose repealing the death tax assert that eliminating the levy would benefit the wealthiest Americans, Brady and Scalise asserted that farmers, ranchers and entrepreneurs - who have their wealth stored in assets like property, real estate and capital equipment - would suffer. As for the super rich, many have asserted that these Americans can find countless ways to reduce their tax burdens.

Finally, the authors cited figures from nonpartisan think tank The Tax Foundation, which reveal that repealing the estate tax will result in the creation of 139,000 new jobs and also increase worker compensation.

Regardless of which arguments are circulated, many political observers have emphasized that President Barack Obama has been quite critical of any efforts to eliminate the federal estate tax, and has threatened to veto any legislation that would enact this change should it reach his desk. Before the bill gets to the leader of the free world, it would need to get past the Senate, where its reception is unclear.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Creating effective tax reform in Washington will likely be difficult, as both the tax code - and the tax base - are complex.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Creating-Effective-Tax-Reform.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Creating-Effective-Tax-Reform.gif" alt="Creating effective tax reform in Washington will likely be difficult, as both the tax code - and the tax base - are complex." width="400" height="400" /></a>While many advocate creating effective tax reform, a wide range of businesses have <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Smart-Tax-Reform-Has-Account-Massive-Change">sharply reduced their tax liabilities</a> either by not repatriating their active income earned overseas or by harnessing tax breaks, The Fiscal Times reported.

In addition, many <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">companies have changed their corporate structure</a> to become pass through entities - including partnerships, sole proprietorships and S-corporations - in order to lower their tax rates, according to the news source. After making such a shift, organizations must pay individual income tax rates on their earnings, which are lower than those that corporations pay on their profits.
<h2>Tax base shifts</h2>
As a rising number of organizations have taken advantage of this opportunity, the tax base has shifted. A Joint Committee on Taxation review produced earlier this year detailed these changes, stating that in fiscal year 2014, corporate income tax receipts were 1.9 percent of gross domestic product. While this figure was slightly higher than the last two years, it <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/us-usa-tax-individuals-idUSKBN0MQ2BZ20150330">fell short of the average fraction</a> since 1950, which is 2.6 percent, according to Reuters.

The JCT report also revealed that businesses filed 1.64 U.S. corporate tax returns in 2012, compared to 2.18 million in 2000, the media outlet reported.
<h2>Individual returns rise</h2>
While the number of corporate tax returns has declined over roughly the last 15 years, the IRS has been receiving more returns from sole proprietorships, and these organizations filed 23.5 million such returns in 2012, compared to 17.9 million in 2000, according to the news source.

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The federal gift tax limit <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Whats-New-Estate-and-Gift-Tax">will remain the same this year</a> as it was last year, according to the IRS.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gift-Tax-Limit.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gift-Tax-Limit.gif" alt="2015 Gift Tax Limit" width="399" height="399" /></a>As a result, a taxpayer (donor) may gift as much as $14,000 to each recipient (donee) without being required to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">file a gift tax return</a> or paying gift taxes on these amounts. In addition, married couples can provide as much as $28,000 to a donee in gifts each year without generating gift tax liability on such transactions.
<h2>The federal estate tax, which is tied to the federal gift tax limit, also saw its exemption move higher in 2015 - rising to $5.43 million compared to $5.34 million in 2014.</h2>
For married couples, the amount is $10.86 million. If a taxpayer makes gifts, he or she will need to keep records of these donations because the total amount given is counted toward the federal estate tax amount.
<h2>Exemption from the generation-skipping transfer tax also increased this year, rising to $5.43 million from $5.34 million in 2014.</h2>
This particular levy involves transfers of wealth to grandchildren or other distant relatives made during their lifetime or death. Taxpayers should bear in mind that if they trigger the estate tax, gift tax or the generation-skipping transfer tax at the federal level, their tax rate could reach as much as 40 percent.
<h2>These higher exclusions of the federal estate and gift tax limit <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr8eas/pdf/BILLS-112hr8eas.pdf">became locked in</a> when Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.</h2>
This made certain tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 permanent. Pursuant to legislation approved earlier in the previous decade, the federal gift tax exclusion was $11,000 in 2004 and 2005, $12,000 between 2006 and 2008, $13,000 for the years 2009-2012 and $14,000 from 2013 on.

Going forward, the gift tax limit exemption <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/summary-estate-and-gift-tax-law-changes-2015">will track higher</a>. Due to inflation, it will rise in increments of $1,000, according to The National Law Review.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The number of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index-listed firms that do not pay U.S. corporate income taxes has surged to an all-time high.</h2>
<a href="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lower-Effective-Tax-Rate.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-8311"><img class="  wp-image-8311 alignright" src="http://sportsentertainmentattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lower-Effective-Tax-Rate.gif" alt="The number of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index-listed firms that do not pay U.S. corporate income taxes has surged to an all-time high." width="373" height="373" /></a>At a time when many enterprises are performing inversions and shifting their legal addresses overseas, a record <strong>54</strong> companies in the S&amp;P 500 have <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-14/how-10-percent-of-s-p-companies-opted-out-of-paying-u-s-taxes">achieved a lower effective tax rate</a> from the U.S. corporate income tax, Bloomberg reported.
<h2>Changing corporate structures</h2>
As a result, the number of firms in the index that enjoy this lower tax rate has risen more than 100 percent from four years ago, according to the media outlet. While some firms have been declaring themselves real estate investment trusts to obtain more favorable tax treatment, others have been completing inversions, which involves them transferring their legal address to another country.

Some companies have been converting to REITs, which are taxed as pass-through entities because of the way they are set. These strategies have drawn a great deal of attention, ranging from Washington lawmakers to industry experts who want to give their two cents on corporate tax policy.
<h2>High corporate income tax rate</h2>
Many of these observers and commentators have noted that companies based in the world's largest economy currently pay a top income tax rate of 35 percent, which is one of the highest in any developed nation. In addition, the tax code currently contains a complex web of deductions and subsidies, and as a result, some major firms pay a lower effective tax rate.

Amid this situation, calls for tax reform have gained significant momentum, and over the last several months, numerous lawmakers have proposed simplifying the existing treatment of corporate income and also reducing tax rates.
<h2>Obama tax proposal</h2>
Earlier this year, President Barack Obama outlined a proposal that would <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/basics-president-obamas-state-union-tax-plan">lower the top corporate income tax rate to 28 percent</a> in order to make the U.S. more competitive relative to other nations.

In addition, his plan would lengthen depreciation lives and impose a minimum tax on foreign profits. Under current tax code, companies that generate earnings through overseas activities can simply keep these resources in foreign nations instead of bringing them back to the U.S.

Critics have contended that the current system encourages such global companies to invest overseas, as by keeping their financial resources there, the firms would not have to pay the high corporate income tax rates imposed in the U.S.
<h2>New inversion rules</h2>
While the fate of this proposal - and the other ones that have been floated in Washington - is uncertain, the U.S. Department of the Treasury <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-22/treasury-unveils-anti-inversion-rules-against-tax-deals">announced new rules in September 2014</a> that will make it more difficult for U.S. companies to conduct inversions for the purpose of enjoying more favorable tax treatment, according to Bloomberg.

Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/22/statement-president">commented on these actions</a> in a statement, lauding the progress made.

"We've recently seen a few large corporations announce plans to exploit this loophole, undercutting businesses that act responsibly and leaving the middle class to pay the bill, and I'm glad that Secretary Lew is exploring additional actions to help reverse this trend," he stated.

When speaking with members of the media, Lew stated that by making these changes, he wanted to give companies more reason to avoid performing an inversion, Bloomberg reported. Even though the Treasury took this step, working with Congress can potentially generate far greater results, Obama emphasized.
<h2>Companies weigh in</h2>
Many of the companies that changed their corporate structure have asserted that they are obligated to legally minimize their tax bills because they answer to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. Paul Bisaro, chairman of specialty pharmaceutical Actavis Plc., stated that the current tax code is detrimental to firms based in the U.S.

There may be evidence to support his claim, as several high-profile companies in the S&amp;P 500 - including Iron Mountain - have <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/">altered their corporate structure</a> to become a REIT and therefore enjoy more favorable tax treatment. Even after such changes, it is worth keeping in mind that almost all firms listed in the S&amp;P 500 that have either switched over to REIT status or performed an inversion still pay  U.S. corporate income taxes.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>House Vote Pushes Us One Step Closer To Estate Tax Repeal</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tax-Estate-Repeal.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tax-Estate-Repeal-300x300.jpg" alt="Tax Estate Repeal" width="500" height="500" /></a>The federal estate tax, which has long been opposed by many Americans, was recently abolished by the U.S. House of Representatives with 240 members of Congress voting for the estate tax repeal and 179 voting against it.
<h2>Supporters Laud House Vote</h2>
Supporters <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/us/politics/house-votes-to-repeal-estate-tax.html">lauded the outcome of this vote</a>, declaring it a victory for small-business owners, including farmers, according to The New York Times. House Speaker John Boehner released a statement, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/repealing-death-tax-protect-family-farmers-ranchers-small-businesses">expressing his approval</a> of the vote.

"Family farmers, ranchers and small-business owners work tirelessly to create jobs in our communities, put food on our tables and, God willing, have something to pass on to their children and grandchildren," he said. "Taking away that opportunity with a massive death tax bill is simply wrong."
<h2>White House Voices Protest</h2>
However, the White House viewed the repeal differently, regarding the House vote as an attempt to provide the richest Americans with more money, according to The New York Times. Repealing the death tax would also increase federal budget deficits, the White House emphasized.

Eliminating the provision would cost the U.S. Department of Treasury $269 billion over the course of 10 years, with $14.6 billion of that being lost during fiscal year 2016, according to figures provided by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation and reported on by the media outlet.

Many political analysts have been closely watching the creation of tax policy in Washington, with the two parties fighting to protect the interests of different groups. A wide range of fiscal conservatives have been critical of Obama's tax initiatives.

While Republicans have repeatedly insisted the president compensate for any tax cuts he proposes with a policy that would increase revenue, they do not have any plan to increase revenue to make up for the shortfall created by their <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">proposed estate tax cut</a>, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest emphasized, according to The New York Times.

Obama noted earlier this month that the Republican plan represents the exact opposite of his desire to cut taxes for low and middle-income families, the media outlet reported. When visiting North Carolina, the president emphasized that repealing the estate tax would benefit 120 households in the Tar Heel State, while his policies would help 44 million people.

With that in mind, the legislation that would repeal the federal estate tax will now go to the Senate, and if the bill survives, it will reach the desk of Obama, who has been highly critical of repeal effortst]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>"Levying a state corporate income tax <a href="http://www.taxanalysts.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-9W9H8Q?OpenDocument">is a waste of time</a>", tax expert, David Brunori, wrote in The Tax Analysts Blog.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/State-Corporate-Income-Tax.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/State-Corporate-Income-Tax.gif" alt="Do we really need a state corporate income tax?" width="340" height="340" /></a>Brunori, research professor at George Washington University and deputy publisher of Tax Analysts, asserted that states should repeal this particular policy. "States should, at the very least, conduct an honest inquiry into why they have a corporate income tax in the first place", he stressed. Advocates of such levies have offered many reasons as an explanation, including producing revenue for states, lowering inequality and helping remunerate individual states for the benefits they provide companies. However, Brunori emphasized the cost of imposing this policy - which involves planning, auditing and litigation.
<h2>Federal Proposals</h2>
Brunori made his arguments for eliminating the state corporate income tax at the same time lawmakers are considering reforming corporate income tax policy at the federal level. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama has proposed cutting the top rate for this levy on corporate income to 28 percent, imposing a minimum tax on all profits earned overseas and extending depreciation lives.

Obama is not alone in his desire to reform corporate income tax policy, as Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., proposed cutting the top rate to 25 percent and also eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax for corporations and pass-through entities. In addition, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, suggested lowering the top rate to the same level of 25 percent and also permitting companies to take part in full expensing.
<h2>Meager Income</h2>
As the corporate income tax draws attention at both the federal and state levels, Brunori asserted that the policy does little to pad state coffers. Brunori pointed to a <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/TaxFoundation_FF463.pdf">report</a> from the Tax Foundation, titled "State Corporate Income Tax Rates and Brackets for 2015," which stated that corporate income taxes account for only 5.2 percent of state tax collections and slightly more than 2 percent of all state tax revenue.

In 2014, the state corporate income tax raised about $46 billion out of roughly $870 billion worth of taxes, he noted. Since states have opted to avoid combined reporting and instead provided tax incentives and weaker apportionment formulas, the levy is ineffective at generating revenue. If states want the policy to effectively produce income, they should take the exact opposite approach. Thus far, states have been resistant to making any such change.

"While some support taxing corporate profits to provide states with greater revenue, others contend that such policies help fight inequality through redistribution", Brunori noted. While this argument has succeeded in generating visibility, the tax expert emphasized that it is based on the assumption that shareholders bear the burden of corporate income taxes. However, not everyone buys into this premise, as some contend that consumers pay this cost and others state that workers do.

Because of all this disagreement, lawmakers who advocate<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/"> taxing corporate income at the state level</a> will need to provide sound justification for doing so, Brunori predicted.
<h2>Consumption Taxes</h2>
Some argue that a Value Added Tax would provide greater revenue than a corporate income tax.  The burden is imposed on consumption, thereby shifting taxation to those transactions that consume resources.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The House of Representatives recently took action to protect individuals who make large gift donations</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Large-Gift-Donations.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Large-Gift-Donations.gif" alt="New legislation protects those who make large gift donations to non-profit organizations." width="345" height="345" /></a>By approving legislation that would ensure these donations do not incur the gift tax, H.R. 1104, the Fair Treatment for All Donations Act, <a href="http://roskam.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-roskam-introduces-bill-to-stop-irs-targeting-donations">now affects gifts</a> made out to 501(c)4, 501(c)5 and 501(c)6 non-profit organizations.
<h2>The New Legislation</h2>
Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, introduced the legislation earlier this year. In a statement, Roskam emphasized that the IRS has never levied gift taxes on donations made to nonprofits. However, the agency <a href="http://www.fa-mag.com/news/mega-donors-freed-from-gift-tax-they-never-paid-21418.html">sent letters to donors</a> in 2011, inquiring about these donations, according to Bloomberg News.

Currently, any gifts worth more than $14,000 are subject to taxation, so by codifying IRS policy, lawmakers can proactively insulate specific groups that take part in elections and do not reveal the identity of their donors, the media outlet reported.
<h2>Benefits of the New Legislation</h2>
Roskam touted the benefits of his legislation, emphasizing the need to provide fair treatment for all Americans who make donations to tax-exempt organizations.

"Although the IRS claims it is no longer seeking to curb giving to social welfare organizations, we need assurances that this practice will never happen in the future," he said. "The Fair Treatment for All Donations Act, which will codify the longstanding practice of exempting these contributions from the gift tax, marks an important step in shielding Americans from further burdensome taxes and intrusive scrutiny by the IRS."

While this bill obtained approval in the House, lawmakers introduced a similar version in the Senate, according to Bloomberg News. At the same time, the IRS is in the process of developing rules that would affect exactly what nonprofits can do <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">without endangering their tax exemptions </a>or ability to protect the identity of donors.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Corporate-Tax.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Corporate-Tax.gif" alt="If the U.S. wishes to stay relevant in today's economy, serious tax law amendments need to happen." width="401" height="401" /></a>U.S. corporate income tax law puts the country at a disadvantage relative to many others, resulting in slower economic growth, lost tax revenue, capital flight and fewer jobs, economist Aparna Mathur wrote in a recent Forbes article. The nation has an urgent need for reform and it is important that policy makers not let the many different opinions on what the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">tax code</a> should be hinder meaningful reform, said Mathur, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
<h2>US falls behind</h2>
The U.S. has fallen behind other countries by failing to reform its tax code, acting only to reduce marginal tax rates on corporate income only a handful of times in the last two decades, she noted. Comparatively, the other nations have cut their marginal corporate tax rates significantly in an attempt to attract more robust investment. More importantly, many nations asset taxing jurisdiction on a territorial basis and avoid the complexity of the U.S. system of world-wide taxation, tax credits, controlled foreign corporation rules and Subpart F income.

The impact of this failure to keep up is that the world's largest economy misses out on potential investment, said Mathur. She cited one study, "The effect of corporate taxes is on investment and entrepreneurship," which used data for first- and fifth-year corporate income tax rates for 85 countries.

The research <a href="http://espanol.doingbusiness.org/methodology/~/media/FPDKM/Doing%20Business/Documents/Methodology/Supporting-Papers/DB-Methodology-Effect-of-Corporate-Taxes-on-Investment-and-Entrepreneurship.pdf">found a definite relationship</a> between corporate investment and entrepreneurship and the effective tax rates of companies. Manufacturing in particular suffered a decline in investment when effective corporate income tax rates were higher.
<h2>Urgent need for change</h2>
Many policy makers have pointed to this situation, complaining that the U.S. is bleeding opportunity because its tax code is subpar. President Barack Obama and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., have both proposed plans to reform the nation's treatment of corporate income taxes. Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have also supplied their own joint proposal.

One trend that has helped generate significant support for efforts to reform the tax code is the existence of tax inversions. Amid concerns that the incidence of these inversions might arise, Obama directed the U.S. Department of the Treasury to create a new set of rules that would lessen the benefit of these legal maneuvers or halt them altogether, Mathur noted. Most of the growth in the coming years will be in the Asia-Pacific region and many inverting companies are attempting to restructure so earnings may be handled more tax efficiently than with repatriation.

However, while some might point their finger at the companies taking this step, many economists have emphasized that it is not the firms that are at fault, but an ineffective tax code, the author wrote. While all these challenges may seem troubling, they are helping fuel an urgent need for reform. As a result, there is widespread agreement that such change is needed; however, disagreement remains on the type of change to be undertaken.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Double Taxation &amp; the Federal Estate Tax</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Double-Taxation.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Double-Taxation.gif" alt="Lawmakers are looking to end double taxation for good." width="400" height="400" /></a>As many lawmakers push to end the federal estate tax for good, one national senator has written a letter to the Twin Falls Times-News, contending that this particular policy <a href="http://magicvalley.com/news/opinion/columns/reader-comment-repealing-the-death-tax/article_04f38dc5-c678-592c-9fb1-0f46dd17cd62.html">may be one of the least fair taxes</a> on the books due to the double taxation it creates. In the piece, Sen. Michael Dean Crapo, R-Idaho, voiced his support for scrapping the policy and lamented the impact it has had on residents of his home state.

Crapo is certainly not alone in this sentiment, as many have stated that the levy can interfere with families passing down their small businesses.

Those looking to garner support for eliminating the measure entirely have repeatedly pointed to instances where entrepreneurs had to sell their companies even though they had remained in the family for generations.
<h2>Effects of the Policy</h2>
Those unlucky enough to trigger this levy have a 40 percent tax to pay, and Crapo noted IRS figures indicating Idaho residents with taxable federal estates footed an average federal estate tax bill of $1.6 million in 2013. In addition to generating this liability, many families invest significant time, energy and money into estate planning to meet their obligations.

Overcoming these hurdles can be even worse in certain areas where land values have soared, presenting the owners of this property with high tax burdens, the Republican senator noted. No small business owner should be prevented from passing their life's work on to their children.

Over the last several years, lawmakers have focused a great deal on tax reform. Since 2000, government officials have enacted several changes to federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax law</a>. However, Crapo emphasized that they have failed to create the policies needed to put our economy in a better place, which would include simplifying the tax code, making the tax base larger and cutting rates for Americans. If lawmakers are truly interested in creating jobs and stimulating the economy, they should start by eliminating the death tax for good.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>U.S.-based agrochemical giant Monsanto Co. is currently negotiating a $45 billion buyout proposal of rival Syngenta as a tax inversion strategy to relocate to the UK, according to the Financial Times.</h2>
<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monsantos-Proposed-Tax-Inversion-Plan.png" alt="U.S.-based agrochemical giant Monsanto Co. is currently negotiating a $45 billion buyout proposal of rival Syngenta as a tax inversion strategy to relocate to the UK, according to the Financial Times. If Monsanto's proposed tax inversion plan is accepted, this would mark the largest tax inversion in U.S. history with estimated annual savings close to $500 million." /></h2>
If Monsanto's proposed tax inversion plan is accepted, this would mark the largest tax inversion in U.S. history with estimated <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/monsanto-pursues-500-million-u-s-tax-cut-with-syngenta-deal">annual savings close to $500 million</a>.
<h2>Monsanto's proposed tax inversion plan<strong> seeks tax savings.</strong></h2>
According to Monsanto CEO and Chairman Hugh Grant, the merger is designed to encompass the two corporations into a global agribusiness enterprise to expand geographical outreach. However, the tax inversion acquisition would effectively reduce <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/syngenta-rejects-unsolicited-monsanto-acquisition-proposal-1431069142">Monsanto's tax rate from 29 percent to 15 percent</a>, the WSJ reported. Britain is an ideal location for overseas subsidiaries to set up headquarters because of its 20 percent tax rate, which includes additional tax incentives for foreign-based entities.
<h2>The impact on global agribusiness</h2>
This merger would become the largest ever agribusiness takeover, which would effectively monopolize the global seeds and chemicals markets, the WSJ report noted. Monsanto and Syngenta combined for $57 billion in pesticide sales alone in 2014, with a 30 percent market share on pesticides, and another 45 percent market share for seeds. Together, the two companies would generate <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-23/monsanto-said-to-have-weighed-40-billion-syngenta-deal">$600 million in new revenue,</a> increasing cash-earnings-per-share by over 16 percent from the<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-tax-planning/"> tax savings and benefits structure</a> in Britain, according to a report in Bloomberg Business.
Ultimately, farmers would be most affected by the deal because it could significantly change all agribusiness sectors.  According to John Hansen, President of the Nebraska Farmers Union and a prominent board member of the National Farmers Union, the deal would eliminate competition.

"When you have that much market power, there's too much money to be made using your market power to push the company's interests forward," Hansen said.
<h2>Criticism from the US government</h2>
President Obama has been an outspoken critic of tax inversions because these strategies <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/syngenta-rejects-unsolicited-monsanto-acquisition-proposal-1431069142">manipulate the tax system and diminish the U.S. tax base</a>. Several other Congressman have been critical of tax inversions as well, including Senator Richard Durbin who argued that rules should be enacted to block these strategies.
"It's clear that Monsanto – a company that has prospered and expanded in large part due to U.S. taxpayer-funded programs and services – intends to reincorporate overseas as part of its proposed acquisition of Syngenta in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes," he argued. "Hundreds of millions of dollars that could be invested in the infrastructure, education and research that companies rely on will be lost if Monsanto is allowed to go through with this corporate inversion scheme."

In fact, several Democrats have proposed an overhaul of the federal tax system where corporations like Monsanto would continue to pay U.S. tax rates overseas. According to USA Today, with involvement from U.S. politicians, the floodgates have opened to eliminate the tax inversion loophole altogether.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Don’t Believe the Negative Hype Regarding US Corporate Income Tax Policy</strong></h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Corporate-Income-Tax-Policy.png" alt="Don’t Believe the Negative Hype Regarding US Corporate Income Tax Policy" />The US corporate income tax policy is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/upshot/the-us-corporate-tax-isnt-that-weird.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1">less stringent than its opponents contend</a>, according to a recent New York Times opinion piece written by economic expert Josh Barro.

Some have claimed that the US Corporate Income Tax Policy levies a tax on all the profits that an America-based company earns throughout the world.

These policies have been at the center of much debate, as many lawmakers have floated their corporate income tax proposals over the last several months. President Barack Obama - and also republican lawmakers - have both suggested more territorial policies, meaning that c<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/representation-before-taxing-authorities/">orporations only pay taxes on their profits in the jurisdictions </a>where those earnings are generated.

Currently, the U.S. uses a system whereby companies incorporated in the United States can generate profits from an active business overseas, paying taxes on these earnings before transferring or repatriating them back to the U.S. and paying taxes once again. While many object to these corporate tax systems, the author notes that they always incorporate some essence of territoriality. Income from passive sources known as Subpart F income, is subject to immediate inclusion in income. Foreign corporations are subject to taxation on the income earned in the United States.

Barro emphasized that when companies based in the U.S. pay taxes for active income generated overseas, they receive credits, and they do not have to pay any domestic earnings on products until they bring them back to the U.S. It is also worth noting that many companies based in the world's largest economy benefit from foreign tax credits. In some instances, America-based companies can generate robust profits and pay little or no taxes in their home country if they properly manage their foreign income and tax credit position.

Other nations use differing policies, for example, levy a minimum tax on a company's worldwide profits, tax passive foreign income without exception and limit the freedom companies have to allocate their profits across different countries by rigid transfer pricing, the author emphasized.

Because of all these considerations, the corporate income tax policy used by the U.S. and other large economies - namely its major trading partners - might not be as different as some would think]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Last week, the IRS announced its final rules on the estate tax portability of the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount, which clarifies that portability is only granted to executors if the <a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/media-resources/news-media-resources/checkpoint-news/daily-newsstand/final-regs-modify-and-clarify-earlier-guidance-on-deceased-spousal-unused-exclusion-amount/">gross value of the estate is below $5.4 million.</a>
<strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Estate-Tax-Portability.png" alt="Last week the IRS announced its final rules on the estate tax portability of the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount, which clarifies that portability is only granted to executors if the gross value of the estate is below $5.4 million." width="406" height="406" /></strong>

<strong>Portability rules</strong>

The new IRS rules specify that the surviving spouse can elect portability to use the DSUE amount for their own life and death, according to Reuters. However, these requirements state that the use of the DSUE amount is only granted to the surviving spouse if the estate of the descendants died between January 1, 2011 and June 12, 2015. Therefore, the extension time is only accessible for individuals leaving up to $5.4 million, after which executors are <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2015/jun/irs-portability-rules-for-estate-tax-201512499.html">subject to a federal estate tax levy</a>. According to Ashlea Ebeling of Forbes, it is vital to understand how portability works.

"Portability was ushered in effective Jan. 1, 2011 when the estate tax exclusion amount—the amount an individual can leave at death without facing a federal estate tax levy—was bumped up to $5 million, or otherwise, indexed for inflation," Ebeling noted. "In 2015, for example, an individual can leave $5.43 million estate tax-free at death. With portability, a surviving spouse can carry over any unused portion of the deceased's exclusion—the deceased spousal unused exclusion or DSUE amount."

If the value is below this threshold, descendants are not required to file an estate tax return. However, in the event of exceeding the DSUE amount, the IRS only allows executors to elect portability if <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">federal estate tax returns are "completely and properly prepared."</a>

<strong>The implications of the new regulations</strong>

One of the disadvantages of the final ruling is that if the asset values in the estate were to increase substantially, thereby causing the gross value of the estate to increase past the threshold, that individual is subject to estate taxes and loses portability access. However, spousal and executor designation is another issue, because even if the surviving spouse is not the executor but has a vested interest in the estate, they cannot elect portability. In turn, this exposes the estate to further taxation after the surviving spouse dies. Eileen Sherr, Senior Technical Manager for the American Institute of CPAs, noted that the surviving spouse is still exposed to the complex process of applying for an extension.

"Now we're back to the same situation before the relief," Sherr opined. "A lot of people just don't realize they need to do it."

The IRS also placed limits on the availability of DSUE amounts for non-citizens, stating that surviving spouses do not have access to the estate account unless they become a citizen after the death of the deceased or are explicitly allowed to in a treaty obligation. Furthermore, the final rules prohibit estate tax havens for descendants, with the exception of certain qualified domestic trusts. What this means for taxpayers is that the DSUE amount must be recalculated because of the tax benefits of qualified domestic trusts. These designations are significant because they prohibit surviving spouses and executors from maintaining their rights to the value of the estate while potentially increasing their estate tax burden.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The recent tax reform proposal from New Jersey State Senator, Raymond Lesniak, would create an income tax hike for residents over $350,000, but would also <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/06/12/lesniak-urges-income-tax-hike-estate-tax-cut-for-wealthy/">remove the estate tax</a>.</h2>
According to the NJ Spotlight, the plan is estimated to generate more than $850 million in tax revenue, enabling the state to pay down its $83 billion unfunded pension liability.

<strong><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Estate.gif" alt="Estate" width="400" height="400" /></strong>
<h2>The proposed plan</h2>
After Governor Christie vetoed all previous income tax hikes, Lesniak's reform bill would effectively cut the $350 million estate tax. However, the bill would simultaneously increase the income tax for high net worth residents to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/10/lawmakers-hope-to-bury-death-tax-in-nj/23194471/">$1.2 billion</a>, making it the largest income tax in New Jersey history. The state would also have the third highest income tax in the nation, but still rank behind New York and California.

The "millionaire tax" reform would increase the state income tax for residents making more than $350,000 from 6.37 percent to 8 percent. This includes rate hikes for individuals at $500,000 to 10.25 percent, and stiffer increases for residents with over $1 million to 10.75 percent.

According to the report, the state owes $2.75 billion to fulfill its budget deficit from 2014-2015, which includes <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/06/12/lesniak-urges-income-tax-hike-estate-tax-cut-for-wealthy/">$53 billion in unfunded pension liabilities</a>. Senator Lesniak stated that New Jersey has not made pension payments for 20 years.

"Without additional revenues, the state is facing a train wreck at the end of June that could only be duplicated by Congress. No one wants that to happen," Senator Lesniak argued. "Public and private workers all need to have their pension income secure. Our proposal will help the governor and legislators fulfill that obligation."

The $850 million that the plan would generate is sufficient to fund the third year of pension payments missed in 2014.
<h2>Problems with the proposal</h2>
Critics of the proposal argued that it does not address Governor Christie's $900 million cut in pension payments from the 2014 budget. The debt accrued is the result of a significant drop in revenues from state income taxes in 2014, which raises concerns that further tax hikes would drive wealthy residents out of New Jersey.

Furthermore, critics point out that Lesniak's plan falls short of fulfilling the <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2015-04-23/news/61422385_1_pension-talks-pension-system-christie-spokesman-kevin-roberts">$1.5 billion necessary</a> to bring pension payments on schedule. Ultimately, without a solution to the pension crisis, there is no hope to balance the budget for 2015, which means that an additional pension cut is inevitable.

There is also criticism that the bill hurts small businesses in the state, because many of them pay taxes through personal income taxes to avoid the stiffer business tax rates.
<h2>The impact</h2>
Senator Lesniak noted that by eliminating the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">estate tax</a>, he hopes to convince residents to stay in New Jersey. According to New Jersey Chamber of Commerce President, Tom Bracken, the New Jersey Estate tax, when levied against individuals with estates worth $675,000 or more, would save millions for <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/06/12/lesniak-urges-income-tax-hike-estate-tax-cut-for-wealthy/">high net worth retirees</a>.  It remains to be seen if wealthy residents would perceive the immediate annual burden of an income tax increase as acceptable.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>New York state has long been a gift tax haven, but recent changes to legislation have <a href="http://www.bnymellonwealthmanagement.com/Resources/documents/perspectives/new-york-estate-tax-change.pdf">reduced the burden of the estate tax as well</a>.</h2>
By doubling the estate tax exemption from $1 million to over $2 million, New York has positioned itself as one of the most gift and estate tax friendly states in the U.S.
<h2>The gift tax exemption</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tax-Friendly-States.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tax-Friendly-States.gif" alt="Tax Friendly States" width="400" height="400" /></a>Even though New York state does not have a gift tax, the taxable exemptions for gifts have decreased. According to the new <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law">tax laws</a>, lifetime and death bed gifts given within 3 years of death are now included in the estate tax. However, in response to the inclusion of gifts into estate taxes, New York legislators approved a "cliff" tax where an estate is only taxed if its amount exceeds 105 percent of the state exclusion amount. Therefore, for a $1 million estate, there is now a $420,800 tax exemption, making this the highest statutory exclusion amount in the state's history. In fact, according to estate tax attorney, Bernard Krooks, this new cliff tax is more tax friendly than ever.

"The bottom line: if you live in New York, don't own property in a state that imposes a gift tax and are worth less than about $5 million," he said. "You are simply going to be unable to pay a gift tax over your entire life, no matter how hard you try."

The benefits of the new laws certainly outweigh the burdens, but the only drawback to the tax exclusion is that assets with potential to generate future income are subject to the federal gift tax.
<h2>Benefits of the new tax exemption</h2>
New York legislators also removed the generation-skipping transfer tax, making this a significant tax advantage for spouses and family of non-citizens. This benefit extends to gifts for two or more generations below the sender, thereby excluding residents from paying the previous <a href="http://www.bnymellonwealthmanagement.com/Resources/documents/perspectives/new-york-estate-tax-change.pdf">16 percent tax rate.</a>

Furthermore, this new benefit eliminated the need for a domestic trust fund in the event that a non-citizen does not file a federal tax return. Ultimately, this means that certain residents of New York state can avoid paying <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">estate taxes</a> altogether.
<h2>The significance of the law</h2>
The gift and estate tax exemption will remove the divide between the state and federal estate exclusion amounts. Since April 1st, 2014, the exclusion rate was set to increase by over $1 million per year until January 1st, 2019. This progression began at $2.062 million and will <a href="http://wealthmanagement.com/wealth-planning/new-york-state-significantly-changes-its-estate-and-gift-tax-regimes">end at $5.25 million in 2017 </a>before matching the federal tax exemption amount the following year. What this means for state taxpayers is that gifts can now be converted into charitable donations that encompass education and medical expenses, insurance and tax payments, and home purchases for other people.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Currently, the gift tax exclusion <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/stop-worrying-gift-tax-pay/" target="_blank">threshold is $14,000</a>, but most high net worth individuals will probably never pay the tax, according to the Motley Fool.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gift-tax-exclusion.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gift-tax-exclusion.gif" alt="gift tax exclusion" width="402" height="402" /></a>This is due to the fact that even if individuals exceed the $14,000 limit, they will most likely only need to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">file a gift tax return</a> and apply part of the unified credit - equal to $5,430,000 in 2015 - although they will not owe any money to the federal government.
<h2>The gift tax exclusion</h2>
The original intention of the gift tax was to prevent individuals from skirting federal estate taxes prior to death. However, despite its design, the gift tax is avoidable because current laws have two provisions in the federal gift tax exclusion that only require most individuals to file a gift tax return. The annual gift tax exclusion allows individuals to give gifts valued at no more than $14,000 per person (donee) for 2015 without paying gift tax or filing a gift tax return.

The annual gift tax provision is the more popular alternative because it saves the lifetime exclusion for the estate tax, which applies only to estates (and lifetime) valued at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rbcwealthmanagement/2015/06/05/5-tips-for-handing-down-your-wealth/" target="_blank">$5.43 million</a>. Therefore, even if a gift amount exceeds the $14,000 threshold, an individual will need to file a gift tax return and apply a portion of their lifetime exclusion toward the gift, which eliminates the gift tax altogether. However, the $14,000 threshold only applies to gifts to one donee, meaning that an individual can give several $14,000 gifts to different donees in 2015 without being subject to the gift tax. The benefits extend with a married couple as well because these couples can give $28,000 per donee in gifts to an unlimited number of individuals without tax repercussions.

The second alternative is to use the lifetime exclusion in gifting, which enables individuals to exceed the $14,000 threshold without paying tax. With this provision, individuals can file gift tax returns for a large gift and apply the a portion of their lifetime exclusion. The $5.430 million threshold may be applied to gifts made during life or applied against their taxable estate. A gift of $114,000 to one donee would reduce the lifetime exclusion by $100,000 to $5,420,000.
<h2>Benefits of the gift tax exclusions</h2>
There are other annual and lifetime gift tax exclusions that do not reduce the lifetime exclusion or count toward the $14,000 annual limitation, such as an unlimited marital gift deductions, tuition and medical expenses. An individual is allowed to gift to a spouse for an unlimited amount without being subject to the gift tax threshold. However, in the case of tuition and medical expenses, there is also an unlimited threshold amount for gifts if the payments are made directly to the educational or medical institution.

According to a recent interview in Forbes, Thomas Brockley, Senior Vice President at RBC Wealth Management, noted that there are several options to avoid paying federal gift taxes so that recipients receive the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rbcwealthmanagement/2015/06/05/5-tips-for-handing-down-your-wealth/" target="_blank">maximum amount of the gift</a>. Particularly with estates left in the event of death because gift assets left to recipients may be eligible to count against the federal gift tax exclusion amount of $5.43 million.]]></content>

		<id><![CDATA[5955]]></id>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>According to a Forbes report last week, Walmart has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2015/06/18/walmart-report-on-76-billion-hidden-in-tax-havens-flawed/">$76 billion in foreign tax havens</a>.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/walmart.jpg" alt="Ac cording to a Forbes report last week, Walmart has $76 billion in foreign tax havens." />The report claimed that the world's largest retail chain has 78 subsidiaries in 15 overseas tax havens where the company has no store locations.
<h2>Walmart's hidden assets</h2>
The report claimed that Walmart is effectively avoiding U.S. corporate taxes on overseas operations for 3,500 stores in China, Japan, South Africa, Central America, South America and the U.K. As the study noted, Walmart placed 90 percent of its foreign assets in Luxembourg, the British Virgin Islands, Curacao, and the Netherlands, the most corporate tax-friendly countries in the world. These countries are considered as excellent locations to establish headquarters or holding companies because they do not tax profits generated outside of their borders and have favorable dividend and remittance. Furthermore, the retail giant reportedly paid less than one percent in <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/17/walmart-has-76b-hidden-in-overseas-tax-havens/">taxes on $45 billion</a> in Luxembourg, where the company does not have a store location. It is not clear how much tax was paid in the operating countries.

Since 2009, Walmart has created 30 foreign subsidiaries that were not reported to the U.S. Treasury Department. With this increase in overseas subsidiaries, the company has cut over $3.5 billion in corporate income taxes from 2008 to 2015. During that period, Walmart's overseas revenues increased from $10.7 billion in 2008 to more than $23.3 billion in 2015.
<h2>The implications</h2>
The study reported that none of the foreign entities were disclosed in regulatory filings, although the study did not address the use of disregarded entities as a possible explanation. The report contends that Walmart may have been skirting U.S. tax inversion and public disclosure laws because all domestic entities are required to disclose subsidiaries accounting for more than <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2015/06/18/walmart-report-on-76-billion-hidden-in-tax-havens-flawed/">10 percent of all assets</a>.

After the report, The United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union is now calling for government response to the issue. According to the report, "sweetheart" tax incentive deals from overseas tax havens may be in <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">direct violation of new laws regulating offshore disclosure</a>. The report, however, does not reconcile the differences between worldwide and territorial systems of taxation.

Ultimately, the investigation in Walmart's foreign tax disclosures could <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-17/wal-mart-has-76-billion-in-overseas-tax-havens-report-says">restructure the international income tax system</a>. Critics point out that it is impossible to determine exact calculations on earnings in foreign tax havens without proper disclosure.
<h2>Walmart responds</h2>
Spokesperson Randy Hargrove stated that Walmart placed assets in these foreign subsidiaries to be reinvested for future growth opportunities overseas. In his claim, Walmart holds approximately 30 percent of its operations in foreign retail locations, resulting in 32 percent corporate income tax on all revenues from 2011 to 2014.

Hargrove also correctly pointed out that unless these assets are repatriated, the retail giant is not subject to current taxation and public disclosure laws. In response, the company also released its annual report showing that Walmart paid $6.2 billion in federal corporate income taxes for 2014, accounting for two percent of corporate income taxes collected that year.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The new Internal Revenue Service rules, indexed for inflation, now permit married couples to leave nearly <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-tax-break-for-married-couples-1436537358">$10.86 million</a> to their heirs untaxed.</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/married-couples1.jpg" alt="The new Internal Revenue Service rules, indexed for inflation, now permit married couples to leave nearly $10.86 million to their heirs untaxed." width="298" height="332" />The generous ruling is both estate and gift tax-free for married couples who have not set up expensive trusts prior to death.
<h2>The Advantages Of The New Rules</h2>
For several decades, married couples were at risk of losing one of their two estate tax exemptions if they did not establish trusts before they died or pass property outright to a non-spouse. However, as some high net worth couples may not have the ability to set up one of these estate trusts, the new rules allow for spouses to conduct post-death planning to ensure their estates are intact.

This is significant because although these exemptions have been available for couples, the new rules allow couples to leave all their assets to their spouse without losing one of the two exemptions. Prior to these new estate exemptions, individuals could only leave half as much money, but now with the special election after death, individuals can preserve the value of the second exemption. This is significant because each exemption is $5.43 million, which means that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/new-estate-tax-breaks-for-married-couples/8E55AAA9-199F-461F-811D-0EF52BE7B807.html">only 4,000 families</a> will be required to pay estate taxes this year.
<h2>The Portability Rules</h2>
According to the new rules a spouse can elect "portability" after their spouse dies, and the unused $5.43 million exemption carries over to the surviving spouse. This portability gives the surviving spouse a tax shelter to pass on assets to their heirs while also expanding the exemption total to $10.86 million. The importance of these new rules also benefits surviving spouses who receive a windfall from the lottery, inheritance or remarriage to someone with substantial assets. Furthermore, these new portability rules allow surviving spouses to carry over the unused exemption from their deceased spouse into their next marriage, providing a spouse potentially three exemptions provided the surviving spouse uses the exemption of the deceased spouse before the death of the new spouse. If the new spouse dies before the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse may not use the exemption the deceased spouse from the first marriage. The first spouse's unused exemption may only be used by the surviving spouse, as it cannot be passed on to a new spouse from the second marriage.

The <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">exemption may protect more estates from paying estate tax</a>, but the increase in income tax rates, especially those for capital gains,  compels estate planning that will provide the heirs with a step-up in basis in order to negate  capital gain taxation.  Many of these plans are as complex as those used before portability.

Although there are significant benefits, individuals must file an estate tax return to elect portability, even if the estate is below the exemption. The new rules also required that these returns be submitted within nine months of death. According to Don Williamson, Executive Director of the Kogod Small Business Tax Center at American University, this has the potential to be overlooked.

"This is a very real problem," Williamson commented. "Not opting for portability can shortchange the survivor and can put the executor at risk of being sued."

However, the IRS reported these new portability rules are expected to <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/tax-break-married-couples-220500689.html">increase the number of federal estate tax filings</a> for 2015.]]></content>

" width="336" height="387" /></a>The comment was written in response to our blog that described the impact of this state’s Inheritance Tax and Estate Tax upon New Jersey resident decedents.

The comment was made by a family business owner who was unaware of the death tax burden imposed by New Jersey upon his estate. The $675,000 per person state exemption would not be large enough to protect the transmission of wealth from him and his wife to their children. After considering various <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/sophisticated-estate-planning-and-wealth-preservation/">options which included extensive tax planning</a>, he decided to relocate his business to Florida. The death tax and income tax savings more than offset the cost of the move. Not only did he and his spouse move to Florida, but they persuaded all of their children to relocate as well.
<h2>In May, I attended a function hosted by a regional accounting firm.</h2>
Two accountants that I know well began to discuss the outbound migration of their client base, who were long-term residents of New Jersey. They claimed that thirty-six of their high net worth clients have moved themselves and their significant net worth to other states. They commented that they recommended relocation from New Jersey to twice that number of clients and expect more to follow.

At that same function, an attorney complained that the New Jersey would not accept the federal estate tax treatment of a self-cancelling installment note. IRS accepted the federal estate tax return as filed without change issued a closing letter. By doing so IRS accepted the SCIN as reported. New Jersey refused to follow the federal treatment stating that it is not bound by a federal determination on any issue. If the New Jersey estate tax is predicated upon the federal estate tax law and IRS determined a particular item is correctly reported, what is the justification for a contrary and arbitrary position? No surprise, the parties will be going to court. A client of my firm has an issue pending with the taxing authorities that is controlled by the holding in the state Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Whirlpool</em>. Despite what we believe to be a clear application of the <em>Whirlpool</em> decision upholding our position, the state is holding out for money and will make the client go to court. The deficit is dictates its position.
<h2>Capital is fluid and moves where there is opportunity for higher returns and lower costs.</h2>
Texas Governor Greg Abbott was a guest on Bloomberg radio and was touting the growth of the Texas economy, net positive migration and job creation. The announcer pointed out that Texas has tax revenue from oil production and Florida has sales tax revenue from tourism that allow those two states to seek less revenue from income and estate taxes. The Governor replied that Texas is committed to live within its existing means and avoid new taxes and tax increases that choke growth and prosperity. He commented that pension problems and budget deficits in other states have taken as a warning by Texas to control spending rather than raise taxes.

The departure of wealthy clients from New Jersey suggests their assessment of the current and future economic environment is negative. Simply, they believe this state is not able make the necessary changes in the face of entrenched interests so they vote with their feet. The budget and pension deficits in recent years being prime examples. Is it sound for New Jersey to continue policies that encourage residents to leave this state?]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Last week New Jersey's Economic Development Authority approved <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/jpmorgan_awarded_188_million_nj_tax_break_to_move.html">$190 million in tax credits</a> over a 10-year period for JPMorgan Chase to relocate its headquarters to the state.The incentive agreement calls for $18.8 million per year, including $8,734 per job.</h2>
<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/JPMorgan.jpg" alt="Last week New Jersey's Economic Development Authority approved $190 million in tax credits over a 10-year period for JPMorgan Chase to relocate its headquarters to the state." /></h2>
The company's relocation will create 2,150 technology jobs for its Jersey City campus, bringing the total to 7,000 jobs in New Jersey, according to the EDA. As part of the tax credits, the company will receive more than <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/jpmorgan_awarded_188_million_nj_tax_break_to_move.html">$1.1 billion in tax benefits</a> through the program. JPMorgan also agreed to invest more than $76 million to expand its <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/location/jersey-city">Jersey City location</a>. All told, the project is expected to generate $665.5 million in new revenues for the state over a 20-year period.

This new tax credit for JPMorgan comes after a $225 million "Grow New Jersey" grant given to the company in 2014, which called for 1,000 new jobs, with 2,612 jobs retained. However, as part of the stipulations of the deal, JPMorgan must fulfill its promise of 1,000 new jobs before it receives the new tax credit. According to JPMorgan spokesperson Andrew S. Gray, the company turned to New Jersey after New York City rejected hundreds of millions of dollars in proposed tax credits.

"Obviously, the proximity to the city, it's closer in terms of relocation, that's certainly a consideration," Gray commented. "But the Jersey City package "proved to be the most economically viable for us, so that's why we moved forward."

The EDA reported that JPMorgan will maintain its current jobs in Jersey City, New York City, Delaware and Ohio, but all new positions will go to the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/location/jersey-city/">Jersey City location</a>. This tax credit program received bonuses because the median salary at the Jersey City location is $164,000, exceeding the median income level for Hudson County. However, the company also received bonuses for transit-related developments and for the number of new jobs it will create with the credit.
<h2>Criticism</h2>
The tax credit has come under criticism from local Democrats and left-learning organizations because it was among <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/08/jpmorgan-to-add-1000-jobs-keep-2600-in-new-jersey.html">$300 million handed out to major corporations</a>, including $27 million to keep Jaguar Land Rover North America in Mahwah and $5 million to attract Peeq Imaging LLC to Carlstadt. This corporate tax subsidy program is a rapidly growing initiative by Governor Christie, according to Jon Whiten, Deputy Director of New Jersey Policy Perspective.

"But these subsidies aren't just getting bigger, they're becoming even better deals for corporations, which have to do less than ever to receive massive breaks," Whiten commented.

New Jersey has awarded more than $6 billion in subsidies since Governor Christie's tenure in office as a way to lower the cost of conducting business in the state.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Last week, New York state legislators passed a bill that makes businesses held accountable for tax incentives if they do not meet job creation goals. The bill is a significant development because the state tax incentives totaled <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/morning_call/2015/06/lawmakers-pass-bill-holding-companies-developers.html" target="_blank">$554 million last year</a>, a nine percent increase over 2013.
<h2>The new deal</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NY-bizness.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NY-bizness.gif" alt="businesses held accountable" width="399" height="399" /></a>The new law is expected to take effect within the next six months. Industrial development agencies play a key role in employment creation with tax breaks enabling these companies to relocate to New York state. These tax breaks and incentives are viewed as vital aspects of conducting business in New York state because they help companies offset other tax and utility expenses. Ultimately, the new law means that industrial development agencies in New York state will be required to create policies in the event of discontinuing tax breaks when a company halts operations, relocates or misses job creation and retention goals. Therefore, employers will now be held responsible for meeting the job creation goals they set in order to qualify for certain state business tax breaks.
<h2>Criticism</h2>
However, according to the New York State Comptroller's Office, these businesses and real estate development firms have established job creation goals for the tax breaks without following through on their promises. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli was critical of the system in place because it does not hold companies accountable for ensuring that they reach their specific quotas for job creation. The goal of the new legislation is to make these businesses and industrial development agencies more transparent. With more scrutiny in the process of industrial development agency project applications, DiNapoli feels that requiring agreements in the project will ensure that companies meet job creation goals. Otherwise, their tax incentives will be revoked and they will be responsible for the unpaid taxes. Ultimately, DiNapoli feels that the new legislation will increase the benefits of job creation.

"By increasing scrutiny of IDA project applications and requiring project agreements to include the recapture of benefits if job creation goals are not met, we can <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">address many of the concerns raised in audits</a> by my office over the years," noted DiNapoli.
<h2>The impact</h2>
The significance of the tax incentives was highlighted in the legislation, particularly in the Albany region. Albany was awarded 397 projects in 2014, with <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/morning_call/2015/06/lawmakers-pass-bill-holding-companies-developers.html" target="_blank">$93.7 million in tax exemptions</a>, more than any other region in the state. This included a series of recent major industrial development projects such as the $110 million restructuring of the Albany Medical Center.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Last week, the Internal Revenue Service issued a notice to announce that it will prohibit a cash-out window for Employee Retirement Income Security Act pension plans. The amendment to the ERISA pension plan de-risking strategy will prevent lump sum payments <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/pension-de-risking-gets-new-rules-irs-shuts-down-lump-sum-offers-to-retirees-while-c" target="_blank">in lieu of remaining annuity payments</a>.
<h2>The new ERISA de-risking strategy</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ERISA.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ERISA.gif" alt="de-risking strategy" width="400" height="400" /></a>The IRS announced in Notice 2015-49 that it will no longer allow lump sum cash-outs, a practice it previously permitted under several rulings. However, the IRS's new position will place limits on lump sum offers from employers' plans for participants who are not yet receiving distributions from pension plans covered by ERISA. In the notice, the IRS stated that lump sum cash-outs "undermine the intent" of the minimum required distribution regulations that prohibit accelerated annuity payments for pre-existing ERISA pension plans.

This notice represents a significant shift for the IRS, as it recently permitted lump sum cash-outs in private letter rulings for large sponsors, including Ford and General Motors.
<h2>A common de-risking strategy</h2>
Employers often provide voluntary lump sum cash-out options for current employees and retirees as a cost-effective method of <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=812843f1-5fcf-4fdc-b51e-e2a1d39d45b7" target="_blank">reducing pension risk</a> and reducing administrative costs. The buyout strategy is typically offered to pensioners during a company's financial restructuring period to avoid future funding risks arising from underperforming pension assets. A pension plan must have an assumed rate of return on plan assets and when performance falls below the assumed rate of return, the sponsor must increase its contribution to the plan. With the volatility and potential financial burden of tax-qualified defined benefit obligations for sponsors, employers look to de-risking strategies as a means of financial stability.
<h2>Opponents of the ERISA de-risking strategy</h2>
The IRS's new requirements follow a General Accounting Office report that found a significant number of de-risking disclosures for ERISA pension plan participants were deficient. This prompted criticism from the American Association of Retired Persons to limit ERISA de-risking strategies. The AARP noted that de-risking strategies may cause pensioners to lose their PBGC insurance protection and a significant amount of <a href="http://www.fa-mag.com/news/some-lump-sum-pension-buyouts-banned-22485.html" target="_blank">their retirement wealth</a>. According to Norman Stein, Senior Policy Advisor to the Pension Rights Center, these de-risking strategies eliminate federal private pension protections for ERISA.

"The offer of a lump sum can create considerable confusion and anxiety for older Americans, who are often not in a position to appreciate the risks they face and the losses they might suffer," Stein noted.
<h2>Impact</h2>
Following the amendment, the IRS now requires employers seeking to settle liabilities for retirees in ERISA pension plans to transfer the liabilities to a third-party insurance company. However, the amendment will permit other risk transfer strategies, including lump sum cash-outs already in progress.

Senator Ron Wyden noted that the new amendment is significant because lump sum cash-outs can jeopardize the ERISA pension plans for more than 44 million workers and retirees.

The irony is that businesses are criticized when they take too much risk, but when business attempts to reduce its risk, rule changes such as this one, prevent it.  Remember, General Motors and the City of Detroit went bankrupt because of legacy costs and I wonder if any retirees whose benefits were curtailed as a result wish they had taken a lump sum.

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Property Tax Rebate</h2>
Governor Andrew Cuomo recently announced that the <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/state/new-york-legislative-leaders-reach-deal-on-big-ugly-20150625" target="_blank">"Big Ugly"</a> $1.3 billion rebate check program will be installed to offset New York state property taxes. In accordance with the legislation, <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/state/index.ssf/2015/06/who_gets_a_185_check_in_nys_new_property_tax_rebate_program.html" target="_blank">2.5 million homeowners</a> that make under $500,000 will receive a property tax rebate check for $185 this year.
<h2>The bill</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/big-ugly.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/big-ugly.gif" alt="big ugly" width="400" height="400" /></a>According to the final agreement, property taxpayers that qualify for the Big Ugly rebate check program will receive the standard $185 check the first year, then have this amount scaled for the remaining three years depending on their location and income. However, the deal also involves a four-year extension of the property tax cap program with two new exclusion clauses including payments to the Board of Cooperative Educational Services and payments-in-lieu of taxes.
<h2>How it works</h2>
In order to qualify for the rebate program, the school district of the taxpayer must remain under the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">property tax</a> cap. However, the law was structured so that thousands of homeowners in the upstate region will receive the $185 rebate check in the first year, but by the second year of the program, qualifications for the rebate are based on a homeowners' School Tax Relief property tax savings. This means that taxpayers making under $75,000 will receive a rebate check for 28 percent of the value of the savings, while those making under $150,000 will receive a check for 20.5 percent.

Those who qualify for the program in the fourth year will see their rebate benefits increase. For example, those individuals who make less than $75,000 will receive 85 percent of the STAR savings, and 60 percent for those making under $150,000. Ultimately by the end of the final year, homeowners in these income brackets will receive $530 in tax rebates on average throughout the duration of the program.
<h2>The issues related to the program</h2>
The qualifications for homeowners change as each region has their own specific income threshold. For instance, in upstate New York, the income threshold to qualify for the rebate check program is $200,000, whereas this threshold is $275,000 on Long Island. The rebate program was not made available for property owners in New York City, although this region is expected to contribute to the tax pool for the program. There are also problems associated with check-mailing plans due to the fact that New York state spent $1.6 million to mail out four million refund checks.

All told, the Big Ugly bill will total $3.1 billion in rebates over four years, with $1.3 billion in the final year.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[Presidential contender, Hillary Clinton, announced a proposal for capital gains tax reform. In the plan, capital gains taxes will be increased for assets held for less than six years by top-bracket investors.
<h2>The proposed capital gains tax increase</h2>
<img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/capital-gains-taxes.gif" alt="capital gains taxes" width="403" height="403" />As part of her proposal, the top-ranking tax rate will be 43.8 percent for assets held less than one year, an increase from 39.6 percent. This rate will then be placed on a sliding scale until assets are held for a minimum of six years. These rates will include 39.6 percent from one to two years, 36 percent from two to three years, 32 percent from three to four years, 28 percent from four to five years and 24 percent from five to six years. Following this six-year mark, shareholders will be subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax rate.

This represents a significant increase from current tax rates, as only assets held for under one year are subject to the 39.6 percent tax rate, with each subsequent year at the 20 percent rate. This includes a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income as part of the Affordable Care Act.
<h2>The goal of the capital gains tax increase</h2>
According to Clinton's plan, the capital gains tax increase will stimulate long-term economic growth by changing the current tax code. This proposal also calls for a limit on subsidies into high performing industries as well as significant limitations on "hit and run" activist shareholders.

Clinton explained that the objective of the proposed tax increase is to fight short-term profits in capital markets. Citing a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/hillary-clinton-proposes-sharp-increase-in-short-term-capital-gains-taxes.html" target="_blank">recent FactSet survey</a>, Clinton stated that companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock market index spent $566 billion to buy back shares in 2014, representing an $86 billion increase from 2013, the highest since the recession.
<h2>Potential impact on profits</h2>
Under Clinton's proposal, shareholders would keep 56.6 percent on the additional dollar amount of the profit, as opposed to the current 80 percent. According to a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/hillary-clinton-proposes-sharp-increase-in-short-term-capital-gains-taxes.html" target="_blank">CNBC report</a>, this would mean shareholders at the top tax scale would be subject to the 43.8 percent rate as well as the 35 percent <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">corporate tax rate</a>.

However, according to the proposal, Clinton also included a capital gains tax break for long-term investments for start-up companies and struggling industries.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Last week, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that medical marijuana dispensaries cannot claim business expenses to the IRS as other commercial enterprises.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/medical-marjiuana.gif"><img class=" alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/medical-marjiuana.gif" alt="medical marijuana" width="399" height="399" /></a>According to Forbes, the decision is considered a financial setback for medical marijuana dispensaries because, with business deductions being disallowed, they must pay taxes on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml" target="_blank">100 percent</a> of their gross income. The decision is a blow to dispensaries across the country that have flourished in states that voted to legalize the use of medicinal marijuana.
<h2>The decision</h2>
In the case of Olive V. Comm., the Ninth Circuit upheld the federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank">tax law</a> to disallow tax deductions despite the legal status of dispensaries in California. According to Judge Susan Graber, the Court affirmed Sec. 280E of the federal tax code that denies deductions for the expenses of "trafficking in controlled substances." The ruling stated that a medical marijuana dispensary cannot deduct expenses from taxable income because their only commercial product is a controlled substance prohibited by federal law. Despite the various services offered by the taxpayer in the case, the Court ruled that since marijuana sales were the only activity in which the taxpayer engaged in with the "intent of realizing a profit", it was therefore a "trade or business" involved in trafficking a controlled substance, and thus not eligible for expense deduction.
<h2>The case</h2>
The case involved Martin Olive, owner and operator of the Vapor Room in San Francisco, who appealed a Tax Court ruling to deny his business expense deductions. In the appeal, Olive argued that Sec. 280E's use of the phrase "consists of" applied to the Vapor Room because it offered other services in addition to marijuana sales, thereby entitling the enterprise to expense deductions.

However, since these services were free, the Court ruled that all of the  $655,000 in business expenses from the Vapor Room between 2004 and 2005 were disallowed. The Court also rejected Olive's argument that the Vapor Room was entitled to deductions under Californians Helping to Alleviate Medical Problems, Inc. v. Comm, which allowed expense deductions related to sales of counseling and caregiving services. In that earlier case, the court held  that section 280E does not preclude petitioner from deducting expenses attributable to a trade or business other than that of illegal trafficking in controlled substances simply because petitioner also is involved in the trafficking in a controlled substance.  Judge Graber stated that the Vapor Room could not deduct any such expenses because the business did not charge for those services, and marijuana sales are not considered counseling and caregiving services.
<h2>Room for optimism</h2>
Although the ruling bans tax deductions for enterprises with marijuana sales as their sole source of revenue, dispensaries are eligible for standard business expense deductions for additional products for sale. In an interview with the SF Gate, Olive's lawyer Henry Wykowski noted that medical marijuana dispensaries <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Marijuana-dispensaries-can-t-deduct-business-6376047.php" target="_blank">can claim expenses from sales </a>of other commercial products, including food and services. The difficulty will be apportioning business expenses between the permissible activities and the impermissible activity

"The decision will benefit dispensaries that sell a variety of products including those that are not cannabis," explained Wykowski. "I don't think it's a blow to the industry at all."  However, the decision was not a "win."

A recent ABA Journal article reported on the application by a marijuana trade group for a Colorado state credit union charter because banks were unwilling to accept cash deposits from dispensaries.  It will be interesting to learn if that application is granted.

The topic of use of medical marijuana is growing traction through out the nation. As a business owner or as a user what are your thoughts on medical marijuana?]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Last week, the IRS passed stiffer penalties for inaccurate information found on any tax return filed after Dec. 31, 2015.</h2>
In the new legislation, penalties for inaccurate information on a tax return may have more than doubled for failure to file accurate information on returns or payee statements.

<strong>The new provision and penalties for inaccurate information on a tax return</strong>

<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/penalties-for-inaccurate-information.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/penalties-for-inaccurate-information.gif" alt="penalties for inaccurate information" width="401" height="401" /></a>The new rules mark the <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/411352/tax%20authorities/Congress%20Increases%20Information%20Return%20Penalties" target="_blank">second time since 2010 that Congress</a> has voted to increase the minimum penalties for inaccurate information under Section 6721(b) and per-employer penalty caps under Section 6722(b) for an inaccurate or un-filed tax return. However, this provision was significant because it was passed in a revenue increase, rather than a tax bill, as part of the Trade Preference Extension Act of 2015. These penalties for inaccurate information will also be imposed under Code sections 6721 and 6722 retroactive to 2015 tax returns.

<strong>Stiffer penalties for inaccurate information</strong>

The previous penalties for inaccurate information on a tax return for both sections 6721 and 6722 are $100 for each return, and up to $1.5 million for each year. However, under the new provision, the penalties will increase to $250 for each erroneous tax return, and up to $3 million per year. Although there are ways to reduce the penalties if  a tax return is amended within 30 days after filing. The penalty is now reduced by $50 per inaccurate return if corrective actions are taken within 30 days, and a threshold of $500,000. This is a significant change as the previous penalty reduction was $30 per return with a $250,000 threshold. This benefit increases to $60 per return if corrective actions are taken on erroneous returns within 30 days, but before Aug. 1, 2015. These reductions extend for erroneous returns with a threshold of $1.5 million as the amount per return increases to $100 if corrective actions are made by Aug. 1. Finally, for gross receipts with a threshold of $5 million, the new legislation allows a reduction between $250 to $500 for cases of unintentional error.
<h2>The tax forms to be penalized</h2>
The new penalties for inaccurate information under Sections 6721 and 6722 are Forms 1099 "Miscellaneous Income", 1098 "Mortgage Interest Statement", 1097 "Bond Tax Credit", W-2 "Wage and Tax Statement", W-2G "Certain Gambling Winnings" and 5498 "IRA Contribution Information". Although taxpayers need to be aware that these new penalties apply to both total income reported and information returns for a variety of gross proceeds, including mortgage interest statements, payments subject to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act as well as various information returns required under the Affordable Care Act. However, under Section 6724, the IRS does allow certain penalties to be abated if the failure to submit accurate information is the result of reasonable cause.
<h2>Criticism of the new penalties</h2>
According to <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/increase-information-reporting-penalties-w-21099-errors" target="_blank">The National Law Review</a>, due to the fact that the new penalties apply to the copy of the form filed with the IRS and the copy filed with an employee, the penalties for inaccurate information are not only more strict, they impact more <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">taxpayers</a>. These new penalties will now also apply to inaccurate tax returns before 2015 if they are discovered this year, or if the corrective actions are taken after 2015.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The Treasury Department proposed new regulations that may impose limitations on transfer tax savings for corporate, partnership and limited liability company agreement provisions between family members.</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/transfer-tax-savings.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/transfer-tax-savings.gif" alt="transfer tax savings" width="401" height="401" /></a>The proposed regulations by the Treasury Department may place limitations on the availability of discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability on ownership of transfer tax savings to family members of closely-held businesses. According to a <a href="http://www.hklaw.com/Publications/New-Treasury-Regulations-May-Limit-Transfer-Tax-Savings-07-28-2015/#sthash.d3o6YcxB.dpuf" target="_blank">report from Holland &amp; Knight</a>, these provisions have the potential to adversely impact the valuations of these transfers.

The concern over the potential restrictions came after recent comments by Cathy Hughes, estate and gift tax attorney advisor in the Office of Tax Policy at the U.S. Treasury Department, hinted that certain provisions in transfers of business interests would be subject to for tax purposes. According to Hughes, "applicable restrictions" in governing documents for family-controlled entities would be disregarded for transfer tax purposes in the valuation of transfers for family-owned business interests among family members. Therefore, transfer taxes would take precedent over certain agreed-upon provisions, meaning that most transfers of business interests in family-owned entities would be subject to tax.

<strong>Current Treasury Department regulations for transfer tax savings</strong>

This change could be significant because under current transfer tax savings regulations, certain interests in privately-owned companies are valued using discounts.  The current standard is the price that a willing buyer and seller would pay, with neither one being compelled to buy or sell and each having an equal knowledge of the facts.  A buyer would not pay a price equal to the pro rata value of the assets in the business because the buyer could not control management decisions, withdraw funds or readily liquidate his or her interest.  These factors for the lack of control and marketability result in lower valuations for transfers of certain shares in a closely held corporation or membership  interests in a limited liability company.

Valuation discounts are important for family-owned businesses because they accurately reflect the value of the specific ownership interest, which cannot easily be sold or disposed. These discounts illustrate what a buyer in an arm's length transaction would pay for an ownership interest. Discounts reduce the value of the interest and thereby reduces the transfer tax imposed on a gift of the interest.

A discount for lack-of-control may be applied to non-voting shares or interest to voting shares or an that does not have control. Further, a discount for the lack of marketability also helps non-publicly traded businesses because ownership  interests are not traded on a securities exchange and are, therefore, not liquid. Finally, closely-held enterprises often prohibit transfer without consent of the other owners and this further reduces the value of the ownership interest.

<strong>Takeaway</strong>

While it is not certain whether the proposed regulations from the Treasury Department will cover all family-owned businesses, Holland &amp; Knight propose that it may be prudent for CEOs <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">considering a gift or sale of their family-owned business interests</a> to <a href="http://www.hklaw.com/Publications/New-Treasury-Regulations-May-Limit-Transfer-Tax-Savings-07-28-2015/" target="_blank">expedite the completion of the transaction</a>. Although Hughes did not indicate an effective date for the new regulations, the Treasury Department hinted that the regulations could be made final as soon as September 2015.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week, the New York Division of Tax Appeals ruled that the New York Division of Taxation did not have the right to impose a non-resident income tax. This income tax against Patrick J. Carr, a nonresident lawyer, was voided because he is licensed to practice in New York. In the case, the Court ruled that Patrick J. Carr was not required to pay a <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/685285/ny-law-license-doesn-t-allow-ny-to-tax-atty-s-fla-work" target="_blank"><span class="s1">$68,260 tax bill from the NY Division of Taxation</span></a>.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The Division of Taxation imposes hefty non-resident income tax bill</b></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NY-non-resident-income-tax.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NY-non-resident-income-tax.gif" alt="NY non-resident income tax" width="403" height="403" /></a>The NY Division of Taxation aggressively enforces residency income audits on non-residents to ensure that they have properly changed their domicile. However, a recent case against the Florida-based lawyer, Patrick J. Carr, may result in the Division of Taxation changing its auditing rules regarding a non-resident income tax.</p>
<p class="p1">Carr was licensed to practice law in New York and New Jersey, but had retired to Florida. However, the NY Division of Taxation took exception to the fact that he continued to practice in Florida. This caused the Division of Taxation to audit Carr's residency to determine if he had legally changed his domicile. Then, after conducting the audit, the Division of Taxation concluded that since Carr's income was attributable to his licensure in New York state under <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Tax Law</span></a> article 22, Section 631, all of his income was subject to New York income tax.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Court rejects NY Division of Taxation's claim</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Although Carr is not licensed to practice law in the State of Florida, he was <a href="http://www.taxanalysts.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-9YXQ2U?OpenDocument" target="_blank"><span class="s1">admitted pro hac vice</span></a> in the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit in Sarasota County, Florida. This pro hac vice status meant that Carr was given special permission to provide legal services on a specific case, despite the fact that he was not licensed in the state. Therefore, in the ruling, Administrative Law Judge Barbara J. Russo explained that the Division of Taxation could not "assert tax merely based on a New York license," deeming the claim meritless and inconsistent with New York state tax regulations and judiciary laws.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Non-residents exempt from NY state income tax</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The ruling was significant because it established a precedent for all nonresidents of New York state. Russo explained that non-residents who do not earn revenue or perform work or services in New York state, are not subject to state income tax, even if their profession is attributable to the state of New York.</p>
<p class="p1">What is unclear is whether other states will use the decision to tax the income in their state because it is not taxable in New York.  Florida, which does not have an individual income tax, may not benefit from the decision but others states, facing deficits, may be more aggressive. Taxpayers should recognize that states may have different rules to source the place where income is earned. The two most common rules are the place of performance of services (e.g. contract research) or where the recipient obtaining the benefit of the service is located.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The U.S. Tax Court recently issued a surprising decision that invalidated the part of an IRS cost-sharing regulation - under code section 482 - which states that taxpayers are required to take the costs of stock-based compensation into account.</h2>
<p class="p1">The decision regarding the cost-sharing regulation supports taxpayer criticism that questioned the regulatory requirement that cost-based transfer pricing must include the cost of stock-based compensation.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cost-sharing.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cost-sharing.gif" alt="cost-sharing" width="405" height="405" /></a><b>The case</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In <i>Altera Corporation v. Commissioner</i>, the Tax Court held that <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tax-court-overturns-important-transfer-pricing-regulations" target="_blank"><span class="s1">section 482 is invalid</span></a>. Therefore, taxpayers who are parties to cost-sharing arrangements with foreign affiliates can continue to share costs associated with research and development without allocating stock based compensation in the manner required by the regulation and the Service.</p>
<p class="p1">The IRS argued that Altera should not have been able to object that the regulations are inconsistent with the "arm's length standard" as they are part of an "elective" regulatory regime for cost-sharing. However, the Court struck down this argument to recharacterize relevant provisions as "elective" by explaining that the IRS rejected taxpayers' suggestions in the regulatory process to make this provision a true safe harbor. The Court noted that Treasury failed to make a connection between the choice it made in drafting the regulation and the facts it found.  Thus, the decision to adopt this regulation was held to be arbitrary and capricious.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The significance of the decision</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The Tax Court's decision is significant beyond cost-sharing and stock-based compensation costs because the IRS can no longer issue a valid transfer pricing regulation under the "arm's length standard." With this standard, the IRS previously attempted to interpret how related parties "should behave" in the absence of evidence that unrelated parties behave in that fashion. Therefore, despite the fact that the "arm's length standard" does not appear in section 482, previous decisions upheld that the regulation incorporated this standard. However with this decision, the IRS' ability to reallocate among affiliates is significantly limited.</p>
<p class="p1">The decision is also important because the Court took a<strong> novel approach in its review of the cost-sharing regulation.</strong> Therefore, if the decision is upheld, it could lead to more successful challenges from taxpayers to IRS regulations.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Takeaway</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Taxpayers will have choices going forward if the IRS does not agree to comply with the decision and eliminate stock-based compensation stipulations under section 482. These taxpayers who take advantage of the costs of stock-based compensation in the contexts of cost-sharing and transfer pricing will have the option to continue to rely on the regulation. For instance, if a foreign company with significant stock-based compensation costs provides services or goods to an affiliate in the U.S., that entity can continue to rely on the regulations. However, taxpayers who do not benefit from cost-sharing and transfer pricing are now eligible to do so under the existing regulation.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The NJ Division of Taxation establishes these guidelines for Corporate Business Tax.</h2>
<p class="p1">The recent Technical Bulletin issued by the NJ Division of Taxation established a final set of nexus guidelines for activities that subject a company to the corporate business tax. These new nexus guidelines include a detailed description of activities that are outside the protection of Public Law 86-272 for in-state companies, according to a Wolters Kluwer report on the Technical Bulletin.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nexus-guidelines.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nexus-guidelines.gif" alt="nexus guidelines" width="400" height="400" /></a><b>The corporation business nexus guidelines</b></h2>
<p class="p1">All domestic or nonresident corporations are required to pay an annual franchise tax for various privileges that stem from a nexus in the state, as listed in the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act. The way this works is that if a foreign company has a nexus in New Jersey, meaning that it has a significant physical presence in the state, it is subject to the corporation business tax. This law now encompasses privileges for companies with a nexus in New Jersey, including exercising a corporate franchise, deriving receipts from revenue sources, communicating or engaging with contacts and conducting business - which includes having employees, owning capital or property and maintaining an office in the state.</p>
<p class="p1">The same rules apply to foreign business with a corporate franchise in New Jersey, except for two addendums. If the foreign company is registered with the New Jersey Department of Revenue, and if the business has authorization issued by a New Jersey government department or agency to engage in corporate activities in the state.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Determinants of a corporate business nexus within the state</b></h2>
<p class="p1">There are several qualifications that determine whether a business qualifies as having a nexus in New Jersey. These classifications pertain to the nature and extent of business activities, the office and business locations and the continuity and frequency of activities in the state. The corporate business <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s1">tax law</span></a> also evaluates the employment of agents, officers and employees within New Jersey state limits, as well as the location of the actual seat of executive management and/or the individuals in control of the corporation.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Net income tax exemptions for foreign corporations under Public Law 86-272</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The state of New Jersey adheres to Public Law 86-272, also known as the Federal Interstate Income Act. This federal law prohibits any state from the imposition of a tax based on the net income a foreign business earned from interstate commerce. Further, the law explains that a foreign company is exempt from a net income-based tax if its only business activities in a state are to solicit orders of tangible personal property, and then have these orders sent outside the state's borders to be filled for shipment or delivery.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Exceeding the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act</b></h2>
<p class="p1">However, there are certain business activities that exceed the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act. For instance, the NJ Division of Taxation clarified in the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act that if a foreign company conducts business activities in the state that qualify it as having a nexus within the state, it is subject to the corporation business tax that is determined by the net income of the company - not simply the net income earned within the state of New Jersey. This is significant because that foreign company is subject to the corporate business tax due to a nexus in the state, <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tb/tb79r.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s1">even if its activities are protected</span></a> by the Federal Interstate Income Act.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Specific business activities not protected under Public Law 86-272</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The activities of foreign companies that create a nexus in New Jersey include repairs, installations, maintenance, property collections or repossessions, credit investigations and providing technical support. These business activities also involve conducting training events of any kind for employees and company personnel, consigning tangible personal property, picking up damaged or returned property and maintaining facilities in the state. Further activities outside of the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act encompass accepting orders or securing deposits on sales, personnel acquisitions for purposes other than solicitation, maintaining displays at in-state locations for longer than two weeks, distributing or exchanging samples for sales solicitation and resolving customer complaints for purposes other than to position sales employees to curry favor with the customer.</p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/life-insurance-policy-control.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/life-insurance-policy-control.gif" alt="life insurance policy control" width="403" height="403" /></a>However, according to a recent ruling by the U.S. Tax Court, investors who exercise control over how money is invested are subject to tax on the investment income. This case was significant because it is seen as a landmark victory for the IRS in how the income from variable life insurance and annuities policies are taxed. This negates the perceived tax-advantaged benefits of such policies, and thus, life insurance policy control is shifted.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b><i>Webber v. Commissioner</i></b></h2>
<p class="p1">In the case, Jeffrey T. Webber purchased a single premium life insurance policy on his aunt. The issuer then deposited the balance into a segregated fund to reinsure the annual risk. Webber then advised the fund manager over several years to invest the money in publicly traded stocks and private investments in which he was involved or knew to be value investments. In turn, the fund manager followed all the suggestions and invested the money in accordance with Webber's advice. As a result, the IRS ruled that Webber was subject to tax on the income generated in the segregated fund because while he did not have the legal right to provide recommendations on how to invest the money, the fund manager followed Webber's orders.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The Tax Court ruling</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In the decision, the court upheld the IRS assertion by applying the investor control doctrine <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=790ee4d2-ec60-4b3e-97b8-91fe3298f46e" target="_blank"><span class="s1">evidenced in Rev. Rul. 77-85</span></a>. This meant that if Webber exercised control over how the money was invested in the fund, he must then be considered the owner of the fund and the income in it.</p>
<p class="p1">Previously, Congress had issued insurance tax rules that asserted the investor control doctrine. The way this worked was that the tax code imposed limitations on the level of influence that policy owners could contribute to their variable insurance and annuity contracts. It also required policy investment diversification. However, with the decision, the court ruled that Webber bypassed these limitations because while the fund was diversified, the fund manager invested in private funds that he or she would not have known about without Webber's recommendations.</p>
<p class="p1">In rendering its holding, the court rejected Webber's argument that the investor control doctrine applied solely to annuities, and not life insurance policies. Further, the court rejected his argument that he should not be subject to tax on the "<a href="http://www.meadowscollier.com/?t=40&amp;an=41778&amp;format=xml&amp;p=7664" target="_blank"><span class="s1">inside buildup"</span></a> since he was not in constructive receipt of the investment earnings. Therefore, the court drew a distinction in investor control, asserting that it is a separate doctrine that addresses a different area, and not applicable to constructive receipt.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The significance</b></h2>
<p class="p1"><strong><i>Webber v. Commission</i> marks the first ruling on investors and life insurance policy control in more than 30 years</strong>, but it also poses a material threat to owners of life insurance and annuity policies. If holders exert control over variable life insurance and annuity policies, then they assume control over the investments inside the policy. Thus, holders are taxed on the current investment income because they lose the deferral or elimination of tax on the inside buildup.</p>
<p class="p1">What this means for policy holders is that they need to assess their level of influence on their investments to ensure that the <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">tax-deferred benefits</a> of the policy are not in jeopardy based on the investor control doctrine or the Webber decision.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance recently issued a Technical Memorandum to finalize 2015 legislative amendments to NY estate tax reform. The provisions enacted in 2014 will be effective retroactive to April 1, 2015.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NY-estate-tax-reform.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NY-estate-tax-reform.gif" alt="NY estate tax reform" width="397" height="397" /></a>The basic NY estate tax reform: exclusion amount increases</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In the Technical Memorandum, the Department of Taxation and Finance stated that the basic estate tax exclusion amount will increase on an escalating scale each year till January 1, 2019 until it corresponds with the federal estate tax exemption amount. These increases will be phased in for NY residents and non-residents who own, or who have owned, real property located within NY state retroactive to April 1, 2014.</p>
<p class="p1">Under the previous estate tax exclusion amount, estates with <a href="http://www.binghamtonlaw.com/library/news-media/NY-Estate-Tax-Changes-050614.pdf"><span class="s1">less than $1,000,000</span></a> were exempt from NY estate tax, well below the Federal exemption of $5,340,000. However with the new law, the NY exclusion amount has <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=57c57835-df06-4d23-bdd5-c1130a45b8ae"><span class="s1">increased to $2,062,500</span></a>, effective April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. Likewise, this exemption amount is set to increase to $3,125,000 from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. The exclusion amount rises further from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 to $4,187,500. However, the cut-off changes as the deadline will be from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, although the exclusion amount will increase to $5,250,000. Finally, on January 1, 2019, the basic estate tax exclusion amount will correlate to the Federal exemption total of $5,340,000.</p>
<p class="p1">It is important to note that the Dept of Taxation and Finance set $5,000,000 to be indexed for inflation retroactive to 2010.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>NY state clarifies that gifts eligible to be added back to descendent estate</b></h2>
<p class="p1">For NY residents, taxable gifts they provide within three years prior to their death, with a tax exclusion threshold of $14,000 annually per donee, will be added back to the descendent's estate. This applies to gifts made between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018. The Technical Memorandum also clarified that gifts composed of real and tangible personal property located outside NY state will not be added back to the gross estate of the descendent. Further, gifts are unable to be added back to the gross estate of the donor if he or she dies on or after January 1, 2019.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Federal deductions of intangible personal property for estates of non-residents not allowed</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Finally, the Technical Memorandum stated that for non-residents who die on or after April 1, 2014, the computation of a New York taxable estate will not include any intangible personal property otherwise subject to taxation in the gross estate. The federal deduction for this intangible personal property will not be allowed in the computation of NY state estate tax for a non-resident. So for estate executors of a non-resident who died between April 2, 2014 and March 30, 2015, but filed an NY state estate tax return with the federal deduction, they will need to re-file an amended return.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Benefits of the new NY estate tax reform</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The Department of Taxation and Finance emphasized that there will be no state estate tax imposed on a non-resident if the value of the real and tangible personal property in New York is under the $3,125,000 estate tax exemption threshold in the year of the individual's death.</p>
<p class="p1">Thus, a New York resident would do well to make gifts of real and tangible personal property located outside New York state as a hedge against state tax imposed upon him or her before January 1, 2019.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Power shifts in trustee material participation</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trustee-material-participation.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trustee-material-participation.gif" alt="trustee material participation" width="400" height="400" /></a>Taxpayer victories in <em>Maggie K. Carter Trust v. U.S.</em> and <em>Frank Aragona Trust v. Commissioner</em>  were hailed as opportunities for taxpayers to structure real estate ownership by trusts in a manner that would attribute management activity to the trustee.

The result of this trustee material participation was the 3.8% additional tax on Net Investment Income under §1411 (NII) being rendered inapplicable. The trust, through the activity of the trustee, was deemed to materially participate thereby converting passive income into active income and avoiding the 3.8% NII, also known as the Obama Tax.

Trustee material participation must be regular, continuous and substantial involvement in the operations of the company in order to avoid NII. In simplified form, it is direct involvement in regular management activity.
<h2>Constituents of the new trustee material participation</h2>
Subsequently, IRS issued Taxpayer Advisory Memorandum (TAM) 201317010, which stated that the activity of a special trustee could not be attributed to two trusts. The special trustee of two trusts was also a shareholder and president of the corporation in which the trusts owned stock. As special trustee, he was given the power to vote the stock owned by the trust. The corporation employed the special trustee as an individual, ostensibly to manage the affairs of the trust in the hope of securing material participation. There was a gap in the evidence that the individual was acting for the trusts and had actually performed work on their behalf. In these matters, the IRS distinguishes between investor work, such as oversight and voting on major decisions, and managing the daily affairs of the company.

Planning approaches have been developed to address IRS concerns. One solution is to have the real estate owned by a limited liability company (LLC) and retain the trust as manager. However, the trustee material participation would still be engaged in regular, continuous and substantial management of the enterprise. A second approach is for the trust to form an LLC that is wholly owned by the trust. The trust and trustee could contract to provide more than 100 hours of service (significant participation) that re-characterizes passive income as non-passive and avoid the 3.8% tax or to provide more than 500 hours to re-characterize all income and loss as non-passive.

A third approach, applicable to corporations, deals with the ability under state law to dispense with the Board of Directors and pass the duties to shareholders. Known as a “Close Corporation,” the law of the state of incorporation must be examined with regard as to what is needed to qualify. The third approach would have the shareholders, including the trust, run the business and serve as officers and participate in a regular, continuous and substantial way.
<h2>Other obstacles for trustee material participation</h2>
Although the above explanation may seem straight forward, there are other hurdles. Opening a bank account can be a slow and painful process at the retail level. Insurance coverage may also be an issue because the trustee may be a professional and it is a concern if he or she is acting outside the scope of coverage provided by errors and omissions policy. Title insurance is another issue and the availability of an imputation endorsement is important. Finally, make certain <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">the tax preparer</a> understands what you are doing in why so there are no surprises when the income tax returns are prepared.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that unmarried individuals who purchased a home together are eligible to a home mortgage interest deduction for <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Tax-ruling-a-win-for-unmarried-people-who-own-a-6436357.php" target="_blank">up to </a><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Tax-ruling-a-win-for-unmarried-people-who-own-a-6436357.php" target="_blank">$1.1 million in debt</a> each</span>. This decision reversed a previous tax court decision that stated unmarried individuals were subject to the same $1.1 million limitation as married couples, thus splitting the deduction to $550,000 each.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Home-Mortgage-Interest-Deduction.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Home-Mortgage-Interest-Deduction.gif" alt="home mortgage interest deduction" width="401" height="401" /></a>The home mortgage interest deduction guidelines</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In previous decisions, the tax court and the IRS held that Sec.162(h)(3) applied to any two individuals that owned a home together, even if they did not jointly file tax returns. This home mortgage interest deduction threshold applies to mortgage interest up to $1 million in home-acquisition debt and up to $100,000 in home-equity debt on a qualified residence. The IRS deems a qualified residence as either a primary home or a residence in addition to a primary residence.</p>
<p class="p1">The way this works is that the $1.1 million home mortgage interest deduction applies strictly to an individual taxpayer. However, married couples file jointly, which provides them with treatment as an individual taxpayer by the IRS. So under Sec.162(h)(3), a married couple can only deduct their mortgage interest up to the $1.1 million total of the debt limit.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The point of contention </b></h2>
<p class="p1">The court argued that Sec.162(h)(3) did not specifically state how the debt limit applied to unmarried individuals who own a residence together. Similarly, the court stated that the code also did not clearly define whether the $1.1 million deduction limit for unmarried co-owners is applicable for a qualified residence, regardless of the number of owners. Therefore, there is no distinction drawn as to whether the limit of the debt can be claimed by any individual taxpayer.</p>
<p class="p1">The court also cited the fact that the IRS did not determine how the debt limit applied to unmarried co-owners of a property until it issued a chief counsel advisory in 2009. With this advisory, the IRS ruled that the debt limit applied on a per-residence basis, and not a per-taxpayer basis. However, the court deemed that a chief counsel advisory was not an authority, thus the debt limit has no clear designation for unmarried co-owners.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The case</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The case involved Bruce Voss and Charles Sophy, co-owners of a property who each claimed a home mortgage interest deduction of $1.1 million under Section 163(h)(3). However, the IRS split the deduction between Voss and Sophy at $550,000 each because they co-owned the property, thereby significantly limiting the amount of their deductions.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The decision</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The court reversed the tax court decision, finding the mortgage debt limit provision in the tax code applies on a per-taxpayer basis except in the case of married individuals.  This makes each member of the couple eligible to the homeowner mortgage interest deduction for up to the $1.1 million limit.</p>
<p class="p1">Following the decision, the IRS is still eligible to suspend these cases and not issue refunds for amended returns filed while the statute of limitations remains open. Further, if refunds are issued, the IRS may seek to recover these funds if the Supreme Court reverses this decision in the future.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The IRS recently issued a final private letter ruling that held that a principal of a business could deduct the amount of money paid as restitution in a business crime plea deal. This ruling was significant because while Sec. 162(f) states that no fines or penalties paid for violation of a law are tax deductible, Sec. 162(b)(2) provides that compensatory damages paid to any entity <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201528026.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s1">do not constitute a fine or penalty</span></a>.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/restitution.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/restitution.gif" alt="restitution" width="400" height="400" /></a>The case</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In this case, the taxpayer was the principal of his company and was compensated for his work on a particular sale. The U.S. prosecuted the company for the sale of its products and services and the taxpayer pleaded guilty to two criminal counts and was sentenced to incarceration, probation and a fine as a result. However, the taxpayer then entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S., for which he agreed to pay restitution to the government.</p>
<p class="p1">The court then found that the taxpayer owed four times the amount in question in restitution, and the government incurred three times that amount in real losses. Further, the restitution judgment was imposed separately from punitive sentence, which meant that the restitution judgment was intended to pay the government, and not part of the punitive damages. Therefore, the taxpayer did not receive indemnification for the restitution payments.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>The ruling</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The court concluded that the taxpayer's restitution payments were tax deductible because the payment was not part of the punitive fine, and thus a business expense. In its decision, the court determined that the facts indicated that the restitution was intended to compensate the government for its actual losses. Then, for the taxpayer's conduct, he was sentenced to imprisonment with a fine. So the court determined that since the restitution ruling and the sentence were made independent of one another at different times, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201528026.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s1">the payments were not part of the fine</span></a> under Sec. 162(f).</p>
<p class="p1">A second issue of contention for the court was the distinction between business expenses and personal expenditures as determined in <i>United States v. Gilmore</i>. In <i>Gilmore</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that since the payments were the result of criminal activities related to the taxpayer's business, the ruling did not impact the personal wealth of the taxpayer. Therefore, it was clear that the illegal activities were within the normal course of business functions, regardless if they violated a law.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New Jersey Division of Taxation Regulatory Services Branch recently issued a Technical Bulletin regarding the guidelines that create a nexus in the state and subject an individual to the sales and use tax. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nexus.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nexus.gif" alt="nexus" width="400" height="400" /></a>This Technical Bulletin comes in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision which held that a person must have an established physical presence in a state before that state's government can impose sales tax, as stated in the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey defined activities that create a nexus as an individual with a physical presence in the state that <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tb/tb78r.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">sells taxable items and services</span></a>. This individual must then register with the New Jersey Department of Revenue, whereupon the person is required to collect and remit sales tax when the items sold are delivered to a location within state borders, or if the act of the sale itself was performed in New Jersey.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Activities that create a nexus in New Jersey</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Activities that trigger a nexus in New Jersey include the sale, leasing or renting of tangible personal property as well as digital products and services. Further, if an individual maintains an office, warehouse, service enterprise or other place of business. These activities also involve having personnel within state borders to include any employees, independent contractors, agents and representatives. An individual may also be subject to the sales and use tax if the person sells, stores, delivers or transports energy to customers. Finally, various other activities include parking or storing motor vehicles, delivering goods sold in the seller's own vehicle and collecting membership fees for health, fitness, athletic, sporting, or shopping club property or facilities.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>E-commerce sales and use tax exemption</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under N.J.S.A. 54:32B-2(i)(1), a rebuttable presumption is created that a foreign seller who makes taxable sale of tangible personal property, specified digital products or services is soliciting business in New Jersey. Therefore, the person has created a nexus in New Jersey if the seller enters into an agreement with a resident of New Jersey, who is an independent contractor and/or representative for compensation in exchange for referrals. The customer referrals to a foreign seller may be made via a website link or other means. The next condition is that the foreign seller has more than $10,000 in sales revenue from these referrals to customers in New Jersey for the prior four quarterly periods ending March, June, September and December.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the foreign seller meets both of these requirements, the person has created a nexus because he or she is presumed to be soliciting business within the state boundaries of New Jersey. The seller must then register with the NJ Department of Revenue to collect and remit the sales tax on all taxable sales delivered in New Jersey.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Significance of the Technical Bulletin</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the presumption of a nexus is rebuttable, the foreign seller is eligible to provide proof that the independent contractor and/or representative did not solicit business on the seller's behalf in New Jersey. Therefore, the burden of proof is on the seller to provide a detailed explanation as to why he or she is not subject to the state sales and use tax.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In light of the state budget woes and pension deficit, this revision is not unexpected. Although consumers may resent the imposition of sales tax on purchases that escaped tax, one sees the benefit to local retailers who have complained for years about being disadvantaged. Unfortunately for local retailers and the state, the grasp of the new rule can be avoided by using non-New Jersey sources fro referrals.</span></p>]]></content>

The ruling is significant because it creates potential conflict between state and federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax laws</span></a>. However, it could also cause confusion for corporate taxpayers in other states that require companies to file separate tax returns. New Jersey requires corporations to file separate corporate income tax returns despite filing as part of a consolidated group for federal income tax purposes. This disconnect between federal and New Jersey taxation is a significant irritant to many.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MCI.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MCI.gif" alt="MCI" width="400" height="400" /></a>The background of the case</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2002, Worldcom filed a petition for reorganization <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/MCI_Commcn_Servs_Inc_v_Dir_Div_of_Taxation_No_0139052010_2015_BL_" target="_blank"><span class="s2">under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code</span></a>, according to a Bloomberg Law report. Upon emerging from bankruptcy, Worldcom merged with MCI Group in 2004, the parent company of MCI Communications Services Inc. (the "Taxpayer"). As a result of the bankruptcy, much of the indebtedness was forgiven, resulting in cancelation of indebtedness income ("COD").  The discharge in bankruptcy allowed MCI to avoid recognizing COD provided MCI reduced its tax attributes, such as net operating losses and basis in assets, to offset the COD for tax purposes. Where a parent company, such as MC Group, has insufficient tax attributes to offset COD, some of the COD is passed down to its subsidiary, in this case, the Taxpayer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whereupon the Taxpayer had the $271 million in COD income passed down to it to help MCI Group. The subsidiary tried to claim the amount as a corporate business deduction. However, the NJ Division of Taxation disallowed the deduction, which prompted the Taxpayer to appeal the decision.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Tax Court passes down its decision in favor of the NJ Division of Taxation</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a Law 360 report, the Tax Court ruled that the Taxpayer was not eligible to write off <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/683675/nj-tax-panel-nixes-mci-271m-business-deduction" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$271 million of cancelation of debt income</span></a> on its state taxes. The Court disallowed the deduction due to the fact that MCI Group included the cancelation of debt income amount in income calculations on a consolidated federal return for the parent company and its subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its decision, the Court cited that New Jersey requires each corporate entity with activity within state borders to file separate corporate business tax returns. However, because the Taxpayer was a subsidiary of a corporate entity that filed a consolidated income tax return for federal income tax purposes, the Taxpayer must file its state corporate business tax return using the net income of the Taxpayer as it appeared on the consolidated federal income tax return. The court rejected the Taxpayer's other arguments, the first of which was that taxpayer attribute reduction required by consolidated return rules did not apply in the context of a separate state return. Second, the attribute reduction would cause the taxpayer to recognize income in circumstances where the taxpayer's investment capital is being returned to it rather than income.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Court claims that the cancelation of debt income exclusion is inapplicable to NJ</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court claimed that while federal law allows the income from cancelation of debts occurring in bankruptcy to be excluded for tax purposes, New Jersey does not draw such distinctions that apply to the COD income exclusion. Therefore, the Court cited the fact that the federal exclusion of COD income by the Taxpayer was not applicable in New Jersey. The Court cited New Jersey's tax statutes that claimed that taxpayers are required to include the taxable income reported on federal returns as the basis for New Jersey's entire net income reported on state corporate business tax returns. The Court noted that the Taxpayer filed as part of a consolidated return with MCI Group, which means it was subject to New Jersey tax based upon the income reported in the consolidated return. The Taxpayer's consent, to be included in the consolidated return for federal tax purposes, permitted the state to require that the Taxpayer use the income attributed to it on the federal consolidated return as the basis for state taxation.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The potential significance of the decision</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The repercussions of this case are potentially massive, as 18 states currently ban consolidated reporting for tax purposes. However, more locally to New Jersey, the ruling blurs the state Division of Taxation's previous guidance on corporate business taxes. This was due to the fact that the starting point for calculating entire net income on state returns was previously a separate company tax return, and not its federal consolidated return.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further, the decision creates the potential for uncertainties regarding the types of income and expenses that are required to be included under "entire net income."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision is disappointing because the tax community believed the starting point for corporate taxable income had always been separate income, not consolidated income. The message for businesses is that there are 18 states that require separate reporting and the state tax impact of a bankruptcy discharge does not walk in lockstep with the treatment for federal purposes. Some consideration before filing bankruptcy must be given by parent corporations as to whether its subsidiaries should be excluded from the federal consolidated return in order to avoid harsh state tax consequences.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Restitution payments are now tax deductible</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/restitution.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/restitution.gif" alt="restitution" width="399" height="399" /></a>The IRS recently issued a final private letter ruling which held that a principal of a business could deduct the amount of money paid as restitution in a business crime plea deal. This ruling was significant because while Sec. 162(f) states that no fines or penalties paid for violation of a law are tax deductible, Sec. 162(b)(2) provides that compensatory damages paid to any entity <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201528026.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">do not constitute a fine or penalty</span></a>. </span><span class="s3">Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.162-21(b)(2) provides that a fine or penalty includes an amount paid in settlement of a taxpayer’s actual or potential liability in a civil or criminal matter. The same regulation provides that compensatory damages paid to the government do not constitute a fine or penalty.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The case</b>
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this case, the taxpayer was the principal of his company and was compensated for his work on a particular sale. The U.S. prosecuted the company for the sale of its products and services and the taxpayer pleaded guilty to two criminal counts and was sentenced to incarceration, probation and a fine as a result. However, the taxpayer then entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S., for which he agreed to pay restitution to the government.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court then found that the taxpayer owed four times the amount in question in restitution, and the government incurred three times that amount in real losses. Further, the restitution judgment was imposed separately from punitive sentence, which meant that the restitution judgment was intended to pay the government, and not part of the punitive damages. Therefore, the taxpayer did not receive indemnification for the restitution payments.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The ruling</b>
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court concluded that the taxpayer's restitution payments were tax deductible because the payment was not part of the punitive fine, and thus a business expense. In its decision, the court determined that the facts indicated that the restitution was intended to compensate the government for its actual losses. Then, for the taxpayer's conduct, he was sentenced to imprisonment with a fine. So the court determined that since the restitution ruling and the sentence were made independent of one another at different times, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201528026.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">the payments were not part of the fine</span></a> under Sec. 162(f).</span><span class="s3"> The independence of these events is significant to obtaining the deduction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A second issue of contention for the court was the distinction between business expenses and personal expenditures as determined in <i>United States v. Gilmore</i>. In <i>Gilmore</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that since the payments were the result of criminal activities related to the taxpayer's business, the ruling did not impact the personal wealth of the taxpayer. Therefore, it was clear that the illegal activities were within the normal course of business functions, regardless if they violated a law.</span><span class="s3">  It is worth noting that the taxpayer was no longer employed by the company, which denied wrongdoing, and was no longer engaged in the trade or business at the time the restitution payment was made.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We do not know if the separation of the criminal proceeding from the restitution proceeding was intentional on the part of taxpayer’s counsel, but the tax result was positive.</span></p>]]></content>

According to Forbes contributor and <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax law</span></a> professor Timothy Todd, these new changes require taxpayers to properly disclose reportable transaction information to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timtodd/2015/08/31/irs-proposes-changes-to-reportable-transaction-penalty-regulations/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">to the IRS</span></a>. Any penalties imposed by IRS for a violation must be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The proposed regulatory changes for a reportable transaction</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS proposed the changes to section 6707A regulations to make a clarification of the exact amount in penalties owed for failure to properly disclose reportable transaction information. Specifically, the IRS deems reportable transactions as any transaction with the potential for tax avoidance and/or tax evasion, which include listed transactions and tax shelters. However, the penalties also extend to taxpayers that fail to disclose certain reportable taxes to the SEC. These changes uphold and further elaborate on changes amended under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The proposal impacts five specific tax regulations</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These changes will alter five regulations currently in place, including clarifying the definition of a return, defining the decrease in calculating penalties, explaining the definition of listed transactions, distinguishing the minimum and maximum amounts of the penalties and outlining transactions that are applicable to the penalties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The definition of a return is clarified in the proposal as simply "return," as opposed to the current regulations which deem returns as either original, amended or applications for tentative refund.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next change would clarify the definition of the tax decrease used in calculating the penalties. What this means is that the decrease in tax that the difference in the amount of tax an individual reported on the filed return will be calculated with the amount of tax the individual should have filed on the return. It also clarified that the return with the amount that the individual should have filed will reflect adjusted gross income resulting from his or her participation in the reportable transaction. This is significant because it confirms regulations under section 6707A that deem penalties for failure to disclose reportable transaction are 75 percent of the decrease in tax filed, rather than an exact dollar amount.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further, the new IRS proposals clearly define listed transactions that need to be reported. This includes taxpayers that participated in a reportable transaction one year prior to the new proposed regulations. Therefore, with these clarified transactions, the new penalty amount will be calculated by the aggregate decrease in taxes for all non-disclosed reportable transactions on all returns. Previous IRS guidance allowed taxpayers to use a single disclosure statement to disclose multiple participation years, which meant that a taxpayer would be subject to only one penalty, regardless of how many unreported transactions existed on the return.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another major change proposed involves the ambiguity of the penalties applicable for taxpayers failing to report to the SEC. These penalties are now clarified, as are the maximum and minimum amounts of the penalties. With the proposed changes, penalties would be applied to each infraction.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pole-dancing.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pole-dancing.gif" alt="pole dancing" width="406" height="406" /></a>There are few tax cases that catch the eye of the public or have as an interesting array of participants. This one is an exception, mainly because it involves pole dancing.

The history of the matter is that the State of New York, in 2005, assessed sales tax on an adult men’s club. The club convinced an administrative law judge that the club's pole dancing was tax-exempt because of the dramatic or musical content in the performances, thus exempt. There is an exemption from sales tax for “dramatic or musical arts performances.” The State Court of Appeals disagreed and assessed $400,000 in taxes.

Fast forward to subsequent years, another audit, assessment and an appeal to an administrative law judge that was decided earlier this year. What is different are the proofs presented.
<h2>The Proofs</h2>
The club hired five experts. The experts were from the fields of anthropology, dance and theater, pole dancing/gymnastics and the culture critic from the local Albany newspaper The expert testimony supported the club’s claim that the performances were exempt because the routines were rehearsed and choreographed dance routines.   The administrative law judge heard testimony from two of the club’s performers regarding the requirements that their movements correspond to changes in the pole dancing music.

The state countered with the testimony of state tax auditor who patronized the club between ten and fifteen times so as to provide him with significant personal experience with club and its entertainment. He claimed that the dancers massaged various parts of his body and a lap dance was a full body rub. When the auditor reached that conclusion is not clear.
<h2>Split Decision</h2>
The administrative law judge rendered a split decision granting an exemption for the club’s cover charge but imposing tax on lap dances because the emphasis was on physical contact rather than choreography. The case is notable because the club was represented by an attorney who was the Libertarian candidate for attorney general of Utah who specializes in representing adult clubs. Both sides have appealed the decision.

Tax cases do not provide intriguing testimony as a general rule; however, there are a few instances that cause one to ponder the meaning of simple words.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/expatriates.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/expatriates.gif" alt="expatriates" width="402" height="402" /></a>The IRS recently issued a new set of proposed rules on taxes for high-net-worth individuals in the U.S., including citizens and residents, who receive gifts from expatriates. According to the National Law Review, the tax is significant because it is <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/irs-proposes-rules-tax-gifts-expatriates" target="_blank"><span class="s2">designed to disincentivize</span></a> U.S. citizens from expatriating individually.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The new rules</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The proposed tax, which is part of the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008, provides a final answer on whether or not a distribution from expatriates would be considered a gift. These gifts from expatriates are subject to the proposed tax retroactive to June 17, 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The way the new tax works is that the amount of the tax for a gift from an expatriate is determined by subtracting the total amount of covered gifts received during the calendar year by the amount of the expatriate's gift. The total amount of gifts that are exempt from taxes is $14,000, so this number is subtracted from the amount of gifts from an expatriate. Then this net amount is multiplied by the highest estate or gift tax rate in effect during the year the gift was received.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Less obvious things to look out for</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the new stipulations of the proposed rule is that there is a pro-rate regulation that subjects foreign trusts to taxes when they includes donations from expatriates that fall under this rule. What this means is that if an expatriate provides half the funds for a foreign trust for his or her family, half of that trust is subject to the tax - even if those include shares in a family business, for example. However, another factor to keep in mind is that taxpayers entitled to income tax deductions from foreign trust distributions need to be aware that the deductions are only applicable in the year the tax is paid. This is important because the deduction does not apply to when the distribution is made.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The expatriate is not subject to the tax, but the property included in their gross estate that is transferred to recipients is subject to tax. Further, if the expatriate's gifts are deemed charitable donations, then the gifts are exempt from the tax. A final exemption applies to marital status, which states that if expatriates send gifts to spouses that are U.S. citizens or residents, these gifts are tax exempt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A definitive distinction of the proposed rules is that if a U.S. citizen or resident receives a taxable gift from an electing domestic or foreign trust, the receiver is subject to the tax. However, if the gift is distributed through a non-electing foreign trust, that trust is not liable for the tax, but the recipient is subject to the tax.</span></p>]]></content>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Specifics of the new FBAR deadline</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The provision of the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 now requires taxpayers to file an FBAR return if the value of assets in foreign bank and financial accounts exceeds the $10,000 threshold for the previous tax year. This new rule was designed to prevent tax inversions in offshore banking and financial accounts, which includes any area outside the U.S., Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. territories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the penalties of the new rule are strict, as any violation deemed "willful" will result in a fine equal to $100,000, or 50 percent of the balance in the offshore account for each infraction. Taxpayers are subject to additional, and more severe, financial penalties for violations deemed fraudulent, or willfully falsified information. These penalties may also include a prison sentence of up to five years, but the prison term is increased to up to ten years for obstruction of justice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All investigations into delinquent FBAR taxpayers will be conducted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The new rule allows amnesty</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One important perk of the new rule is that taxpayers have an automatic six-month filing extension with a statement of explanation for late returns. Aside for the extension though, taxpayers also have access to the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program. Since the IRS recently made acceptance into the OVDP more accessible, more taxpayers are encouraged to use it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This OVDP is a special amnesty program that protects taxpayers from prosecution and absolves penalties for inaccurate information, willful or not. According to tax lawyer and Forbes contributor Robert Wood, upon acceptance into the program, the taxpayer is required to pay taxes with interest as well as a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/06/30/offshore-accounts-choose-ovdp-or-streamlined-despite-fatca/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">20 percent penalty on the amount of taxes</span></a> owed from a foreign account. The program is especially important now because the IRS has six years in the statute of limitations to track down delinquent taxpayers who failed to file their FBARs, or were late to file. However, it is important to note that the OVDP does not preclude the taxpayer from filing a tax return to report their assets in foreign accounts.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The new provision applies to businesses</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not only does the FBAR filing date change for individuals, but it is also applicable for partnerships, S Corporations and C Corporations. This is due to the Supreme Court ruling in Home Concrete v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 1836 (2012), which stated that any omission of income, net or gross, will trigger the six-year statute of limitations for the IRS to investigate the taxpayer's account history.</span></p>]]></content>

According to a Bloomberg BNA report, the decision held that the company was subject to New Jersey's related-party expense disallowance statute, and thus not exempt from filing a CBT return because it <a href="http://www.bna.com/corporate-closeup-licensing-b17179935390/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">earned revenue within state borders</span></a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Spring Licensing Group Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the case, Spring Licensing Group argued that since it is incorporated in South Carolina and licenses the trademarks it owns to companies in various states, that it was not subject to the CBT. Its argument in this case was that it should not be subject to filing an additional CBT return for the royalty payments it received from its affiliate. The primary point of contention was that the taxes had already been paid on the royalty payments by the affiliate for the intangible property licensed. Therefore, Spring Licensing Group felt that the Division of Taxation imposed double taxation through the requirement of a CBT return.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the New Jersey Division of Taxation argued that any collection of royalty income from intangible property within New Jersey borders creates a nexus, thus the company was subject to the CBT. The Division of Taxation felt that due to this nexus created, it was irrelevant whether or not Spring Licensing Group had added back the intangible expenses to the affiliate company. Further, the Division of Taxation argued that since Spring Licensing Group failed to take advantage of available tax exemptions for out-of-state intangible holding companies, it had not properly filed a CBT return.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The court ruled in favor of the Division of Taxation</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court ruled that Spring Licensing Company was required to file a CBT return because it was subject to taxation for the income it generated from licensing intangible property. In turn, the court also held that since tax relief provisions are available in the state of New Jersey, Spring Licensing Group can still apply for these exemptions. The affiliate company is also allowed to apply for a refund to avoid the double taxation of that money for the added back expenses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The issue of contention for the court was that Spring Licensing Group filed a "zero" in its CBT return for 2002, and requested a refund for estimated expenses in that year. Further, Spring Licensing Group explained that the affiliate company would report income from royalty payments on its New Jersey state tax returns. However, while the affiliate company added back the royalty payments to Spring Licensing Group, it did not seek exemption from one of the statutory regulations on add-back rules. Therefore, the court ruled that as part of the New Jersey state business tax reforms in 2002, the related-party expense disallowance statute required Spring Licensing Group to file a CBT return and add back its expenses for royalty payments it received.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The significance of the decision</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision, in this case, was a big win for the state of New Jersey Division of Taxation because even though an out-of-state intangible holding company did not create a corporate income tax nexus in New Jersey, it was subject to the corporate business tax return. This was due to the fact that since 2002, New Jersey has required all income from related-party intangible expenses to be taxable, in addition to federal income taxes. It also clarified that the add back did not excuse Spring Licensing Group from filing a CBT return.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court also cited that income shifting from out-of-state parent and in-state subsidiary companies was a concern for state departments of revenue. Therefore, the decision was made to ensure that state entities file and pay accurate taxes for disallowable expenses paid to related members.</span></p>]]></content>

Much ado has been made about the use of hybrid entities that are viewed as flow-through (transparent) or disregarded in one jurisdiction but are separate taxpayers or non-transparent in the other jurisdiction.

A United Kingdom (U.K.) resident (Anson) ran his United States (U.S.) consulting business through a Delaware limited liability company. Mr. Anson was personally responsible for and paid income taxes on his U.S. earnings. The <em>Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs</em> (“HMRC”) sought to impose tax on the remittance to the U.K. and denied Mr. Anson a credit for tax paid to the U.S.
<h2>HMRC denial</h2>
HMRC denied the credit on the grounds that the remittance was not the same as the income from business profits recognized in the U.S. The HMRC position was that business income is different than remittance which is akin to a dividend. The HMRC position is based upon its view that a limited liability company is a corporation, thus a separate person. Perhaps, this position is overstated as each limited liability company (LLC) is evaluated on facts and circumstances. The income reported in the U.S. was taxed to an individual who is taxed in the U.S. on the profits earned by a transparent entity. The view of HMRC was that the entity did not earn the income and individual members of U.S. LLCs are taxed on profits when earned and not when distributed. Fortunately for Mr. Anson, the U.K. Supreme Court held that he was entitled to the tax credit.

One can anticipate other cases if the U.K. revenue authorities continue to adhere to this position. Under the U.S. – U.K. income tax treaty, royalties paid to a U.K. resident corporation from the U.S. are exempt from withholding if a U.K. corporation does not have a permanent establishment in the U.S. Suppose the U.K. corporation interposes a U.S. limited liability company between itself and the payer. If one extends the position taken in Anson, the royalty would not qualify because the LLC is not a resident of the U.K. and it is not the payer of the royalty. Disputes might arise in other areas, such as withholding on interest, dividends, branch profits as well as the exemption for international transportation.

It is particularly important to note that a tax treaty does not always harmonized the treatment of hybrid entities.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Substantial-Compliance.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Substantial-Compliance.gif" alt="substantial compliance" width="401" height="401" /></a>Substantial Compliance</h2>
The state probate code was amended in 2004 to permit documents that were intended to have testamentary effect but were not executed in accordance with the statutory requirements. The new probate code’s doctrine of substantial compliance holds that if a document was not executed in compliance with the statute, the proponent may establish by clear and convincing evidence that the writing was intended by the decedent to be a will. The doctrine also extends to a revocation of a will, an alteration of the will or partial or complete revival of an old will.

In the Anton, the decedent was involved in divorce proceedings with his wife. He went with his son-in-law to an attorney and instructed counsel to leave one-third of his estate to two of his children and one-third in trust for the grandchildren of a third child. Subsequently, the decedent changed his mind to have his estate left outright to his children in equal shares. Drafts of a will, power of attorney and living will were prepared, mailed and approved. An appointment for execution of the will was arranged. The decedent died that morning.

The attorney testified that the drafts and the execution set of documents were identical. After taking testimony, the court granted probate to the unsigned will. One part of this story is that copies of documents were sent to a son-in-law who spoke with the decedent and attended the meetings. He was a witness who could give testimony. A second factor was that the first meeting between the attorney, decedent and son-in-law occurred twenty-one days before death. Perhaps, more importantly, execution drafts were prepared an appointment scheduled and the application for probate was unopposed.
<h2>The Decision</h2>
This decision is marked departure from the cases studied in law school where wills were not probated because the witnesses did not see the testator sign or were not in the same room to see all of the signatures affixed.

This decision leads one to imagine its impact on non-probate assets. Clearly, beneficiary designations are creatures of contract law but one wonders if a default option, such as paying retirement benefits to an estate, can be cured by having benefits payable to a qualifying trust created under an unsigned will. We know that a state statute disinheriting a divorced spouse does not trump ERISA.]]></content>

According to a Forbes report, these changes most notably include the inflation adjusted unified credit against the lifetime gift and estate tax, which will bump the threshold up from $5.43 million this year to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2015/10/22/irs-announces-2016-estate-and-gift-tax-limits-the-10-9-million-tax-break/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$5.45 million in 2016</span></a>. Oppositely, the annual gift tax exclusion threshold will stay at $14,000.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The federal estate and gift tax exemptions rise with inflation
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2016, the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption will increase to $5.45 million per individual and <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2015/oct/2016-tax-tables-inflation-adjustments-201613228.html#sthash.XLzx6Eun.dpuf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$10.9 million per married couple</span></a>, according to the Journal of Accountancy. This increase is significant to high net worth taxpayers as they are more likely to reduce the size of their estate trusts and gifts to maintain them below the tax threshold.</span></p>
It is important for taxpayers to follow rate hikes because the gift and estate tax threshold is indexed directly for inflation. For instance, since 2001, the gift and estate tax thresholds have increased from $675,000 to $1 million in 2003, and on to $2 million in 2008 before jumping up past the $5 million mark in 2011.
<h2>Annual gift exemption</h2>
The annual gift tax exclusion amount will remain at $14,000 for 2016, maintaining the same rate threshold for the third consecutive year. What this means for high net worth individuals is that they are allowed to send individual $14,000 gifts to as many people as they want. In turn, the threshold increases to $28,000 for married couples. Further, the annual exclusion for the gift tax does not apply to the lifetime gift threshold.
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Other 2016 inflation adjustments and tax tables
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS also announced several other tax changes that were adjusted for inflation. These changes included the personal exemption, which is set to increase from $4,000 this year to $4,050 in 2016. Although, the standard deduction for 2016 increases for heads of households to $9,300, up from $9,250 this year. Likewise for the adoption credit under Section 23, as this limit adjusted for inflation to $13,460 in 2016, up from $13,400 in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other major changes for 2016 include that the tax threshold for married couples filing joint returns at the highest income tax level of 39.6 percent will see that number increase from $464,850 this year to $466,950 next year. The heads of households at the highest tax bracket of 39.6 percent will also see their income tax level rise from $439,000 in 2015 to $441,000 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Earned Income Credit for taxpayers filing jointly with three or more qualifying children will move up to $6,269 this year from $6,242 in 2015. Further, the limitation for itemized deductions to be claimed in 2016 will apply to taxpayers with incomes at $259,400 and up, and $311,300 for married couples with filing joint tax returns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final increase will be the foreign earned income exclusion, which jumps from $100,800 this year to $101,300 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is also important to note that the standard deduction for married taxpayers filing joint returns will remain at $12,600 and the standard deduction for single taxpayers and married taxpayers filing separately will also hold at $6,300.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Some penalties have increased
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The procedure will now have amounts that are adjusted for inflation for various failure-to-file penalties. This is a significant development because the penalties applied to inflation adjusted amounts will be enacted for the first time as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. For instance, if a taxpayer fails to submit accurate payee statements, the inflation adjusted penalty amount under Section 6722 will not increase from $250 to $260.</span></p>]]></content>

Joseph Pennacchio, R-Morris, would provide a 1 percent tax credit for high net worth individuals earning over $500,000 annually. The goal of the bill is to stimulate the state's economy and attract small businesses and multinational corporations and prevent state-to-state migration of the top earners in New Jersey.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The bill intends to reduce state-to-state migration</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sen. Pennacchio's bill listed economic indicators that illustrate how high tax rates for businesses and high net worth residents have driven them out of the state, according to a New Jersey Spotlight report. The bill claims that stagnant growth has resulted from the 8.97 percent income tax for New Jersey's highest earners, the <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/08/05/gop-senator-sponsors-bill-to-cut-tax-rate-on-new-jersey-s-biggest-earners/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">ninth highest tax rate in the nation</span></a> and top among northeastern states. This has prevented the state's economy from remaining competitive with neighboring states such as New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Further, Pennacchio cited the fact that New Jersey has the fifth highest corporate tax rate in the U.S. at 9 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pennacchio's bill highlights how businesses and high net worth individuals are migrating to neighboring states for more favorable tax climates. According to a 2013 New Jersey census data, <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/migration/data/acs/state-to-state.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">70,000 New Jersey residents</span></a> moved to neighboring states in 2013. At its current rate, the total, domestic outflow is projected to reach 400,000 for the years 2015 to 2020. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Details of the economic growth plan</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under Pennacchio's bill, the state would reduce the current top-end income tax rate of 8.97 percent to 7.97 percent. The tax credit would significantly reduce tax revenue for the state as there would be one percent less charged on each dollar over $500,000. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is not clear how the bill will impact the income tax revenue generated by the state, as a fiscal note has not yet been prepared by legislative analysts. However, Pennacchio argued that the bill will stimulate economic growth for more than 50,000 residents who earn over $500,000 per year, thus decreasing migration and stimulating local economies. The senator also explained that the bill will position New Jersey's top-end income tax rate to become more competitive with New York at 8.82 percent, Delaware at 6.6 percent, and Pennsylvania at 3.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bill received the support of Gov. Chris Christie, R, whose administration has approved over $6 billion in corporate tax incentives since 2010. </span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>The IRS' Audit Technique Guide</h2>
<a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ATG.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ATG.gif" alt="audit technique guide" width="406" height="406" /></a>The Internal Revenue Service prepares Audit Technique Guide (ATG) to address over 50 industries or topics for their examiners. The <em>Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Audit Technique Guide</em> was designed to address common issues relevant to non-qualified plans. The ATG divides such plans into four groups: Salary Reduction Arrangements, Bonus Deferral Arrangements, Top-Hat Plans (aka Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans) and Excess Benefit Plans. There is an emphasis in the ATG on making certain that the deduction and the income recognition occur in the same year. What is more important is that the rules for recognizing income and FICA/FUTA are not the same.
<h2>What the Audit Technique Guide covers</h2>
The examiner is advised to look in several areas, including employment contracts, minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors, minutes of meetings compensation committee, employment contracts, insurance and annuity polices. These areas frequently yield items resulting in audit adjustments. Many of these arrangements have non-conforming elements, such as the ability to borrow against the fund or pledge it as collateral. Many times the fund is not available to creditors, thereby causing the individual taxpayer to be in to constructive receipt of what should be deferred compensation.

Income tax return Schedule M receives special attention. Schedule M items should be examined by the agent who is instructed to reconcile deferrals and payments. W-2s may reveal certain inconsistencies. Examiners are advised that excess Medicare wages represent deferrals of income while shortages represent current year distributions of deferred compensation.  Often times the restrictions lapse without income recognition.
<h2>Why the Audit Technique Guide is needed</h2>
Consider a recent CCA which stated “[i]f at any time during a taxable year a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (I) fails to meet the requirements of section 409A(2), (3), and (4), or (II) is not operated in accordance with such requirements, all compensation deferred under the plan for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years shall be includible in the service provider's gross income for the taxable year to the extent not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income.” An executive was entitled to a retention bonus and the written plan allowed the company to accelerate the bonus. Such acceleration violated the time and form of payment rules. In year 3, months prior to vesting of the year 3 payment, the employer corrected the plan. The IRS held that the plan failed to meet the requirements of 409A at all times during year 3 and the correction prior to the vesting date did not cure the problem. The executive was treated as constructively receiving income in Year 3, with the IRS audit adjustment coming some two years later.

Finally, there are many limited liability companies that have deferred compensation plans that are not recognized as such. A service partner, such as a construction manager in a real estate development project who is vested in his partnership interest is not the same as an executive or IT manager with a partnership interest subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/new-jersey-debt.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/new-jersey-debt.gif" alt="new jersey debt" width="399" height="399" /></a>The state of New Jersey now has the <a href="http://nj1015.com/report-nj-has-highest-tax-burden-in-america/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">highest debt burden per taxpayer</span></a> in the U.S., according to Truth in Accounting research cited by a NJ 101.5 report. The data collected in the report showed that New Jersey also has the highest property taxes in the nation on average. All told, the report stated that New Jersey has $28.6 billion in assets, with more than $185 billion in liabilities. In turn, according to a <a href="http://mycentraljersey.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">MyCentralJersey.com</span></a> report, the state expects to have its local property taxes <a href="http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2015/10/10/new-jersey-property-tax/73683040/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">increase to $540 million</span></a> by the end of the year, which will break down to approximately $52,300 per taxpayer.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey's rising tax burden</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Critics have argued that following several administrations that relied heavily on loans, the rising debt totals have contributed to the tax burden. The Truth in Accounting report examined the tax debts of each state and calculated the amounts of money the state would need to pay off those debts, divided by the number of residents in those states. With these calculations, the researchers found that New Jersey saw its tax burden jump to $52,300, $4,000 higher per taxypayer than Connecticut, the second-worst tax-burdened state. According to an NJ 101.5 interview with Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick, R-Westfield, these tax burdens continue to rise despite stiffer taxes on high net worth individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New Jersey debt burden per individual increased from $36,000 in 2014. Bramnick stated that part of the reason for this increase was due to the staggering liability as a result of the state's unfunded public employee pensions. Bramnick commented that of the $186 billion the state owes, $140 billion is for retirement benefits plans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without sufficient assets to cover the mounting debt, New Jersey is facing stiffer tax burdens in the near future, particularly for the high net worth community.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What this could mean for high net worth taxpayers in the future</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the state's new business development has slowed in recent years, the New Jersey state legislature has discussed increasing income and estate tax rates on millionaires; however, the amounts at which the highest rates kick in are well below one million dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has been suggested that New Jersey may follow the path taken in California with its famous Proposition 13 that limited property tax increases. What is clear that property taxes are a substantial portion of municipal revenue and there is no substitute source of revenue at the present time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey, with 565 municipalities, is famous for home rule which means those municipalities will not relinquish their taxing authority. Second, the state relies upon existing sources of revenue and cannot abandon them in this time of fiscal deficits and extraordinary liability. New Jersey death taxes reportedly raise $800 million of revenue each year, so the $675,000 estate tax threshold and the inheritance tax on collateral heirs are fixtures. Sales tax, perhaps the most regressive of taxes, will remain another substantial source of state revenue as long as the extraordinary pension liability remains unpaid.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Introducing the Cadillac tax</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cadillac-tax.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cadillac-tax.gif" alt="cadillac tax" width="410" height="410" /></a>On July 31, the IRS and the Treasury issued Notice 2015-52 that explained all the potential issues and approaches of the proposed Cadillac tax regulations, according to the National Law Review. The Cadillac tax requires compliance from employers and thus, Notice 2015-52 calls for business owners to begin planning for the health care <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/aca-cadillac-tax-cruising-toward-proposed-regulations" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax implications</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The statute is referred to as the Cadillac tax because it is designed to impact employer-sponsored rich or premium health plans for executives and senior managers in addition to super-rich health benefits for employees.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The new Cadillac tax</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cadillac tax, Sec. 4980I, will impose a 40 percent nondeductible excise tax on the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored health coverage that exceeds a statutory dollar limit. Effective 2018, the Cadillac tax will raise the dollar limits for self-only coverage to $10,200 and $27,500 for family coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The taxes can be assumed by employer</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The employer is the coverage provider for health savings accounts and Archer medical savings accounts. Following the end of each calendar year, excise taxes will be imposed on the employer if the cost of applicable coverage for an employee exceeds the dollar limit in any month. It is then the responsibility of the employer to calculate the excise tax that applies to each employee, and contact the coverage provider as well as the IRS. Further, the employer will calculate the amount of tax reimbursement they will owe to the coverage provider.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the tax</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One the main issues related to the monthly calculations of the tax is that myriad arrangements can significantly raise the benefits limits as these costs may not be known till the end of the coverage year. According to a 2014 Towers Watson &amp; Co. study, the tax will hit half of all employers in 2018 and more than <a href="http://www.towerswatson.com/~/media/Pdf/Insights/Newsletters/Americas/Insider/Towers-Watson-Insider-April-2015.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">82 percent</span></a> by 2023. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, another main issue for insurers and employers is that the Cadillac tax may result in double taxation. Under the statute, insurers are required to pay the excise tax, but employers then reimburse insurers for the tax amount. This income is then treated as income for the insurer, which means it is subject to taxation for a second time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Notice 2015-52, the IRS has not decided how the tax will be collected.</span></p>]]></content>

Section 1031 or like-kind exchanges have become commonplace and most accountants have one or more individual income tax returns where an exchange is reported. There are however an increasing number of taxpayers who believe they can prepare their personal or business entity returns. While this is not the norm, it prove fatal to the success of an exchange if one is not careful. Consider the following regulation.
<h2> Treasury regulation for Section 1031 exchanges</h2>
Treasury Reg. § 1.1031(k)-1(b) (ii) - provides as follows:

(ii) The exchange period begins on the date the taxpayer transfers the relinquished property and ends at midnight on the earlier of the 180th day thereafter or the due date (including extensions) for the taxpayer’s return of the tax for the taxable year, in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs.
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
This means that you have 180 days after closing your relinquished property to complete your exchange unless your tax filing deadline (April 15th for most taxpayers) occurs first. In that case,  exchange period will expire on April 15<sup>th</sup> UNLESS you extend the deadline for filing your income tax return. That is, you reduce your 180 day period unless you file an extension. An exchange beginning with a sale of relinquished property on December 1<sup>st</sup> must be completed by April 15<sup>th</sup> of the following year, a period of only 146 days unless the taxpayer extends his or her return.

Most readers will argue that most returns are extended because so much information is unavailable by April 15<sup>th</sup> and the problem will not arise. Perhaps, but we see more individuals seizing control of their filings relying on software as a substitute for professionals.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/filing-tax-returns-on-time.gif"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/filing-tax-returns-on-time.gif" alt="filing tax returns on time" width="396" height="396" /></a>Filing tax returns on time</h2>
I was asked if there is any drawback to not filing tax returns on time or to paying taxes late or not at all. Aside from the obvious, there are other ramifications that may not manifest for some time.

We encounter in our practice business owners who have fallen behind in paying income taxes. One of the options that must be considered is bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this alternative may not be available with respect to certain tax debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. In the most general of terms, bankruptcy claims are either secured or unsecured, with the unsecured claims further divided into priority claims and general unsecured claims. Taxes are deemed to be pre-petition claims if the taxable year for the taxes ends before the taxpayer files the bankruptcy petition.
<h2>Business owner income tax returns &amp; the law</h2>
This statement would appear to cover the business owner’s income tax returns until we ask if the income tax returns were filed timely.

<em>Non-dischargeable claims in bankruptcies involving individuals, include tax debts with respect to which (1) a required return was not filed <strong>or was filed late</strong> <strong>and within two years before the bankruptcy petition was filed,</strong> or (2) the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted to evade tax.</em>

The logic of the law is sound. An individual should not receive a discharge in bankruptcy for tax obligations if he or she does not file a return or files a fraudulent return. The late return is the more interesting provision. If taxpayers were allowed to file late and then discharge those taxes in bankruptcy, the IRS would never have the opportunity to initiate collection action. Moreover, if taxpayers could withhold returns for several years before filing those returns and filing bankruptcy, there would be significant revenue loss to the public and little incentive for anyone to file on time.
<h2>Why else is filing tax returns on time important?</h2>
There is another reason why filing timely is important. We represent executors of estates where a decedent, either divorced or never married, has passed away and left his property to children or siblings. In these instances, there is no one who can access information from online sources for the decedent’s self-prepared return or who has any inkling on how the non-filing parent kept records for income tax purposes. Although we are able to request copies of income tax returns and transcripts from the IRS, recent budget cuts (practitioner hotline) and data breaches has slowed the process significantly or stalled it altogether.

Another issue is whether the statute of limitations has run on income tax returns from prior years. In one matter, we do not know if or when returns were filed and this makes it difficult to assess if there is any risk from these filings. In the other matter, we are certain returns have not been filed. This would not a significant problem were it not for rental property (Schedule E) income and expense that is difficult to identify. In each instance, a timely filed return for the tax year before death would have provided a roadmap.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a recent decision, the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed a Tax Court decision that since a company had assembling operations in the state, this qualified as taxable use. According to a Bloomberg BNA report, the Superior Court of New Jersey upheld the tax court's decision that J&amp;J Snack Foods, the largest manufacturer of soft pretzels in the country as well as the famous maker of Slush Puppies, was <a href="http://www.bna.com/sales-tax-slice-b57982059062/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">subject to a use tax</span></a> assessment that totaled $250,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision held that J&amp;J Snack Foods received machine parts in New Jersey and assembled the parts into pretzel-warming machines for use by customers located in and out-of-state. This was classified as a taxable use of the parts in New Jersey, a provision broadly written to define use as the exercise of the right or power over tangible personal property by the purchaser.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the J&amp;J Snack Foods case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The case originally involved a use tax audit by the state of New Jersey on J&amp;J Snack Foods in 1992, which resulted in the company being told that it was required to pay the tax assessment - regardless of whether or not it sold or loaned any machines to customers within New Jersey borders. However, the company argued that it paid the necessary amount of taxes, and that sales and use taxes were not applicable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although in <i>J&amp;J Snack Foods Sales Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, N.J.</i>, the Tax Court agreed with the state by asserting that the company was required to pay the use tax on all the machine parts used to assemble warmers, even if the machines themselves were used out of state.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In opposition, the company challenged the application of the tax code by asserting that the Tax Court was mistaken in that the purchase of machine parts for the warmers were retail sales. J&amp;J Snack Foods then alleged that these warmer parts were bought for re-sale, and not as a part of the product to be sold by the company. The company's argument then was that it was not subject to use taxes because the warmers were not loaned or sold for profit. The company also argued that the State acquiesced in its treatment in the audit from the 1990s and was stopped from raising the issue many years later.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Appellate Division upholds the Tax Court's decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court initially ruled that the company's purchase of the parts and subsequent re-sale, along with the assembling and distribution of the warmers, qualified within the sales and use tax act's ambit. Therefore, according to a report by the Altus Group, the company <a href="http://us.altusgroup.com/newsroom/blog/2015/salt-roundup-09212015/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">owed the use tax</span></a>, regardless of whether customers used the machine within the state or outside of its borders. In turn, in upholding the Tax Court's decision, the Superior Court of New Jersey found that J&amp;J Snack Foods owed $258,226.99 in use taxes.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What the decisions means for taxpayers</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sales and use tax imposition can be difficult as it varies state by state. Therefore, as states do not often clarify their positions on the use <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax laws</span></a>, and often oppose each other, it is difficult for taxpayers to understand their tax burdens. For instance, had J&amp;J Snack Foods been incorporated in Wyoming, the company would have not been subject to the sales and use tax because the items produced were prepared for use in a different state.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the decision from a broader perspective</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the issues presented by the Superior Court's upholding of the Tax Court's decision is that it gives J&amp;J Snack Foods, which has been headquartered in New Jersey for its entire existence, incentive to relocate its operations outside of the state, or outsource the assembling of the warmer machines rather than have them built in New Jersey. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further, this decision is significant because from a broader perspective, taxpayers should be aware that any operations, regardless of whether these are essential operations of the company, may be subject to the use tax depending on the state law and regulation. Taxpayers can be certain that the absence of symmetry between state statutes can produce unexpected results between states. Taxpayers can also be certain that, as long as state budget deficits persist, they will face aggressive readings of law and regulation by tax collectors.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New Jersey Supreme Court recently decided not to hear the appeal case filed by the federal pension beneficiary of a domestic partnership couple. According to a Law 360 report, Claudette A. Lugano was denied state inheritance tax exemption as a domestic partner because the Court ruled that she did <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/714190/nj-high-court-snubs-domestic-partner-inheritance-tax-case" target="_blank"><span class="s2">not meet the requirements</span></a> of the exemption in accordance with New Jersey state law.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Lugano's argument for the state's inheritance tax exemption</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <i>Lugano v. Director, Division of Taxation</i>, Lugano argued to the court that she was entitled to receive exemption from the state's inheritance tax because she was a recognized domestic partner. According to a report a New Jersey firm specializing in elder law, Lugano's point was that she had lived with her <a href="http://blog.finkrosnerershow-levenberg.com/tag/lugano-v-director-division-of-taxation/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">domestic partner for eight years</span></a>. Her partner was also a federal employee, and thus the couple was required to file a form with the federal government to designate their relationship. After Lugano and her partner filed that form with the federal government, they were under the assumption that they had fulfilled the New Jersey requirements to designate their relationship as domestic partners.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The NJ court decides not to hear the appeal</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the initial case, the New Jersey Tax Court ruled that Lugano and her partner had not, in fact, filed the necessary forms required under the state Domestic Partnership Act. Therefore, the court held that Lugano would be required to pay the state's inheritance tax as a Class D beneficiary of her domestic partner's federal pension benefits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey then used this decision as the basis for declining to hear the appeal case. In its decision to throw out the appeal, the court asserted that the Tax Court was accurate in its decision that Lugano does not qualify for the inheritance tax exemption due to the fact that the couple did not fill out all the necessary forms, including an affidavit for domestic partnership within New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lugano had assumed that a domestic partnership declaration submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank should be sufficient to receive the tax exemption. However, the Superior Court ruled that this was only sufficient to be classified as a common law or de facto marriage, which was rejected by the state legislature for inheritance tax exemption. In turn, the Court also ruled that the New Jersey law is not applicable for federal pensions.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The ramifications</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result of the decision not to hear the appeal, Lugano will be forced to pay more than $100,000 to the state of New Jersey as a Class D beneficiary, which comes with a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2014/07/21/new-jersey-domestic-partners-lose-estate-benefit-by-not-registering/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">15 percent tax on inheritance</span></a>, according to Forbes contributor Peter J Reilly, a certified public accountant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From a broader perspective with domestic partnership couples, it is important to note that individuals who filed as couples for tax purposes with their companies prior to the domestic partner law will need to file an affidavit for their relationships. Otherwise, the partnership will not be recognized.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS recently warned that the agency has collected $8 billion in taxes and fines collected from offshore bank account penalties which were a result of not conforming to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. According to a report by Forbes contributor and tax lawyer Robert Wood, the IRS has begun to warn taxpayers, both U.S. citizens and residents, with offshore accounts that if they have not properly disclosed their financial information, they will be subject to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/10/19/irs-offshore-account-penalties-go-up-more-banks-sign-u-s-disclosure-deal/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">taxes and penalties</span></a> unless they join the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program or the streamlined procedures.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Taxpayers have two options</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Individuals with offshore bank accounts can join the OVDP or apply for its streamlined program to mitigate past errors or omissions on their tax returns disclosures. These programs will afford taxpayers the opportunity to avoid potential penalties for not complying with the FATCA. This is crucial for taxpayers because under the FATCA, there is now an intergovernmental network between the U.S. and various partner jurisdictions to share foreign account information. As a result, the IRS warned that more thorough investigations into offshore accounts will be conducted this year.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">For taxpayers who may be in violation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most taxpayers, the offshore account penalties under the OVDP is 27.5 percent, as compared to the normal fine that is 50 percent of the foreign account balance. It is important to note though, that the IRS now pursues all taxpayers with accounts at financial institutions overseas, so the offshore account penalties will be universally applicable. Further, for those who are not compliant with reporting worldwide income on U.S. tax returns, taxpayers should apply for eligibility in the OVDP. The IRS has warned taxpayers that along with the potential criminal liabilities for failing to disclose foreign accounts, the civil penalties could be staggering for individuals who have not properly disclosed their financial information.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the new initiative</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As always, willful civil violations for failing to disclose foreign accounts will be subject to penalties, but now the IRS has implemented a more diligent approach with third party investigators. These offshore account penalties include the same level at $100,000, or 50 percent, of the account balance for each taxpayer violation.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1">The recent Technical Bulletin issued by the New Jersey Division of Taxation established a final set of guidelines for activities that subject a company to the corporate business nexus tax. These guidelines include a detailed description of activities that are outside the protection of Public Law 86-272 for in-state companies, according to a Wolters Kluwer report on the Technical Bulletin.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The corporate business nexus guidelines</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All domestic or nonresident corporations are required to pay an annual franchise tax for various privileges that stem from a nexus in the state, as listed in the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act. The way this works is that if a foreign company has a nexus in New Jersey, meaning that it has a significant physical presence in the state, it is subject to the corporation business tax. This law now encompasses privileges for companies with a nexus in New Jersey, including exercising a corporate franchise, deriving receipts from revenue sources, communicating or engaging with contacts and conducting business - which includes having employees, owning capital or property and maintaining an office in the state.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same rules apply to foreign business with a corporate franchise in New Jersey, except for two addendums. If the foreign company is registered with the New Jersey Department of Revenue, and if the business has authorization issued by a New Jersey government department or agency to engage in corporate activities in the state.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Determinants of a corporate business nexus within the state</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several qualifications that determine whether a business qualifies as having a nexus in New Jersey. These classifications pertain to the nature and extent of business activities, the office and business locations and the continuity and frequency of activities in the state. The corporate business <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax law</span></a> also evaluates the employment of agents, officers and employees within New Jersey state limits, as well as the location of the actual seat of executive management and/or the individuals in control of the corporation.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Net income tax exemptions for foreign corporations under Public Law 86-272</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The state of New Jersey adheres to Public Law 86-272, also known as the Federal Interstate Income Act. This federal law prohibits any state from the imposition of a tax based on the net income a foreign business earned from interstate commerce. Further, the law explains that a foreign company is exempt from a net income-based tax if its only business activities in a state are to solicit orders of tangible personal property, and then have these orders sent outside the state's borders to be filled for shipment or delivery.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Exceeding the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there are certain business activities that exceed the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act. For instance, the NJ Division of Taxation clarified in the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act that if a foreign company conducts business activities in the state that qualify it as having a nexus within the state, it is subject to the corporation business tax that is determined by the net income of the company - not simply the net income earned within the state of New Jersey. This is significant because that foreign company is subject to the corporate business tax due to a nexus in the state, <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tb/tb79r.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">even if its activities are protected</span></a> by the Federal Interstate Income Act.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Specific business activities not protected under Public Law 86-272</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The activities of foreign companies that create a nexus in New Jersey include repairs, installations, maintenance, property collections or repossessions, credit investigations and providing technical support. These business activities also involve conducting training events of any kind for employees and company personnel, consigning tangible personal property, picking up damaged or returned property and maintaining facilities in the state. Further activities outside of the protection of the Federal Interstate Income Act encompass accepting orders or securing deposits on sales, personnel acquisitions for purposes other than solicitation, maintaining displays at in-state locations for longer than two weeks, distributing or exchanging samples for sales solicitation and resolving customer complaints for purposes other than to position sales employees to curry favor with the customer.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Open Issues</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It remains to be seen how the conflict between the varying  state rules will be resolved. The New York rule is that if the service is delivered to a New York customer location, it is deemed to be taxable in New York.  New Jersey reportedly will treat the same transaction as a New Jersey sale if the work was performed in New Jersey.  A consultant can perform the work in New Jersey and deliver it on-line to a New York client. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some point, a uniform standard imposed on all states would be welcome.  Perhaps, when we enact a VAT we will obtain this as well.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">New estate planning channel for older demographic?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/estate-planning.gif" alt="estate planning" width="407" height="407" />A recent decision by the U.S. Tax Court affirmed the estate planning opportunity for older individuals that was perceived by some as being safely available in the Fifth Circuit where the Tax Court's McCord decision, that was adverse to the taxpayer, was reversed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a Law 360 report, the Tax Court ruled that the taxable value of a multimillion-dollar gift was decreased by a commitment from her daughters to <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/713327/tax-court-hands-older-donors-new-estate-planning-tool" target="_blank"><span class="s2">pay additional estate taxes</span></a> in the event their mother died within a three-year period.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court rejected its previous decision in McCord v. Commissioner, the Tax Court stated that the IRS was not owed the gift tax amount they demanded from Jean Steinberg's <a href="http://www.bna.com/tax-court-no-b17179878828/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$123 million estate</span></a>, according to Bloomberg BNA. This was due to the fact that Steinberg's daughters entered into an agreement to pay an additional tax to be assessed on their mother's estate if she died within a three-year period of making the gift to her daughters. However, despite their agreement, the Tax Court ruled that the estate tax decreased the gift value by $5.8 million due to the probability of mother's death based on federal mortality tables.  Presumably, taxpayers residing outside the Fifth Circuit may take comfort from this decision.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The gift tax exclusion</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In accordance with Section 2035 of IRS tax code, if gifts are given that qualify for gift taxes, and the donor happens to die within a three-year period, then the taxes paid on the gift are added back to the value of the estate for tax purposes. According to a Law 360 interview with David A. Handler, a partner with Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, Section 2035 was designed to discourage donors from <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/713327/tax-court-hands-older-donors-new-estate-planning-tool" target="_blank"><span class="s2">giving deathbed gifts</span></a> as a way to manipulate state and federal <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax laws</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"This is good, we have a court confirming that we can reduce the value of the gift if we want to do this, but it's not necessarily something we do every time," Handler stated. "It's not just free money. The client might be on the hook for a real check. That's why it's not a home run."</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court case concerned the estate of Meyer Steinberg, who left a marital trust with $123 million in assets, with his wife Jean as trustee. The marital trust would then transfer the estate to their four daughters. The daughters then requested that the marital trust be terminated so they could receive the assets, but they just needed to pay the resulting gift and estate taxes if their mother died within three years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the agreement, Steinberg reported $72 million in taxable gifts and $32 million in gift tax liabilities on her 2008 tax return. An appraiser then asserted that the value of the assets should be cut by $5.8 million because the daughters agreed to pay the estate taxes if they arise. However, the IRS took exception to this and issued Steinberg a notice of deficiency that determined the asset value to be $4 million higher than the appraisal and that a $1.8 million additional gift tax should be applied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court agreed with Steinberg in that the taxable value of the assets must be decreased. This was due to the fact that the agreement between Steinberg and her daughters was a contract of willing buyers and sellers. Therefore, the estate taxes would be detrimental to the buyer, and would certainly have caused them to request that the estate valuation be reduced.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court's decision opened up a new opportunity for gift valuation discounts as they relate to estate planning. However, this new opportunity is best applicable for older individuals because the tax reduction is directly related to the probability of the death of the donor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is also important to note that the decision could make any gift tax savings a moot point due to the potentially staggering estate tax obligations if the donor dies within the three-year period of the gift. Therefore, according to a separate Law 360 interview with Steve R. Akers, senior fiduciary counsel at Bessemer Trust, the new channel for estate tax planning is mainly geared toward older individuals in their 80s as the <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/713327/tax-court-hands-older-donors-new-estate-planning-tool" target="_blank"><span class="s2">odds of death are higher</span></a> within three years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"If someone in their 60s does this, the likelihood of dying within three years is pretty low," Akers explained. "It's a gamble, and it's really almost a meaningless effort to do this unless someone is in their 80s."</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Are Roth IRAs more profitable for the taxpayer?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ROTH-Iras-more-profitable.gif" alt="Roth IRAs more profitable" width="401" height="401" />Many taxpayers are wondering about the impact of the new IRS ruling on Roth IRA total annual contribution limits. According to a National Law Review report, on Oct. 21, the IRS ruling will create fewer limitations on after-tax contributions directly to Roth IRAs when a taxpayer retires, but the annual contribution limit <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/irs-issues-2016-cost-living-plan-limits"><span class="s2">will not increase</span></a> in 2016.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The new rules make it easier to increase after-tax contributions</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These recent changes on Roth IRAs are designed to increase their savings with after-tax contributions. The new IRS rules were established to make after-tax contribution conversions to Roth IRAs easier when taxpayers leave companies. This enables individuals to roll over their pre-tax contributions and earnings into a traditional IRA and convert after-tax contributions into separate Roth IRAs. In turn, the new rules allow the funds to grow free of tax and remain free of tax even on withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although ROTH contributions are made on an after-tax basis, neither the contributions nor the earnings are taxable income when distributed. The law enacted in 2010, as amended in 2012, permit an in-plan rollover on non-Roth account balances.  Note that income tax may be due on the converted amount to the extend it is attributable to pre-tax elective deferrals and matching contributions or earnings on non-Roth after-tax contributions. The in-plan rollover will not be subject to an early distribution penalty if the funds remain in the plan for five years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning for the retirement of executives, one must consider that $53,000 Defined Benefit Contribution limit may be used to create future tax free income via ROTH.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The limitations that remain unchanged</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 2016 dollar limitations for retirement plan contributions and various retirement items related to the annual cost-of-living adjustments will remain the same. According to an Accounting Web report, for most taxpayers, the pre-tax elective deferral contribution limit for 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government Thrift Saving Plan will remain up to <a href="http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-401k-contribution-limit-to-stay-the-same-in-2016" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$18,000 in 2016</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are other key limitations that will remain unchanged in 2016. For instance, the annual catch-up contribution limit for taxpayers who are over 50 years of age will stay at $6,000. Further, the annual contribution limitations to an IRA will remain unchanged at $5,500.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another factor that remained unchanged was that the tax deduction for traditional IRA contributions is eliminated for taxpayers who have modified adjusted gross incomes within a specific range.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A final aspect that will remain unchanged is that the adjusted gross income elimination range for a married taxpayer filing a separate return will remain up to $10,000 and any contributions to Roth IRAs will continue to not be subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall significance for taxpayers</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">High net worth taxpayers who have exceeded the limitations of their various other saving options will stand to benefit from the new IRS rule changes. The significance of this new ruling for the ultra wealthy community is that they have the opportunity to increase their retirement savings as they near the end of their careers through "super-funding" options with a bucket of tax-free income.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Could this be the end for current family limited partnership discounts?</h2>
<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/family-limited-partnership-discounts.gif" alt="family limited partnership discounts" width="399" height="399" />Recent news out of Washington, D.C. suggests that the Administration, the Treasury and IRS intend to eliminate or substantially reduce the availability of discounts in the valuation of interests in Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs) and other closely held businesses.

Currently, the family limited partnership discounts result from a lack of marketability and lack of control of the interest being valued. FLPs, for this purposes of this discussion, include limited liability companies. The State of New Jersey as its own regulation restricting discounts in a family setting. My experience with closely held and family businesses suggests that there is no market for a minority interest in such an enterprise because of the human element.

The increase in the federal exemption, currently $5,430.000, has taken some pressure off estate tax planning; however, many advisors are becoming more concerned about the income tax burden associated with rising individual tax rates and capital gains rates. The thought is that the higher marginal income and capital gain tax rates will do more long-term harm to the financial health of a family.
<h2>Ideas to consider</h2>
If we cannot discount our way transferring assets free of estate and gift tax with the same flexibility as in the past, should we focus on stepping up basis? This is question that is trending at the moment although one should not give up entirely on what has been established.

One strategy that should be considered is the use of existing FLPs in accomplishing an indirect transfer of wealth. A reader may be familiar with defective grantor trusts where the income is taxed to the grantor although he or she does not receive the income. The concept is the same in that FLPs are used where the right circumstances exist.

A parent has a low basis property that has been depreciated substantially although it is more in the way of market value. Children have either cash or other assets. An FLP is established whereby allocations of book depreciation exceed tax depreciation because the parent has already taken tax depreciation. In order to balance the economics of the deal, the children must receive tax allocations to prevent the parent from shifting, of taxable income that parent would have recognized, to the children.

Advisors should consider the use of curative or remedial allocations to increase the income tax liability of the parent. This would result in an indirect benefit to the children by reducing their tax liability. These rules are not likely to disappear any time soon. I suggest that clients may not be maximizing the benefit of existing FLPs through this indirect means.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In what has been deemed by the tabloids as a family soap opera, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in a recent landmark case of the Redstone family that the transfer of stocks does not qualify as a taxable gift because the transfer was made for full and adequate consideration in money or money's worth. According to a Law 360 report, this was a significant decision because the ruling drew a distinction between a transfer that is done "in the ordinary course of a business" and <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/719047/tax-court-says-redstone-stock-transfer-not-a-taxable-gift" target="_blank"><span class="s2">gifts made for tax purposes</span></a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The case of Edward Redstone's estate</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The case involved Edward Redstone, the younger brother Sumner Redstone, the media magnate and majority owner of National Amusements Inc. In the initial ruling, the IRS wrote that the transfer of $1.3 million in National Amusement stock to Edward Redstone's children classified as a taxable gift. The IRS found that because this $5 million in shares was part of a settlement in 1972 to resolve ownership shares in the company, the stocks qualified as a business transaction for federal tax purposes. The court found that the transfer was bona fide, arm's length and free of donative intent which are the three elements in the regulations that must be satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its assessment of the case, the IRS argued that the stock transfer was not an ordinary business use. It also stated that since the Redstone children were not listed as heirs to the ownership shares, this transfer should be considered a taxable gift. The vexing and public nature of the litigation was strong evidence of the absence of donative intent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS then assessed Edward Redstone's transfer to have more than $1.2 million in penalties and tax deficiencies as well as interest for the 44 year period after the settlement. Therefore, it argued that Edward Redstone owed $737,625 in federal gift taxes, $368,813 for tax fraud, $184,406 for failure to pay the gift taxes in a timely manner and $36,881 for negligence involved in the 1972 settlement transfer.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court's decision rules in favor of the Redstone family</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court disagreed with the IRS because the transfer did not have donative intent. In fact, the transfer was ruled to be done in the course of ordinary business because it was classified as a legitimate arm's-length transaction. Therefore, citing previous rulings on estate and gift tax precedents, the Tax Court found that the stocks were not subject to federal gift taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was due to the fact that Edward Redstone had been part owner of National Amusements, but was forced out after several problems among family members. The conflicts eventually led to a settlement where Edward Redstone was given ownership shares in the company that were redeemed later for $5 million. In the settlement, Edward Redstone also agreed to transfer $1.3 million of these stocks to his children in a trust. The Tax Court ruled that this transfer was done in exchange for recognition that Edward Redstone was the outright owner of the larger portion of the ownership stakes worth $3.7 million.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, the Tax Court found that the gift tax was not applicable for transfers that are deemed ordinary business transactions. The transaction was for a "full and adequate consideration in money or money's worth," and thus not subject to federal gift taxes as part of the 1972 settlement.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The U.S. Tax Court recently ruled that an investor cannot cite mental health, specifically autism spectrum disorder, as an excuse for failure to file accurate federal income taxes because the taxpayer failed to present evidence that would constitute reasonable cause. Health reasons can provide reasonable cause if the taxpayer cannot function because of the severity and duration of the illness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Law360 report, the Court also asserted that there are no exceptions for late return filings for taxpayers that use a <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/716011/tax-court-says-trader-cannot-cite-asperger-s-in-irs-row" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Section 475(f) mark-to-market accounting method</span></a> for reporting securities trades. Section 475(f) mark-to-market permits a taxpayer to mark his portfolio to market, as if the positions were actually sold at year-end. In exchange for forgoing capital gain, a taxpayer has ordinary income or loss. Anyone with large capital losses and no capital gain to offset will inquire on whether the capital losses can be converted into ordinary losses in order to offset other income.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once a method of accounting is properly, the taxpayer must adhere to the particular requirements for reporting. The taxpayer failed to demonstrate that he properly elected Section 475 and he did not report in a manner consistent with that method. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2013, William F. Poppe filed his 2007 tax returns following a notice of tax deficiency sent to him by the IRS. Poppe had reported a $1.2 million loss for 2003, for which he corrected the amount of capital gains and losses he claimed on his 2007 return. In his claim, he stated that his election of using a mark-to-market method in 2003 allowed him to make the correction on his 2007 return, and therefore not be subject to further taxes owed in addition to interest and penalties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For his mistake, Poppe argued that his Asperger's syndrome caused him to fall into a deep depression over his investment losses, which in turn resulted in a lack of organization in filing his tax return.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court rules in favor of the IRS due to filing mistakes</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court rejected Poppe's claims that his Asperger's syndrome and election to use a mark-to-market accounting strategy excused him from tax deficiencies. With regards to the mark-to-market method, the Court ruled that by not accurately reporting his investment losses on his 2007 returns, the losses should be treated as net operating losses. In turn, the Court argued that this mark-to-market method was filed in 2003, which meant that it should be applicable to that year, and not 2007. Further, the judge also claimed that he did not keep an accurate record of his mark-to-market method used in 2003, so he could not make the claim for his corrected return for 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court also cited three other mistakes that he made in using the mark-to-market method. The first was that he did not obtain a signed copy of the mark-to-market method, so there was no evidence of it being filed on time in 2003. Secondly, taxpayers need to file returns with mark-to-market methods by April 15 of the tax year. He filed his return on July 25, 2005 for his 2003 tax year. Finally, he failed to attach the signed copy of the Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, to his 2003 tax return. In turn, the Court ruled that these mistakes rendered his tax claim invalid.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Asperger's syndrome not a valid excuse for inaccurate tax return filings</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court asserted that his Asperger's syndrome did not prevent him from filing tax returns or other functions that require "a high degree of concentration and ability to analyze and organize information." According to Accounting Today, this ruling refuted the witness testimony from a licensed psychologist who claimed that the chronic and pervasive nature of the neurological disorder left him <a href="http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/tax-practice/when-hassle-calls-are-useful-76172-1.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">incapable of conducting certain executive activities</span></a> due to his inadequate social cognition and extreme dependence on routines. Therefore, he was not cognizant of the gravity of failing to file his tax returns accurately and in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court disagreed with this assessment because the witness was neither a licensed medical physician and did not treat him during the listed years in the case. Further, the Court's decision claimed that based on the fact that he did not seek treatment for his disability during the listed years, and that he was gainfully employed as an active securities trader, he was not incapable of managing his business affairs. Thus there was no reasonable cause for failure to file proper returns. The taxpayer's proofs for the relevant time period were weak or non-existent and the decision is no surprise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are cases where the severity and duration of the illness are severe and so sudden in its onset that the taxpayer could not have planned for it. One such example is a taxpayer who became a quadriplegic as the result of an automobile accident. Taxpayers should not count on the mercy of the courts, except in extreme personal circumstances.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals refused to hear a case that involved Mary C. Fontaine, a retired equity partner from Mayer Brown LLP, who accused Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of wrongfully denying her disability benefits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a Bloomberg BNA report, the court ruled that <a href="http://www.bna.com/seventh-circuit-rules-n57982063492/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Employee Retirement Income Security Act did not preempt state law</span></a> which restricted discretionary clauses, and therefore Fontaine was owed disability benefits under the plan. This decision was significant because the court asserted that insurance companies do not have the right to revise health and disability insurance policies based on discretionary clauses listed in ERISA plans.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the case, Fontaine stated that she was forced to retire due to problems with her vision. Law 360 reported that she claimed that her vision problems <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/699926/metlife-can-t-escape-ex-mayer-brown-atty-s-disability-claims" target="_blank"><span class="s2">qualified under the disability plan</span></a> listed in the insurance policy. However, when Metropolitan Life Insurance denied her claim because her condition did not fit its disability criteria of the insurance policy, Fontaine sued the company. Her lawsuit alleged that Metropolitan Life Insurance's determination of ineligibility was conducted at random, and therefore should be subject to an impartial review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial ruling by the Illinois federal court was that state law permitted Fontaine to receive benefits de novo because she had provided enough evidence that proved her disability. Metropolitan Life Insurance argued that ERISA overruled Illinois state law because the denial of disability and insurance benefits was not done at random. Furthermore, MetLife argued that it was entitled to a deferential review and it decision should be given full force and effect because it had discretionary authority under the plan. Therefore, the company sought an appeal of the initial decision.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The appeals court rules in favor of Fontaine</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Illinois administrative regulation §2001.3 prohibits discretionary clauses in insurance contracts of the kind relied on by MetLife. The court cited the previous Ninth and Sixth Circuit court decisions which argued that ERISA did not override state laws that prohibit insurance companies to use discretionary clauses in determinations of insurance contracts. Metropolitan Life Insurance opposed the decision because it cited language under the ERISA plan that enabled such discretionary determinations to be made by the insurer. This point was refuted by the court because it determined that if discretionary clauses like this one were allowed to preempt state laws, then there would be nothing to prevent insurance companies from denying all disability claims. It also asserted that such language needed to be in the ERISA plan documents at the time the claimant signed off on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether Illinois administrative regulation §2001.3 regulates an insurance contract or an ERISA plan determined the level of deference given the decision of MetLife on Fontaine's claim. The court held §2001.3 regulated an insurance contract issued in the State of Illinois, thus MetLife was not entitled to deference and the matter would be subject to de novo review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court ultimately ruled that Metropolitan Life Insurance conducted a negligent denial of Fontaine's disability claim, and that she should receive the benefits under the terms of the insurance policy.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the case from a national perspective</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision follows other cases which hold that an insurance contract may be regulated by a state despite being issued to an ERISA plan. This means that decision of an insurance company denying a claim under an insurance contract will not receive deference that a decision of an ERISA plan administrator might otherwise receive.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he signed a new bill into law that would prohibit the state of New Jersey from subsidizing low-income property developers who defaulted on state loans. According to a report by the Washington Times, the bill was initially proposed after a company received <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/2/new-law-bans-tax-credits-for-firms-that-didnt-repa/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">several millions of dollars</span></a> from New Jersey while in default status for previously secured loans.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The details of the new law</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The governor signed the bill because he was adamant that the state should no longer be responsible for subsidizing these low-income property development companies that are either delinquent or late with loan repayments. According to a statement cited by <a href="http://nj.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">NJ.com</span></a>, Democratic Sen. Nicholas Scutari co-sponsored the bill because it was <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/christie_signs_bill_blocking_tax_breaks_to_busines.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">clear that a solution</span></a> needed to be found.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"We cannot reward companies that are behind on payments to the state, especially when it is coming at the taxpayers' expense," Scutari explained. "Just like any financial institution would evaluate its risk when considering loan applications, the state must do the same."</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The rationale behind the new law</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several companies in the state that are currently receiving loans from other agencies around New Jersey, despite owing the state government millions in loan debt. One prime example listed by the Washington Times was Roizman Development Inc., which is a Pennsylvania company that has <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/2/new-law-bans-tax-credits-for-firms-that-didnt-repa/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">received millions from two agencies</span></a> in New Jersey while it owed over $6 million in state government loan repayments. Roizman Development Inc. was the first property developer in New Jersey to secure state loans as part of the governor's incentive programs for low-income housing. The company then developed low-income housing in Camden, New Jersey as part of the 2013 Economic Opportunity Act. It secured a $57 million loan to rebuild 175 homes through several federal tax credits, a federal loan and $26 million in additional state construction loans from New Jersey. In turn, the project was approved for up to $23.4 million in loans and tax credits for Roizman Development Inc. over the course of the next 10 years. However, the company has been slow in its debt repayments, which spurred the state into action.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How it will impact companies in default status</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the law's enactment, all repayment on state government loans will be from rent for the properties. These funds will be secured from guaranteed rent payments from the federal government's Section 8 housing program.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division upheld a previous decision that intangible holding companies are not required to throw out any out-of-state receipts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a Reed Smith report, the Court ruled in <i>Lorillard Licensing Company</i> LLC v Director, Div. of Taxation that the state's economic nexus law is applicable in determining if a company is <a href="http://www.reedsmith.com/New-Jersey-Appellate-Court-Issues-Throwout-Ruling-12-04-2015/?utm_source=Mondaq&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=View-Original" target="_blank"><span class="s2">subject to state tax</span></a> in other jurisdictions as part of New Jersey's "Throw Out Rule." In what was ruled as a favorable decision for taxpayers, the corporation was required to pay lower state taxes on a subsidiary company as New Jersey could not raise its apportionment percentage.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the Throw Out Rule </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The state's Throw Out Rule was originally part of the 2002 Business Tax Reform Act that called upon companies to calculate receipts into the corporation business tax apportionment formula.  In essence, the numerator is receipts from a state and the denominator is receipts from all states. One problem is that not all states have a corporate income tax. The Court states that "The Throw-Out Rule modifies the sales fraction into one that divides New Jersey receipts only by taxed receipts."  If receipts are attributed to states where there is no corporation business tax, then the state tax <a href="http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/smokin-hot-new-jersey-throw-out-decision-82997/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">apportionment percentage increases</span></a> in New Jersey. Thus, by throwing out receipts from the denominator, the fraction increases the income that is subject to tax by New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a 2011 case, Whirlpool v. Director, the Appellate Court limited the application of the Throw Out Rule to operate constitutionally.  In that instance, the receipts that were thrown out were limited to receipts not taxed by another state because the taxpayer did not have the requisite level of contact with that state to permit it to exert taxing jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lorillard disputed the application of the Throw Out Rule rule by the New Jersey Division of Taxation. The company argued that in the determination of whether receipts are applicable or were required to be discounted from the denominator, the same economic nexus rule in Lanco, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation should have been applicable in this case. Lanco imposed tax upon an out-of-state intangible holding company that received a royalty for use of the intangibles in the state, Therefore, since the company would be subject to tax in those other jurisdictions, the receipts would not need to be discarded.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oppositely, the New Jersey Division of Taxation argued that the tax itself as well as the state's ability to tax companies, should be the primary determination for the applicability of the Throw Out Rule. Further, the Division of Taxation believed that the licensing agreement did not subject the company to taxation in other jurisdictions.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The court's decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Court ruled in favor of the company after it asserted that it was irrelevant if the corporation filed returns or paid taxes for those receipts in other jurisdictions. The Appellate Division then agreed with the Tax Court that the tax policies of other jurisdictions are not relevant. The only issue is whether another state could assert taxing jurisdiction in a manner that satisfied the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the ruling</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Division of Taxation may take its appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Its argument is that there is a constitutional question or that it has the discretion of the court to pursue an appeal based on the application of the Throw Out Rule. However, from a broader perspective, the decision may only resolve Throw Out issues for the determination of whether intangible holding companies have a nexus in the state because Lanco, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation only determined nexus for intangible holding companies with licensing agreements with in-state affiliates. On its face, the ruling does not address the application of the Throw Out Rule to traditionally operating businesses where Whirlpool remains relevant.</span></p>]]></content>

FIRPTA is the Foreign Interest In Real Property Tax Act and became law to force foreign sellers of U.S. real property to pay tax on gain from sales. Without FIRPTA, sellers would pocket the proceeds and remove themselves from the U.S. and its taxing jurisdiction. FIRPTA was designed to cause foreign sellers to file U.S. returns and report any gain.

The 2015 statute increased the withholding obligation imposed on buyers in transaction where the seller is a foreign person. The ten percent (10%) rate is increased to fifteen percent (15%) in any transaction where the buyer is not acquiring a principal residence from a foreign seller. The fifteen percent (15%) rate also applies if the sales price of a principal residence exceeds $1,000,000.
<h2>Exceptions to the increased rate</h2>
There are two exceptions to the increased rate of withholding. Where a buyer acquires a principal residence from a foreign seller for a sales price over $300,000 and less than or equal to $1,000,000, the ten percent rate will continue to apply. The acquisition of a principal residence from a foreign person for a sales price of $300,000 or less will not require withholding consistent with past practice. Withholding is also not required if a Seller  provides a Withholding Certificate from the IRS which excuses the withholding or the amount realized by the seller is zero.

The effective date is for all closings after February 15, 2016.

It is not uncommon for tax practitioners to uncover transactions where the Foreign Interests in Real Property have not been properly identified. A foreclosure on U.S. real property collateral securing a foreign loan, the arrangement may be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. Consistent with tax treaties, the sale of a real property is taxable by the host country. FIRPTA simply expands the definition to capture transactions that were designed to avoid U.S. tax.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All gifts may be subject to IRS gift taxes, and some of those rules are becoming more stringent next tax year. According to a Motley Fool report, a prime example of a gift <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax law</span></a> that has become more strict is when gifts are <a href="http://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/2015/11/15/the-tax-law-on-foreign-cash-gifts.aspx" target="_blank"><span class="s2">given between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens</span></a>. There are several issues taxpayers will need to take into account for all gifts, particularly from foreign cash gifts in 2016.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving gifts between U.S. and foreign citizens</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The way gift taxes work for foreign citizens and U.S. citizens is that both transactions are subject to the same threshold limits. For instance, for any gift that is given that is beyond the $14,000 annual exclusion amount, even foreign citizens must file a gift tax return so that the exceeding amount can be reported. A primary benefit of the gift tax exemption is that the annual exclusion amount has a lifetime exemption that applies beyond the time of the transaction. For 2016, the lifetime exemption threshold will be $5.45 million, so a sizable amount is required for gift tax liability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With regards to foreign citizens specifically, if these gifts are given to a spouse, there is an additional exemption that applies. The unlimited marital deduction enables spouses, even foreign citizens, to now have an annual $148,000 for 2016. However, if any gift between spouses of foreign citizens exceeds that threshold limit, the taxpayers must file gift tax returns. It is important to note, though, that these taxpayers can use the same lifetime exemption amount of $5.45 million.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">An important change on receiving gifts from foreign citizens or companies</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the unique factors of receiving gifts from foreign citizens is that the limitation amounts change. In 2016, taxpayers are still not subject to gift taxes on all gifts received, but they are required to report it on IRS Form 3520. For instance, if a gift received from a foreign citizen is in excess of $100,000, he or she must report it on IRS Form 3520. The important aspect of the new tax rules for next year is that gifts from overseas corporations or partnerships are subject to lower threshold limits because the gift values are adjusted for inflation every year. Next year, this limit will be $15,671.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some lawmakers in the New Jersey state legislature recently announced plans to remove incentives and cut contracts with U.S. companies that move offshore for tax purposes. According to a <a href="http://northjersey.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">NorthJersey.com</span></a> report, the proposed law changes are the direct result of Pfizer Inc.'s merger with Allergan PLC in Ireland in an <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/business/inversions-draw-criticism-1.1466802" target="_blank"><span class="s2">attempt to lower its corporate tax rate</span></a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The objective of the proposed legislation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The federal government recently announced changes to offshore disclosure and tax inversion laws to limit the corporate tax incentives. However, the <a href="http://northjersey.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">NorthJersey.com</span></a> report showed that New Jersey would be the first state in the country to <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/business/inversions-draw-criticism-1.1466802" target="_blank"><span class="s2">remove these contracts and incentives</span></a> for U.S. companies headquartered in their states. According to a <a href="http://northjersey.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">NorthJersey.com</span></a> interview with Sen. Shirley Turner, a Lawrenceville Democrat, this legislation would be an opposition to Gov. Chris Christie's push to the federal government to lower corporate taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"I want to send a strong message to Pfizer as well as any other corporate deserters looking to do the same thing," Turner explained. "They are parasites living off of our taxpayers, and it's not like they're going bankrupt by any means."</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the merger</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Allergan PLC and Pfizer Inc. merger is significant because the $160 billion partnership would create the largest corporate tax inversion in the world. As both companies have operating headquarters in New Jersey and Ireland, the merger makes sense from an operations standpoint, but it also represents a recent trend. Many U.S. companies have effectively completed tax inversions in Ireland in the last few years because of its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. Currently, the corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent. While many U.S. companies pay far less than the nominal rate, it still makes Ireland a desirable destination for larger domestic companies.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Criticism</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most significant arguments against this newly proposed legislation at the state level is that the federal government has not made corporate tax inversions less profitable. Therefore, if the federal government fails to address the problems that contribute to higher numbers of offshore tax evasion for larger companies, states like New Jersey do not have the resources to keep those tax dollars. In a statement cited by <a href="http://northjersey.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">NorthJersey.com</span></a>, Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokesperson, agreed with Christie's criticism of the proposed legislation because it only stimulates more corporate tax inversions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"This legislation discourages investment in New Jersey," Campion argued. "A reformed tax code that includes a territorial system would stimulate investment in the United States and allow American businesses to compete on a level playing field."</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Do you need to resolve a Federal tax lien?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/resolve-a-federal-tax-lien.jpg" alt="resolve a federal tax lien" width="408" height="408" />A Federal tax lien is not only a short-term financial burden, but the long-term effects are potentially <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendunn/2013/10/05/dealing-with-a-federal-tax-lien/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">devastating to consumer credit, employment and purchasing power</span></a>, tax attorney Stephen J. Dunn wrote in a recent Forbes article. The IRS maintains the lien for 10 years before a tax levy is placed on consumer assets, said Dunn, a civil tax and asset forfeiture litigation expert. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The importance of resolution</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tax lien is attached to all personal and business assets, which results in a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendunn/2013/10/05/dealing-with-a-federal-tax-lien/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">negative credit rating</span></a>. In turn, when this appears on consumer credit reports, a negative rating can adversely impact consumer ability to secure credit and future assets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The three major credit reporting agencies include notices of Federal tax liens (NFLTs) in the taxpayers' credit reports, affecting the taxpayer's credit standing," noted Dunn. "The Internal Revenue Service records NFTLs as a matter of practice, to prevent third parties who purchase property from the taxpayer, or lend money to the taxpayer taking a security interest in the taxpayer's property, from acquiring an interest in the taxpayer's property superior to the Federal tax lien."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Federal tax lien also accrues penalties and interest in addition to the tax amount owed, which can place consumers in crippling debt.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The effects of Federal tax liens</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cautionary example of the impact a tax lien can have on a consumer occurred with lobbyist Steven Pigeon, who has $244,000 in tax delinquencies, according to a recent report in Buffalo News. In addition to two <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/steven-pigeons-new-tax-lien-raises-total-owed-to-federal-government-to-244000-20150603" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax liens placed on his assets for $126,000 and $118,000</span></a>, his consulting firm has experienced numerous contractual cancelations that have hindered his ability to pay the tax delinquency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"As a result, Pigeon said two weeks ago that he was bolstering his new lobbying activities through a firm he and longtime associate Gary R. Parenti formed last year," the news source noted. "Chief among his new lobbying clients was the Seneca Nation of Indians, which announced Tuesday it was canceling its $180,000 contract with the Pigeon firm – PAPI Consulting LLC."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the IRS has negotiated a payment plan with Pigeon as part of their ongoing efforts to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc201.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">increase the threshold amount for tax liens filed</span></a>. This increased dollar threshold adjusts to inflationary changes, which enables high net worth individuals to have tax liens automatically filed at a fixed amount.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal tax lien resolution options</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consumers have several options to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Understanding-a-Federal-Tax-Lien" target="_blank"><span class="s2">resolve Federal tax lien status</span></a>, although withdrawal is chief among those alternatives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The IRS implemented something called the 'Fresh Start' initiative, which is a series of procedures and policy changes directed toward taxpayers facing collection from the IRS," noted the Fox Business website. "One of the changes includes a policy that allows certain taxpayers to request that their tax liens be withdrawn, even before the underlying tax debt has been paid." </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, with the federal tax lien withdrawal option, resolution is a readily available alternative for consumers.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/spendthrift-language.jpg" alt="spendthrift language" width="391" height="391" />Will Spendthrift Language In A Trust Always Be Respected?</h2>
The unequivocal answer to the question is: it depends.

The grantor’s purpose for including spendthrift language in a trust is to protect the trust assets set from the beneficiary’s creditors and to prevent the beneficiary from selling or assigning his or her interest in the trust.
<h2>Pfannenstiehl</h2>
<em>Pfannenstiehl</em> is a Massachusetts divorce case that made its way to the state’s highest court where   the lower court decision was affirmed by a 3-2 vote. The husband’s parents established the trust for their three children and funded the trust with stock of a closely held corporation. The father and his twin brother are officers and directors of the corporation and the brother is one trustee. The other trustee is the family attorney.

The trial court held the trust was not administered impartially as distributions were cutoff as the divorce loomed. The trial court held that the husband had a present enforceable right to distributions and his interest was vested in possession. The court felt that the ascertainable standard in the trust instrument obligated the trustees to maintain the standard of living of the beneficiary and there was an established pattern of making substantial distributions prior to the divorce. The distribution figures were between $50,000 and $80,000 for five years before the divorce.

Furthermore, the statute gives the trial judge discretion, based on a number of factors, what property to include in a marital estate and it may include intangibles and assets to be acquired.
<h2>Tannen v. Tannen</h2>
In New Jersey, <u>Tannen</u> v. <u>Tannen,</u>   raised the issue when counsel for a divorcing husband convinced a trial judge that the trust, created for his wife by her parents, should be deemed available to the wife for purposes of reducing the husband’s support obligation. The court relied on language in the fourth revision to the Uniform Trust Code (UTC) that created a vested right. The decision was reversed on appeal and the court held that, until the legislature adopts the fourth revision of the Uniform Trust Code, the prior version of the UTC remains in force.
<h2>The take-away</h2>
What do these cases teach us? First, state law matters. Second, whether a state has adopted a restated version of the Uniform Trust Code may be significant. Third, does administration of the trust lie in the hands of family or a professional trustee? Would the <em>Pfannenstiehl</em> trust have fared better if the trustees moved the trust to Delaware engaged a professional trustee before resigning? We may never know but consideration should be given to a change of situs to a state with a directed trust statute. The father and his brother could have continued to manage the business leaving the trustees to deal with distributions.

One other point should be noted is that husband and wife had two children with disabilities. Clearly, the wife, as custodial parent, was a sympathetic figure to the trial court. Another point is that the court awarded the wife $1.3 million notwithstanding that the class of beneficiaries was not closed to descendants of the grantor’s children. One dissent argued it was not possible to determine the husband’s interest with the certainty required for division of a marital asset.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, in the case of a Michigan law office, the Sixth Circuit Court upheld a decision to penalize the law firm for not filing a Form 5330, Return of Excise Taxes Related to Employee Benefit Plans. According to a Bloomberg BNA report, the court ruled that the firm was penalized for reasonably acknowledging that it had <a href="http://www.bna.com/sixth-circuit-caves-b57982058739/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">not paid its taxes</span></a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the initial case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law office established an employee stock ownership plan in 1998, a Law 360 report explained. This ESOP is a retirement plan that owns securities of the employer that sponsors the program. Then, after the principal established the ESOP, he transferred his ownership to the plan. At the time, ESOPs at S corps like the firm in question were exempt from taxes on income attributable to stocks held in the ESOP until it was distributed. As the principal and his firm were exempt from taxes, there were <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/700481/6th-circ-won-t-revive-law-firm-s-suit-over-excise-tax" target="_blank"><span class="s2">no returns filed</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, in 2001, Congress amended the provisions, giving taxpayers a six-month grace period to make back payments and ensure compliance. This provision was amended to combat tax abuses by S corporations that established ESOP programs that were designed to benefit a few key personnel rather than large groups of employees. Congress imposed a 50 percent excise tax on S corp. ESOP programs that did not have employee ownership. Ultimately though, the law firm did not comply within the grace period.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further complicating the case was the fact that the IRS waited until 2011 to collect the excise tax - which was over $200,000 - that resulted from the firm's decision not to come into compliance. In the initial case, the court found that Section 4979A, which enforces the excise tax, governed the statute of limitations, and that the time had expired for the IRS to impose the tax.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The court's initial ruling</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court initially found the IRS was required to adhere to a three-year statute of limitations imposed under Section 4979A. However, when the court reconsidered the case, it ruled that the IRS should have applied a different tax code section. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, the court found that the statute of limitations never expired because the law firm never properly filed the necessary tax form for the ESOP, which meant that the statute of limitations never started.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the Sixth Circuit Court's decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lesson for taxpayers, particularly S corps, is that in order to benefit from the three-year statute of limitations, it is crucial that they file the necessary tax form - even if they did not need to when they established the ESOP. Taking this one step further, the guidance for taxpayers in general is that they should file tax returns, even if they believe in good faith that they are tax exempt. It is best that the IRS is provided with the information so that they can calculate any potential taxes.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PLR-201302009.jpg" alt="PLR 201302009" width="404" height="404" />PLR 201302009 &amp; avoiding cancellation of indebtedness on underwater property</h2>
Private letter rulings (PLR) offer insight into where certain boundaries lie. PLR often provide solutions to problems that practitioners are likely to encounter.

PLR 201302009 offers a solution to a common problem faced by many real estate operators for borrowers whose property is underwater. The solution is a like-kind exchange; however, it may not be useful to all operators, but it does offer a way out to taxpayers who are able to arrange new financing on a purchase of replacement property.

The problem in a like-kind exchange is that relief of indebtedness is treated as the receipt of cash, which is boot and must be recognized as income. Fortunately, taxpayers are permitted to net liabilities. The debt on the relinquished property a taxpayer is relieved of debt is offset against the new debt being assumed and cash down payment given in connection with the replacement property. This netting is the key to avoiding phantom gain from relief of indebtedness.
<h2>What does this mean for the taxpayer?</h2>
The PLR states that the value of the replacement property is approximately equal to the amount of debt on the relinquished property. It may not be possible to find suitable replacement properties let alone find one that will qualify for financing in an amount equal to the debt on the relinquished property. Although not stated in the PLR, the taxpayer probably had the wherewithal to come up cash to fund the balance of the purchase price. One must assume that the new lender was not inclined to fund the entire purchase. Thus, this solution may be of little use to taxpayers in deep financial distress.

The mechanics of the exchange are relatively straightforward with the exception that the consent of the lenders to the relinquished property was secured, no doubt, beforehand. This taxpayer is engaged in extensive negotiations with his or her lenders, identified replacement property, obtained new financing and a private letter ruling.

In addition to the cash payment on the replacement property, all of this suggests a well above-average taxpayer with resources and foresight. Those in distress may not have the cash nor the forbearance of its lenders to carry-out a similar plan. This may be a solution for taxpayers able to service their debt but who are looking to address the issue of an underwater property.]]></content>

One of the hallmarks of international tax planning is the ability to obtain a tax ruling from a foreign revenue services that the taxpayer is a qualified resident for income tax treaty purposes. Such a ruling permits a taxpayer to proceed with certainty in establishing operations. It allows a taxpayer to understand what dividends and interest will flow free or withholding taxes.
<h2><em>Starr</em><em> International</em></h2>
<em><u>Starr</u></em><em> <u>International</u></em> (“Starr”) is an interesting case for a number of reasons. In early February of this year, the United States motioned the court to reconsider its prior ruling that the IRS “consult” with its Swiss counterparts prior to any final decision to grant treaty benefits. The government argues that separation-of-powers principles prevent the Court from forcing the IRS to consult with the Swiss authorities or dictating the outcome of any consultation because doing so would impinge on the Executive's authority to conduct foreign relations.

In 2015, the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia held that Starr, a Panamanian company tax resident in Switzerland, was permitted to proceed with its case on the issue of whether the government abused its discretion in denying Starr’s application for a ruling that Starr was entitled to a treaty qualification ruling that it was a eligible for benefits under the U.S.- Swiss Treaty. In denying the request for a ruling, the government did not consult with its Swiss counterpart. Starr contended that this was an abuse of discretion.
<h2>The ruling</h2>
At stake was $38 million dollars that was withheld from a 2007 U.S. source dividend because Starr did not qualify for treaty benefits. Starr claimed that nearly all of the economic value of Starr was vested in non-voting common stock owned by a Swiss formed charity that was owned by a Swiss Foundation. The voting common and preferred was owned by individuals, all but two of which were U.S. citizens. Starr and the government agreed that Starr did not satisfy the mechanical tests for a ruling under the Limitation of Benefits (LOB) provisions of the treaty.

While the case will proceed on the basis that the government’s discretion is not reviewable, there are other significant points. First, the structure was designed to put more than 50% of the value in foreign ownership. Second, the voting common and preferred shares could not impair the value of the class of non-voting common without its consent. It is unclear whether the Starr was structured in 1943 to avoid U.S taxation and its reaction to the 1962 change in the law which introduced of Subpart F and the Controlled Foreign Corporation status.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IRS-list-of-22Bad-Banks22.jpg" alt="IRS list of bad banks" width="400" height="400" />The IRS List of "Bad Banks"</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS updated its list of "Bad Banks" last month, which is now up to 95 banking institutions. This list will continue to grow as Swiss banks and foreign financial institutions come under more intense scrutiny from the Department of Justice to force public disclosure. So if your client's bank is on the list, he or she should be made aware that the current Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program penalty is now 50 percent. It is vital to disclose all necessary information before it is too late.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">OVDP: The offshore penalties continue to grow</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS increased the offshore disclosure penalty percentage from <a href="http://profbrunettistaxnews.blogspot.com/2016/03/irs-list-of-foreign-financial.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">27.5 percent to 50 percent last year</span></a>, according to Professor Frank L. Brunetti's Tax News blog. What this meant was that taxpayers could avoid the 50 percent offshore disclosure penalty if they submit a pre-clearance letter to the IRS before a financial institution came under investigation for public disclosure. But the penalties for not submitting this pre-clearance letter before a public disclosure are strict.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, let's say your client has assets in a foreign bank account valued at $3 million and an additional $4 million in offshore real estate purchased with the assets from that offshore account. That $7 million would be subject to a 50 percent penalty, which would be $3.5 million. This is significant because the previous 27.5 percent would have still been a substantial amount, but only $1,925,000. So your client would be required to pay an additional $1,575,000. No small chunk of change. Especially when you consider that there is also the risk that during the investigation your client could lose the OVDP criminal amnesty - all because you client did not submit a pre-clearance letter.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The OVDP targeting Swiss bank accounts</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certainly it is no secret that Swiss banks figure prominently in the top 10 on the IRS list of "Bad Banks" and this is partly due to the settlement reached between the Department of Justice and the Swiss banking system in 2014. This settlement led to the public disclosure of more than 300 U.S. account holders with more than $2 trillion in assets within the Swiss banking system. Needless to say, the Swiss are expected to continue to be a target of the IRS and the Department of Justice in the coming years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing your client needs to consider is that the IRS will not accept ignorance as a plea anymore, regardless of where your client owes taxes on those assets. In addition, if you yourself have come to find that your bank is on this "Bad Banks" list, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">consult an experienced tax attorney</a> for advice.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS has strict rules for what constitutes a partnership. Under Section 761(a), a partnership as defined by the IRS needs to involve ''a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization through or by means of which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, and which is not, within the meaning of this title, a corporation or a trust or estate." </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a recent article published by Scarinci &amp; Hollenbeck's Tax Notes, attorneys John H. Skarbnik and Frank Brunetti stated that this definition is significant for those entities conducting business as partners because the language dictated in any agreement <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Compensatory-Distribution-of-Partnership-Interests.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">does not necessarily constitute a partnership, whereas its actions do</span></a>. For this reason, the IRS can dispute the existence of a partnership if it believes that a service provider in a partnership received ordinary income instead of capital gains on the receipt of a distribution. The IRS does not recognize the existence of a partnership in these cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, the IRS upheld its definition of what constitutes a partnership in <i>United States v. Stewart</i>, but the case that was cited in that decision involved a similar partnership relationship.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In March 2003, Hydrocarbon Capital LLC purchased a portfolio of oil and gas properties from Mirant Corp. At which point, Hydrocarbon retained Mirant's five executives who managed those properties, and these individuals formed Odyssey Capital Energy LP. This entity formed an agreement with Hydrocarbon - but the parties insisted this was not a partnership. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For its part in the agreement, Odyssey would oversee all exploration and production activity at the oil and gas properties with the intent of selling the properties under the Mirant umbrella. Upon sale of any of the properties, the five partners in Odyssey would ensure that Hydrocarbon was repaid all expenses, received a 10 percent return on its investment and recouped the full $6 million loan it gave to Odyssey. At which point, Odyssey would receive 20 percent of all remaining profits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A year later, Hydrocarbon sold the properties after it recouped all expenses, return on investment and the loan. Odyssey then received $20,106,410, which it reported on its 2004 tax return as ordinary income. Each of the five partners also filed this income under Schedule K-1. However, in 2006, the five partners inexplicably filed an amended partnership return for $20,432,323 as capital gains. The partners then issued amended Schedule K-1 to be sent to the other partners. These partners finally filed for refund claims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result of these actions, two partners received refunds of $1,333,067 and $520,222. The federal government then sued the two partners to return the refunds because it ruled they were issued in error. Since Odyssey simply managed Hydrocarbon's properties, it did not constitute a partnership, as was originally agreed upon - despite the amended partnership returns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In turn, the IRS argued that Odyssey was set to receive 20 percent of profits as compensation for the services provided. This income should have been taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains as the partners' amended tax returns suggested. Furthermore, the IRS also reiterated that Hydrocarbon did not file a partnership tax return with Odyssey.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The court ruled that a partnership existed between Hydrocarbon and Odyssey for a few reasons. For one thing, it determined that partnerships for tax purposes are not dependent on contract language. The actions of the relationships are the overarching factor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What the court argued was that Odyssey was not earning commission for sales of each property, like a car salesperson. Their ownership interest from Mirant into the value of the operation took precedence over the contract language between Odyssey and Hydrocarbon. Therefore, because the relationship between the two entities was that Hydrocarbon provided the properties and the financial backing, and Odyssey contributed its expertise in asset management, there was a clear partnership.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both parties contributed an equal amount of value to the properties. So the equity that Odyssey earned should be considered capital gains because it increased the capital value of the portfolio. Since the partners had a purchased share in the properties, they earned significant profits for Hydrocarbon after each property was sold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, execution and financing form a partnership, and the profits for both parties should be considered long-term capital gains. This meant that the federal government could not sue the two partners for re-characterizing their income refunded to them as capital gains. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tax simplification has been a popular topic around Washington recently. But on April 13, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., introduced legislation that may take a big step toward it. According to a CPA Practice Advisor report, the "Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016," would require the IRS to create a <a href="http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12196240/bill-would-simplify-income-tax-filing" target="_blank"><span class="s2">free service online for tax preparation and filing</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would involve the IRS preparing tax returns for taxpayers, which would effectively eliminate tax returns. In turn, taxpayers would still be allowed to send the IRS tax information provided to them by a third party prior to the completion of their returns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warren's bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The rationale behind the proposal</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warren argued in a statement that the bill was proposed to eliminate peoples' reliance on the tax preparation industry to complete their tax returns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes each year, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry," Warren commented in the statement. "The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill that would help taxpayers all across this country file their taxes with less stress and fewer costs, and it would push the IRS to use the authority it already has to simplify Tax Day for all Americans."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, Warren released a report with the proposed bill that showed the costs incurred by taxpayers in filing their returns with third parties. There was also an element of danger in sharing personal proprietary information with private third party companies. This was a point highlighted with the Free File Alliance as an example.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://freefilealliance.org/" target="_blank">The Free File Alliance</a> is a network of tax software vendors that partners with the IRS. But Warren argued that it is only used by 3 percent of taxpayers and offers several - and potentially unnecessary - products to unwitting taxpayers.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Critics of the proposal</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Opposition to the bill argued that it is an attempt to remove representation for taxpayers. It would effectively put taxpayers in direct contact with the IRS. Other detractors supported this point by explaining that there is a general lack of trust in the IRS. Perhaps the most vocal lobbies yet to comment on the bill are the Republicans in Congress and tax product vendors, who stand to lose the most.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Free File Alliance has initially objected to the proposed legislation and Warren's follow-up report findings. It pointed out that the bill would put the IRS as a single entity responsible for tax preparation, collection, auditing and enforcing.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bottom line</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The proposal has great significance for tax practitioners. Despite the fact that tax planning will still be an option for taxpayers, the legislation would dramatically change the tax preparation industry as we know it.</span></p>]]></content>

Commissioner, the Court Deems Split-Dollar Arrangements are not Subject to Gift Taxes</h2>
A recent Tax Court decision has potentially groundbreaking results. In <em>Estate of Morrissette v. Commissioner</em>, the Court ruled that the economic benefit regime applies to this split-dollar arrangement because the only economic benefit conferred upon three trusts was the value of current life insurance protection. The IRS sought to deny treatment under the economic benefit regime and to treat the $29M of funds advanced by the decedent as gifts.  If treated as a gift, the decedent, who died in 2009, would have had to file a gift tax return in 2006 and pay $13.8M of tax.
<h2>The details of the case</h2>
The decedent’s revocable living trust (RLT) advanced $29m to three trusts, described by the Court as Dynasty Trusts (DTs). The DTs used the $29m to make lump sum (one-time) premium payments for six universal life insurance policies. The lives of the decedent’s three sons were insured.  The trust for the descendants of Son A owned two policies, one each on the lives of Sons B and C. This pattern repeats itself for the other DTs. The DTs executed collateral assignments of the policies to RLT. The DTs owned the policies; however, neither the DTs nor the RLT retained the right to borrow against the policies.

Upon death of an insured (son), the RLT would receive the greater of the cash surrender value of the policy or the aggregate premiums paid.  The DTs would receive the death benefit reduced by the payment to the RLT.  Each DT, would use the remaining proceeds to purchase stock in the family business held by the deceased brother.  Thus the buy-sell feature would be accomplished passing the family business down to the decedent’s grandchildren.

There were three planning alternatives, some of which were impractical. First, the decedent would make an outright gift of $29M and pay gift tax at 40% of the gift. The second alternative would have the decedent or her RLT loan $29m.to the DTs (the “Loan Regime”).  The $29M loan would be an asset of the decedent’s estate and there would be interest charges so this option is unattractive for income tax and cash flow reasons. The third alternative was to confer upon the DTs only the value of current life insurance protection and utilize the economic benefit regime. Thus, each year before her death, the mother reported a gift equal to the cost of current life insurance protection.  In four years, she made gifts of $740,000 using Table 2001 under Treas. Reg. 1.61-22. Remember, neither the DTs nor the RLT retained the right to borrow against the policies.
<h2>Deemed ownership vs. legal title</h2>
In order to use Table 2001, the RLT would have to be deemed to be the owner of the policies.  Deemed ownership for split-dollar arrangements is different than legal title.  Deemed ownership by the RLT arises where the only benefit to the DTs is value of the current life insurance protection.  Taking away the DTs right to borrow from the cash surrender value of the policies caused the RLT to be the owner under the exception.  The DTs would have been treated as the owners of the policies if the DTs received any benefit other than current life insurance protection thus causing the loan regime to apply under the general rule. The result in this case is that $29M was made available to Dynasty Trusts at a tax cost that was fraction of the dollars advanced.

The decedent’s estate was entitled to be paid, but the amount and timing were unknown at her death.  Each one of three individual insureds had a life expectancy in excess of twenty years.  Furthermore, the RLT could not access the cash surrender value at the mother’s death. The appraiser valued the right to be repaid at $7.5M, which was the value reported in the taxable estate.  Once must remember that without planning, $29M would have been subject to estate tax.
<h2>The significance of the decision</h2>
The case has game-changing implications for the tax, wealth planning and insurance sectors because it may lead to intergenerational split-dollar arrangements. This would make it easier for family assets to pass into dynasty trusts and through generations by extracting assets from the estate and gift tax system.

Split-dollar arrangements have been used for decades as a method for paying life insurance premiums. A prime example of the use of a split-dollar arrangement occurs with a closely-held or family-owned company. To provide funding for a buyout and paying estate taxes on the stock in the company, the business owner would establish a trust so that money could be transferred to the trust from the company (or wealthy individual). The trust then purchases life insurance for the business owner and the company has a split-dollar receivable.

In the event that the business owner dies, the trust would collect the death benefit and pay back the company. The trust may loan the remaining funds to surviving business owners to complete the purchase under the buy-sell agreement, purchase the shares itself or loan the money to the estate to pay death taxes. The keys are to utilize a cash rich person or entity at minimal tax cost  and to avoid having both the business and the proceeds included in the taxable estate.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thiessen-v-Commissioner.jpg" alt="Thiessen v Commissioner" width="400" height="400" />Thiessen v Commissioner: A Self-Directed IRA or a Self-Inflicted Wound</h2>
Recently, myself and another attorney in the firm met with accountants from a well-established practice with several offices. When I inquired about the biggest problems they encountered in tax season, they replied that it was the use of self-directed IRAs to finance business acquisitions. They described the problem as an epidemic caused by the sluggishness of the economy in the parts of New Jersey served by their offices.

Self-directed IRAs are not new nor are they prohibited. The facts in <a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/ustcinop/opinionviewer.aspx?ID=10693" target="_blank"><em>Thiessen v Commissioner, </em>a Tax Court case</a>, are typical of the circumstances described to us in that recent meeting.
<h2>The Facts of Thiessen v Commissioner</h2>
In <em>Thiessen v Commissioner, </em>taxpayers did not want to accept a transfer to a Kroger location in another state. Taxpayers rolled over their respective Kroger 401K account balances to self-directed IRAs. Taxpayers looked for a business to acquire and encountered a broker who located one suited to their skills. A friend recommended a CPA who advised an acquisition structure whereby the 401K account balances would be rolled over to self-directed IRAs (“IRAs”). These transfers in 2003 were reported as tax-free rollovers. The CPA formed a C corporation for the taxpayers. Then, the taxpayers directed the IRAs to purchase all of the stock of a C corporation and then cause the C corporation to acquire the business.

The taxpayers had an attorney to represent them regarding the purchase but he did not participate in establishing the structure, nor did he have ties to the CPA or the broker. The CPA was not involved in drafting the contract of sale nor in the negotiation of the financing terms.
<h2>Issues down the road</h2>
The taxpayers transferred $432,000 to their IRAs and then directed the IRAs to purchase of all shares of stock of the new corporation. The contract of sale called for a purchase price of about $600,000 consisting of $60,000 of a deposit, a $200,000 Note (the “Note”) and the $340,000 balance in cash from the IRAs (presumably from the C corporation). The deposit came from the personal bank account of the taxpayers and the government did not raise the source of these funds as a tax issue. The Note required and contained the personal guarantee of the taxpayers.

In 2010, seven years after the acquisition, the taxpayers received a tax deficiency notice for $180,000 based upon the disqualification of the IRAs in 2003. Disqualification was based upon the fact that the guarantee of the Note by the taxpayers was a prohibited transaction. A prohibited transaction includes the indirect lending of money or extension of credit between a plan and a disqualified person. The later term includes a fiduciary who is one who exercises discretionary authority or control over plan assets. The court held that the guaranties constituted indirect extensions of credit between the taxpayers and the IRAs. The distinction here is that the taxpayer guaranties added to the value of the assets held in the IRAs and circumvented contribution limitations.

The irony here is that the CPA was also involved in a 2013 case, <a href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/PeekandFleck.TC.WPD.pdf" target="_blank">Peek v. Commissioner</a>, that taxpayers also lost. One should also know that the government had other arguments that the Court did not rule upon. A reader should not read <em>Thiessen</em> as giving the government only one line of attack.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/New-Overtime-Wage-and-Hour-Rules.jpg" alt="New Overtime Wage and Hour Rules" width="400" height="400" />The Department of Labor (DOL) has made an important announcement on new overtime wage and hour rules</h2>
The long-awaited Department of Labor ruling <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-wage-and-hour-rules-published-today-most-employers-must-comply-december-1-2016" target="_blank">bringing on new overtime wage and hour rules was just made public</a>, according to The National Law Review. This will mean that certain positions within a company may now be subject to overtime pay, which could significantly increase wages, effective Dec. 1 of this year.

While the salary thresholds are slightly less than the originally proposed amount, the new figure is set to double the current minimum wages for overtime pay.

<a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/dol-overtime-regulations-will-impact-employers" target="_blank">Now more than ever, companies need to examine their operations</a> to assess wage increases and the potential impact of reclassification of certain positions to non-exempt status. Furthermore, companies need to consider how these rule changes will affect exempt employees within their organizational structure.
<h2>The potential impact</h2>
With a significantly higher wage threshold as part of the new rules, many companies may prefer to switch their wage structure from salaries to hourly workers. This will enable them to accurately track work hours more carefully. The rules will also prompt companies to keep a closer eye on work hours for non-exempt employees as they approach 40 hours per week.

Perhaps the biggest impact will be on productivity. Companies may bring in part-time workers to account for the productivity gap created by non-exempt employees. This is particularly true for smaller businesses that cannot afford overtime. The rules may also force some companies to reduce wages due to the increased overtime pay, which will be the equivalent of time and a half.
<h2>The new rules</h2>
The salary threshold works as such: <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/" target="_blank">workers are entitled to overtime pay</a> that is equal to the 40th percentile of weekly earnings generated by full-time employees in the lowest wage bracket in the country. That will increase the salary threshold for full-time employees who make $23,666 per year to $47,476. Per week, that works out to a bump from $455 to $913. Finally, the new rule will also raise the salary threshold on the "highly salaried employee" exemption to $134,004 per year. These salary thresholds will then be subject to revisions every three years, which may very well mean increases.
<h2>What companies should do</h2>
Upon implementation of the rule, there will be a grace period. Currently, that grace period will be 60 days from its publication in the Federal Register, which was set for May 23. It is assumed that the government may extend the grace period to as much as 120 days after publication, but that is yet to be determined.

Regardless, this is still a very short amount of time to adjust to such a major change. So companies should examine how their previously exempt positions will be affected. They may also elect to increase wage levels, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">convert exempt positions to non-exempt and vice versa</a> or restructure their entire organization to reflect the changes. The new salary requirements may prompt many companies to avoid overtime pay altogether within their payroll systems. These companies will also need to file written notice as part of state law if they commit to any of the changes listed above.]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, there was a significant fraudulent transfer ruling made based on whether the actual fraud bar to discharge under Section 523(a)(2)(A) of <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/bankruptcy-and-creditors-rights/" target="_blank">the Bankruptcy Code applies</a> solely if a debtor has made a false representation, or also if he or she obtained money through a fraudulent asset transfer scheme to deliberately defraud a creditor. The Supreme Court reversed previous decisions after it ruled that an actual fraud exception to bankruptcy debt discharge <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/05/16/justices-reverse-5th-circ-bankruptcy-decision.htm" target="_blank"><span class="s2">does in fact include fraudulent asset transfers</span></a>, Courthouse News reported.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The background of the case</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The case involved Husky International Electronics and Chrysalis Manufacturing Corp. According to The Wall Street Journal, Husky claimed that <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/05/17/high-court-takes-broad-view-of-fraud-in-bankruptcy-cases/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Chrysalis owed it $164,000</span></a> for goods delivered as part of a contract. However, from 2006 to 2007, Daniel Ritz, the director of Chrysalis, transferred money from the company to other entities he owned. Due to this, Husky then sued Ritz for the outstanding $164,000. In response, Ritz filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Subsequently, the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Ritz because he did not falsely represent his company. What this meant was that he did not perpetrate a fraudulent transfer scheme against Husky. At the time, the determination of a fraudulent asset transfer scheme was dependent on the identification of false representation. So the court asserted that Ritz did not commit actual fraud against Husky under Texas' "piercing the corporate veil" law.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Southern Texas district court later affirmed this decision after it agreed that Husky did not clearly identify false representation or actual fraud. In fact, in May of last year, the Fifth Circuit court upheld these prior decisions after it found no exceptions to the false representation rule. The court asserted that there were no applicable exceptions to discharge the alleged debt from Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. However, this decision may have triggered a key turning point after Judge Carolyn King stated that there were applicable exceptions in the bankruptcy code that may have helped Husky's case, but they were not raised in the case.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Supreme Court reverses their frauduluent transfer ruling decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the Fifth Circuit court's decision, Husky then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court - a case the high court subsequently agreed to hear. The justices then reversed the Fifth Circuit's decision by ruling 7-1 that actual fraud does include fraudulent transfer schemes, even if those tactics do not involve false representation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The high court claimed that Ritz' interpretation of the actual fraud law created an applicable exception to discharge the alleged debt from bankruptcy. In its ruling, the Court explained that it treated Ritz just as it would a fiduciary professional who created a fraudulent transfer scheme - therefore, it did not need to create an artificial definition of actual fraud to apply it to this case.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, the Court also identified flaws in the reasoning of Ritz' argument that actual fraud in the federal bankruptcy code was designed to limit the reach of debt discharge exceptions. False pretenses, false representation and actual fraud are not made clear by the definition in the bankruptcy code, and therefore they are not required to determine fraudulent transfer.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Significance of the decision</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The high court's ruling expands the previous perspectives on fraud and what types of fraudulent transfers will prevent a debtor from getting a fresh start by <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/bankruptcy-and-creditors-rights/" target="_blank">filing for bankruptcy protection</a>. This is regarded as both a positive and negative development in the legal sector. Some critics feel the Court's opinion has the potential for consequences in the expansion of the actual fraud definition. Others in favor of the decision claim that it is a step in the right direction toward eliminating bankruptcy as a mechanism for fraud.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/engagement-letters.jpg" alt="engagement letters" width="400" height="400" />When should you implement engagement letters?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many practicing accountants, their main cause of litigation is the result of client allegations that they failed to perform a scope of services that may or may not have been outside their engagement. According to Accounting Web, <a href="http://www.accountingweb.com/community-voice/blogs/admin/some-reasons-for-delivering-engagement-letters" target="_blank">this is where engagement letters come into play</a> for CPAs because it enables them to protect themselves from liability. An engagement letter is best practice to eliminate doubts over the scope of agreed-upon services between the client and accountant - and thus significantly reduce risk of litigation.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1">However, do you really need to use engagement letters?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to research cited in a Bloomberg BNA report by Sarah Beckett Ference, CPA and risk control director at CNA Insurance, <a href="http://www.bna.com/engagement-letter-cpas-b57982067800/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">49 percent of CPA firms in the AICPA Professional Liability Insurance Program</span></a> that had professional liability claims brought against them did not use engagement letters. The reason? These contracts were deemed to be an administrative burden, so it is not a required practice at many firms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The issue is that in lieu of a properly drafted contract, lawsuits can prove to be even more of an administrative nightmare, as well as costly and time-consuming. Appropriately customized engagement letters detailing the practice and scope of services decreases the potential for controversy and greatly improves the odds of favorable resolutions.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Some benefits of engagement letters</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most significant misconceptions about the value of the engagement letter is that third parties can also bring lawsuits against a CPA firm. Third parties such as investors, vendors and lenders can sue accountants for malpractice if they rely on a firm's accounting work. This is where engagement letters can reduce the audience who is meant to rely on the services. That is a crucial clause in an engagement letter because third party rights to sue vary from state to state, so this is where expert legal assistance is important. A prime example of what CPAs can do if third party rights to sue are limited in their jurisdiction is to require the client to indemnify, which would effectively remove any liability for the accountant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another benefit of engagement letters is that provisions can be added to mandate alternative dispute resolution in the event of a claim brought against a firm. These ADRs could potentially cut out thousands of dollars in liabilities to client or third party claims. With the CPA's insurer's approval, accountants can include language in the engagement letters to involve ADRs like arbitration or mediation.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The bottom line on engagement letters</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are no certainties that engagement letters can completely protect CPA firms against client or third party claims. But the use of these contracts can at the very least provide a detailed list of accurate information regarding the services they have retained the accountant to perform, the limitations of those services, and the responsibilities of both the accountant and the clients arising from the engagement. By bridging the information and expectation gaps, firms can cover their bases against many issues that lead to professional liability claims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is why CPAs should <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">consult with knowledgeable attorneys to prepare engagement letters</a> that cover the scope of services provided to clients in order to ensure their effectiveness.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new study by <span class="s2"><a href="http://taxaudit.com/">TaxAudit.com</a>,</span> cited by the Motley Fool, found that <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/04/if-you-live-in-these-states-youre-at-a-higher-risk.aspx?source=iaasitlnk0000003" target="_blank"><span class="s2">certain states have higher audit rates</span></a> than others. The report's cumulative rankings were based on the results of <span class="s2">TaxAudit.com's</span> Audit Defense consumers in 2014 who were eventually audited in 2015.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The study's state-by-state findings</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among the 1.5 million tax returns analyzed by <span class="s2">TaxAudit.com</span>, Vermont and California had the highest IRS audits per capita in 2015 for their 2014 tax returns. The report also found that Hawaii and New York had the most state audits per capita for their 2014 tax returns. Meanwhile, Oklahoma was found to have the lowest number of IRS audits per capita, and Texas with the least state audits in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The top ten states with the highest number of IRS audits after Vermont and California included Nevada, Massachusetts, Delaware, Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Florida and New Hampshire. Interestingly, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Massachusetts appear on the top ten list of audits per capita conducted by the state. Following Hawaii and New York in the state audit top ten list were Delaware, Michigan, Massachusetts, Alabama, New Jersey, District of Columbia, Pennsylvania and Montana.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why were taxpayers in these states targeted for audits?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the results point to a connection between the state and its likelihood of federal and state tax audits, there is no direct correlation. However, there are some specific reasons why taxpayers in these states are more likely the target of audits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most notably among these reasons is income. The IRS statistically audits more taxpayers in the higher income brackets. This was evident in the <span class="s2">TaxAudit.co1m</span> report as four of the top ten states audited by the IRS comprised the top 20 percent of household income in the U.S. in 2014. In fact, only Florida and Nevada were not in the top 50 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This occurs for many reasons, mainly because there is the potential to generate more tax revenue for the IRS and the states. According to research cited by CPA Practice Advisor, 16 percent of tax returns audited by the IRS belonged to taxpayers with more than $10 million in household income in 2014. So while all tax brackets get audited, even those under the $25,000 threshold, income correlates directly to tax audits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reasons behind the state audits are much tougher to pin down. Presumably, income is a factor. But each state's revenue department has varying levels of resources to carry out more audits. So if one state had more personnel in its internal revenue department, they would be able to execute more audits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All told, there are no hard and fast rules behind the IRS and state audits. Certain states are targeted for unique reasons. The <span class="s2">TaxAudit.com</span> report uses Hawaii as an example: It may have a higher audit rate per capita because taxpayers writeoff {as a verb it's two words}their work-related expenses for moving to the state. Since these relocation costs are higher than for most states, the deductions may be targeted for audits.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fiduciary-definition.jpg" alt="fiduciary definition" width="400" height="400" />The DOL amended the fiduciary definition</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Department of Labor recently issued its final regulations to alter the definition of a fiduciary under ERISA effective Apr. 10, 2017. These "conflict of interest" rules <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-law/" target="_blank">will expand ERISA protections</a> for participants by broadening the personnel treated as fiduciaries which render fee-based investment advice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the new rules, the DOL intends to redefine fiduciary investment advice by requiring advisers for ERISA-governed retirement plans and IRAs to act within <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/employee-benefits-erisa-law/" target="_blank">the definition of ERISA</a>. This move was also intended to summarize the code of conduct for investment advisers specific to provisions for ERISA plan sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the final regulations are geared toward investment advisers, they will significantly affect plan sponsors themselves.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The new </span><span class="s1">ERISA </span><span class="s1">fiduciary </span><span class="s1">definition </span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advisers are categorized as fiduciaries rendering investment advice when they offer suggestions to plans, plan fiduciaries, participants, beneficiaries and IRA account owners. According to the National Law Review, these recommendations from advisers are deemed investment advice <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dol-releases-final-regulations-to-expand-erisa-fiduciary-definition#sthash.kuXVj8CL.dpuf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">when there are specific suggestions</span></a> to engage or avoid certain investments. When investment communication is tailored to an individual, it is more likely to be considered a recommendation - particularly in exchange for fee or other forms of direct or indirect compensation.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">When investment advisers are not considered fiduciaries</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of these exclusions include employees of plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries, employee benefit plans, affiliates or employee organizations. This is true so long as these entities receive normal compensation for work performed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any programs that do not have an investment component, such as health and welfare plans, are also exempt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same applies for platforms of investment alternatives. These are exempt so long as advisers present these platforms to plan fiduciaries as impartial suggestions or explain that the advice is not intended as investment recommendations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Asset valuations are also exempt from the fiduciary definition under the new rules. However, the DOL has stated that it will seek to address asset valuation issues with further regulations.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The best interest contract exemption</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the regulations will be effective Apr. 10, 2017, advisers will have until Jan. 1, 2018 to ensure compliance with the "best interest contract exemption". This provision enables advisers to provide investment recommendations as long as they give "advice in the client's best interest, charge only reasonable compensation, and avoid misleading statements about fees and conflicts of interest."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exemption requires advisers to disclose all conflicts of interest and remove any financial incentives for investment advice that may not be in the client's best interest.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Congress recently revamped the rules by which the IRS </span><span class="s2">examines </span><span class="s1">partnerships for tax purposes with the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/97th-congress/house-bill/4961" target="_blank">repeal of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982</a>. TEFRA rules, otherwise known as unified audit and litigation procedures</span><span class="s2">. The TEFRA rules </span><span class="s1">were replaced under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/text" target="_blank">Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015</a></span><span class="s2">. The new rules</span><span class="s1"> to simplify the IRS's examination of partnerships</span><span class="s2">, assessment</span><span class="s1"> and the collection of taxes from them. </span><span class="s2">The essence of this change is that it will permit the IRS to collect more tax without increasing staff.  </span><span class="s1">These new tax rules will be applied to </span><span class="s2">certain </span><span class="s1">partnerships on Jan. 1, 2018.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The new Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 rules</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">
With the repeal of TEFRA rules, the IRS now requires entities to designate a powerful partnership representative rather than a tax matters partner. The rules also removed partners of notice and participation rights for partnership-level examination and litigation. In addition, IRS will switch to default collection procedures </span><span class="s2">from the partnership </span><span class="s1">for any additional taxes or penalties that exist at the partnership level. What this means for partners is that they should review the provisions of their partnership agreements and adjust their tax representation and procedures accordingly.</span></p>
A notable example of these changes under the new rules involves smaller partnerships. Specifically, any partnership with fewer than 100 partners can opt out of the tax examination and collection regime under the Bipartisan Budget Act. But to qualify for this opt-out clause, those partnerships need to consist either solely of individuals, C corporation, foreign entities that are treated as C-corps, S corporations or estates of deceased partners.

It is important to note though, while grantor trusts and limited liability companies with only one member are currently treated as individuals for tax purposes, the new rules deem them as a partnership. That means they are ineligible for the opt-out provision.<span class="s2">  This is an indirect attack on planning techniques that are not favored by this administration.</span>

These strict stipulations under the new rules are meant to simplify IRS tax treatment of partnerships by clearly defining them. But for those unaware of the new rules or the statutory opt-out provisions, the IRS is seeking comment for possible further regulations to resolve issues of interpretation.
<h2>Why the IRS seeks comment</h2>
The intentions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 rules have been well known for some time, but the bill was quickly drafted. Congress also followed this bill with the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 to address technical issues and ambiguities. So there were concerns over whether the IRS would fill in gaps in the legislation.

This is why the IRS then issued Notice 2016-23 to seek comments about the new tax collection regime under the bill. As the potential tax ramifications are significant for partnerships and limited liability companies, the IRS seeks comment on several specific stipulations. The most notable listed on the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/irb/2016-13_IRB/ar11.html" target="_blank"><span class="s3">IRS website include</span></a>:
<ul class="ul1">
 <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Partnership representatives.</span></li>
 <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Tax calculations at the partnership level.</span></li>
 <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Revised K-1 and push-out procedures.</span></li>
 <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Administrative adjustment requests at the partnership level.</span></li>
 <li class="li1"><span class="s1">General procedural rules.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The significance of the bill for existing partnerships</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">
The Bipartisan Budget Act's new tax audit and collection regime has understandably caused some concern among partnerships and limited liability companies. This is primarily due to the favorable state and federal income tax rules that existed for both partnership and limited liability companies. But as there are several new legal ramifications involved in the regime that could affect post-adjustment tax items, existing partnerships should <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/business-entity-formations/" target="_blank">examine their partnership agreements</a> to accommodate the new rules. In fact, one way these entities can proactively adjust is to modify their partnership agreements to align with the new rules prior to the deadline. This would retroactively adjust to the tax ramifications before the enactment date, thereby <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">avoiding any penalties or additional taxes</a>.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.businesslawnews.com/is-it-time-for-employers-to-start-preparing-for-new-overtime-rules/" target="_blank">As speculated on our BusinessLaw blog</a>, the U.S. Department of Labor recently made a major announcement to increase the minimum weekly wage level for salaried workers eligible for overtime pay. According to National Law Review, as of Dec. 1, companies across the U.S. will face <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/department-labor-issues-final-rule-regarding-overtime-exemption-white-collar" target="_blank"><span class="s2">significant changes in payroll</span></a>. In fact, the salary threshold will increase from $455 to $913 per week, which breaks out to nearly $47,500 per year - up from close to $24,000 annually.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how do companies adjust? There will likely be a jump in wage and hour lawsuits, which have been on the rise over the past decade. This increase could not only significantly increase the damages and attorney's fees for defense expenses, but these costs can also exceed the amount of wages in dispute. These extra expenses will come as the result of <a href="http://scarinciattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/FairLaborStandAct.pdf" target="_blank">claims available under the Fair Labor Standards Act</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With these increases in potential liabilities coupled with the increases in overtime pay, companies will need to adjust their compensation levels.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adjusting to the minimum weekly wage increase</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/dol-overtime-regulations-will-impact-employers/" target="_blank">Companies with workers that will be impacted by the new overtime pay rules</a> will need to figure out how to adjust their total compensation. This may include a number of different options, most notably increasing salary levels for those workers so that they reach exempt status.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many companies, this might not be a feasible option. These firms may decide to convert salary workers to hourly levels to be divided by the standard 40 hour work week. Another option is converting workers from salary to hourly, and then dividing this by the total hours worked in a week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another alternative would be to convert workers from salary to fluctuating workweeks. This would effectively enable a company to pay an employee for only hours worked. Some weeks would be less hours, while others would be more. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, an option that companies have is to offer non-discretionary bonuses or commission packages for workers. The new regulations allow these companies to pay up to 10 percent of the new minimum salary amount. This would effectively allow a company to have a worker under non-exempt status but compensate the employee for overtime pay under a commission structure for more work on fewer hours.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bottom line</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Employers need to determine the economic impact of the new rules on executive, administrative and professional-level employees within their organizations. There are alternatives for companies to convert their workers to exempt statuses or shift their compensation schedules for fear of incurring significant increases in overtime pay.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/UNICAP-rules.jpg" alt="UNICAP rules" width="400" height="400" />What You Need to Know About UNICAP Rules</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a small business designated as a C corporation, partnership, S corporation or limited liability company is not aware of uniform capitalization rules, they will need to read closely. The IRS has UNICAP rules that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Capitalization-Period-of-Direct-and-Indirect-Costs" target="_blank"><span class="s2">require partnerships to capitalize some costs</span></a> instead of deducting them as they are incurred during pre-production, pre-sale and actual production periods. These UNICAP rules apply to direct and indirect expenses incurred during these periods.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Business activity subject to UNICAP rules</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several actions in trade or business or activities conducted for profit that <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/cost-segregation-audit-technique-guide-chapter-6-1-uniform-capitalization" target="_blank">qualify for UNICAP rules</a>. These actions specifically involve the production of real or tangible personal property for use in the business or activity, production of real or tangible personal property for sale to customers or the acquisition of property for resale. With this last action, UNICAP rules do not apply to personal property with average annual gross receipts under $10 million.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that UNICAP rules are not applicable for items that are classified as inventory, which are considered non-incidental materials and supplies. In the event that UNICAP rules do not apply to a business, both its direct and a portion of indirect costs need to be capitalized. That will raise the basis of the produced property or the inventory costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this way, UNICAP rules are a temporary difference in those costs. What this means is that these costs incurred and capitalized during the pre-production, pre-sale and actual production periods are delayed until a later accounting date, instead of being disallowed. Furthermore, these capitalized costs to produced property used in business or trade actions will be expensed in the future as either amortization or depreciation. In turn, the capitalized costs for produced property to be sold to customers, or acquired property for resale purposes, will be expensed in the future as the costs of goods sold - in the event that the property is sold.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct vs. indirect costs for accounting purposes</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The capitalized direct costs are classified as material and labor expenses that are involved in the costs to produce the asset.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the portion of the capitalized indirect costs that were incurred during the production or resale process, there are several accounting methods involved in expensing these amounts.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Difficulties presented by UNICAP rules</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is challenging for businesses to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">determine the costs properly allocated to produced property</a>. These rules for capitalization of interests as allocable costs are complex. That is largely due to the fact that the rules have potentially significant ramifications on deductible interest cost amounts, as opposed to interest costs that need to be capitalized.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the issues with the new overtime pay rules regarding wage and hour regulations is companies are unaware of the major changes of the proposal, which is set to go into effect Dec. 1.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Department of Labor, a prime example of the changes for salaried employees is for personnel who earn under <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/final2016/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$47,476 annually</span></a>. These employees are set to earn a substantial raise for overtime pay from $455 to $913 per week. That will equate to a spike in salary $23,660 to $47,476 per year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Specifically, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/dol-overtime-regulations-will-impact-employers/" target="_blank">the regulations will target the salaries</a> of "executive, administrative, professional and computer employees." The DOL also said "unless covered by an exemption, employees covered by the <a href="http://hr.ofm.wa.gov/compensation-job-classes/compensation-administration/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa" target="_blank">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> must receive overtime pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular rate of pay."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has been difficult for companies to determine what is coming under the FLSA. The regulations are confusing, but listed below are some clarifications on what many companies need to consider in terms of overtime eligibility and employee exemptions.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The most common employees affected by new overtime pay rules</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is where it gets tricky. The employees most impacted by the new rules will typically be women as well as college-educated people between ages 25 and 34. That will affect roughly 4.2 million workers. Of those employees, 55.6 percent will be women, and 39.2 percent will have a Bachelor's degree, according to Oregon Live. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Exempt from exemptions?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can be confusing because there will be certain employees in situations where they will be exempt from the exemption even if they seemingly qualify as nonexempt under the new rules. A prime example of these types of employees that are exceptions to the exemptions include teachers, doctors and lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To know how these rules specifically impact a company, a firm will first need to know how the business should be classified. This is part of what the rule is designed to correct because many companies have previously misclassified their employees, which resulted in lower or higher overtimes wages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new overtime rules target job titles, but classification is for job duties. So regardless of the job title, <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/labor-employment/" target="_blank">an employee may be exempt by duties</a>, however, his role may change what they are.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/new-overtime-wage-and-hours-regulations.jpg" alt="new overtime wage and hours regulations" />What small businesses should do about the DOL's wage and hour regulations</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the surface, the intent of the <a href="/new-overtime-pay-rules/">Department of Labor's new overtime wage and hours regulations</a> was to establish rules that make it easier for businesses to apply to their operations. However, according to Business News Daily, for small businesses, the proposal serves as a major shift in <a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9110-federal-overtime-rules.html" target="_blank"><span class="s2">hiring practices, payroll and corporate structure</span></a>. This is particularly true for smaller </span><span class="s3">firms practicing </span><span class="s1">account</span><span class="s3">ing,</span><span class="s1"> law </span><span class="s3">and</span><span class="s1"> consult</span><span class="s3">ing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">A pall is cast over</span><span class="s1"> small businesses of any kind because there is no telling how these regulations will impact them in the long term. In fact, the troubling aspect of these regulations for many small-business owners is that it signals more changes on the way because the Department of Labor intends to raise the wage minimum threshold for overtime pay for non-exempt employees every three years starting Jan. 1, 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All told, when these regulations take effect on Dec. 1 of this year, more than 4.2 million workers will be affected, according to the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/" target="_blank">Society for Human Resource Management</a>. These employees, who had been exempt from overtime pay or reduced pay, will now be entitled to receive new salary level minimums. The key issue is that in order for these employees to be considered nonexempt, their weekly earnings will need to be bumped up to comply with the new regulatory standards.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">New rules will force small businesses to evaluate their workforces</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">
The regulations will force many companies to make tough decisions regarding non-exempt employees. Small businesses will need to determine whether non-exempt employees are worth the bump in pay to make them exempt or if they will need to hire part-time or temporary workers to avoid paying the stiffer overtime wages. That is a major shift because the pay increase jumps from $455 per week in standard salaries for overtime pay to $913 weekly, and the highly-compensated employee threshold spikes from $100,000 to $134,004 annually.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these concerns can be avoided by simply not having employees work beyond the standard 40-hour work week. That will be especially important for employees making under $47,000 per year because of the spike in their overtime wages. The question is whether the rues will force smaller businesses to determine whether to have employees work fewer hours, implement bonus or commission structures to enhance productivity of employees within the 40-hour work week or just increase wages to make employees exempt. While there are certainly options for small businesses in terms of maneuvering employees around the exemption thresholds, the options will have a significant impact on their payrolls.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The impact will be expensive</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">
On top of the potential salary increases, there will be several new considerations for small businesses in terms of employee hour controls. For instance, timekeeping systems may need to become an added expense to ensure nonexempt employees remain within the hourly threshold. Training and resource allocation will also need to be heavily monitored to ensure employees are within the exemption standards. Furthermore, smaller businesses may also need to hire part-time staff to accommodate the productivity gaps from nonexempt employees. Workload overflow is a reality for many small businesses, so it may very well be more cost effective to cap an employee's workweek at 40 hours and hire additional staff.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bottom line</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">
The most substantial change in the new regulations is that it impacts salaried employees. Previously, small businesses were afforded flexibility with employee hours per week due to salary instead of hourly wages, but now those advantages are gone. For example, if an employee works additional hours to advance his career, it may actually impede his progress due to the overtime pay exemption thresholds.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 3rd Circuit recently overturned an IRS decision with the assertion that Giant Eagle, a supermarket chain, was entitled to make a $3.7 million deduction on the expenses associated with loyalty discounts from its tax returns. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report, in its decision, the Court ruled that the <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/tax-services/publications/insights/assets/pwc-third-circuit-addresses-when-certain-liabilities-become-fixed.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">IRS was incorrect in denying the deduction</span></a> because the </span><span class="s3">two prongs of the </span><span class="s1">"all events test" were fulfilled.</span><span class="s3"> The first prong of the “all events test” is whether the liability is fixed.  The second prong of the test is whether the amounts can be determined with reasonable accuracy.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The case background</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Giant Eagle Inc. v. Commissioner, the supermarket chain offered a "fuelperks!" program with loyalty discounts awarded for gas that expired after three months if unused. </span><span class="s3">The discounts were earned by purchases and the first prong of  the “all events test’ was easily determined. </span><span class="s1">However, the IRS took exception to when Giant Eagle deducted the estimated expenses in 2006 and 2007 from customers redeeming a portion of the loyalty gas points - many of which were either unused or not expired.</span><span class="s3"> It is here that IRS claimed that the determination of the amount could not be made with reasonable accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS denied the deductions, which prompted the company to appeal the decision to the U.S. Tax Court. The Tax Court subsequently upheld the IRS decision, whereupon Giant Eagle filed an appeal to the 3rd Circuit Court of appeals.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The 3rd Circuit reverses the IRS decision</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court asserted that the all events test was applicable to the case. In its ruling, the Court stated that since a liability can accrue within a tax year where all events occurred, liability had been established</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stated liabilities became fixed only when the discounts were used. Since the total amount of Giant Eagle's expected liability could be conclusively determined by the end of the tax year, the all events test provisions were fulfilled. According to Judge Jane R. Roth's opinion cited by Law 360, Giant Eagle entered a unilateral contract in its loyalty program for customers, so its liabilities were <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/793674/3rd-circ-sides-with-giant-eagle-in-irs-fuel-perks-tax-row"><span class="s2">sufficiently fixed to be tax deductible</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Giant Eagle amply demonstrated the existence — as of year's end — of both an absolute liability and a near-certainty that the liability would soon be discharged by payment," Roth explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court also reasoned that Regulation 1.451-4(a)(1) enables taxpayers to use an accrual method of accounting to deduct costs before they occur if the all events test has occurred in the tax year and liability was established and could be reasonably identified.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Significance of the ruling</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Court's decision to appeal the previous decisions was important because it seemed to disagree with established legal precedents and published regulations. With the significance of the decision, it will be interesting to see the impact it will have on tax deductible liabilities regulations in the future</span><span class="s3"> or whether the IRS will seek a legislative remedy.</span></p>]]></content>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/text" target="_blank">Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015</a> (“BBA”)</span><span class="s2">, which will take effect in 2018, the IRS will be able to audit</span><span class="s1"> certain </span><span class="s2">partnerships and </span><span class="s1">limited liability companies (</span><span class="s2">LLCs</span><span class="s1">)</span> <span class="s1">and collect the tax resulting from the adjustment at the partnership level.</span><span class="s2"> This makes for new partnership audit rules that were originally enacted in 1982 under TEFRA. According to a Crains Cleveland report, this </span><span class="s1">change </span><span class="s2">is significant because it allows the </span><span class="s1">IRS </span><span class="s2">to <a href="http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20160709/BLOGS05/160709840/tax-tips-new-rules-affect-tax-partnerships" target="_blank"><span class="s3">collect tax revenue</span></a> directly from partnerships. Currently, </span><span class="s1">TEFRA </span><span class="s2">only enable</span><span class="s1">s</span><span class="s2"> the IRS to collect any taxes owed from individual partners in a partnership.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The genesis of this change is the number of tiered partnerships and large partnerships make it difficult and time consuming for the IRS to flow through changes to many individual partners and multi-tiered partnerships.  IRS believes it can raise billions in revenue by eliminating the need to adjust each partner’s personal return or to push the adjustment through to each one of several tiered partnerships.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">What partners should consider</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Below are key considerations for partners now:</span></p>

<ul>
 <li class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">Partnership representative</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">This is a role designated by one of the members of a partnership. </span><span class="s1">Under</span><span class="s2"> TEFRA</span><span class="s1">, a partnership would designate a <a href="http://us.practicallaw.com/5-382-3870" target="_blank">Tax Matters Partner to coordinate tax </a></span><span class="s2"><a href="http://us.practicallaw.com/5-382-3870" target="_blank">audits</a>. The role itself has limited authority over a partnership under current </span><span class="s1">TEFRA </span><span class="s2">rules. But Bloomberg BNA noted that under the new law</span><span class="s1"> (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) that</span><span class="s2"> this role will be shifted over to the <a href="http://www.bna.com/implications-tefra-repeal-n57982069032/" target="_blank"><span class="s3">partnership representative</span></a>, who will have authority over the partnership </span><span class="s1">tax audits and the authority to bind </span><span class="s2">the </span><span class="s1">partnership and its partners</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
This role will allow the partnership representative to make final decisions on audits and other tax proceedings such as whether to pursue litigation. The significant aspect of the partnership representative though is that he or she does not need to be an existing member of the partnership. In fact, if not selected by the members of the partnership, the IRS can appoint one. This is a change worth noting because the partnership representative will have ultimate authority, even if <span class="s1">the authority is </span><span class="s2">not </span><span class="s1">granted </span><span class="s2">in the </span><span class="s1">partnership or </span><span class="s2">operating agreement.</span><span class="s1">  Perhaps the most significant issue is the ability to make a push-out election whereby the partnership shifts the adjustment to the partners in the year under audit.</span>
<ul>
 <li class="p1"><strong>Conflict of interest</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Since it is possible that a partnership representative would have a conflict of interest in acting on behalf of the partnership, consideration should also be given to imposing some level of fiduciary duty on the partnership representative or at least allow the possible replacement of the partnership representative if it appears that there is a conflict of interest.</span><span class="s1"> Other provisions might include the duty to inform, to allow participation in the audit and to require certain elections to be subject to vote.</span></p>

<ul>
 <li class="p2"><strong>Tax adjustment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It is important to note that the tax on the partnership audit adjustment is no longer the sum of the individual deficiencies of the partners; instead, it is the adjustment multiplied by the highest marginal tax rate (Applicable Highest Tax Rate) for the tax year under audit (“Reviewed Year”).  The year in which payment of the tax adjustment is made is called the Adjustment Year and is the direct responsibility of the partnership and indirectly of the current partners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Now, partnership agreements will have to address potential future tax adjustments through the use of indemnification provisions or escrows. Certainly, purchase and sale agreements will face this issue. </span></p>

<ul>
 <li class="p3"><strong><span class="s4">Opting out</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A partnership may opt out of the new rules if the partnership issues 100 or less K-1s and if all the partners are individuals, C corporations, S corporations, a deceased partner’s estate or a foreign entity taxed as a C corporation. A partnership will not be able to elect out if a trust or a partnership is a partner.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">The significance of the new rules</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">With the significance of the changes in how partnerships are taxed, as well as the replacement of the tax matters partner with the partnership representative, these entities should review their current </span><span class="s1">partnership or </span><span class="s2">operating agreements now to adjust. This is particularly important because it may cause partnerships to dissolve entirely, or significantly change the operating agreements to restrict the authority of a partnership representative as much as possible.</span></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/partners-as-employees.jpg" alt="partners as employees" />New regulations change how partnerships treat partners as employees</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury recently issued regulations to address the way the former taxes partners in a partnership that has a sole owner of a non-corporate entity. Specifically, the regulations apply to partners employed by the partnership. According to a National Law Review report, in the regulation, partners in these situations are <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-irs-regulations-subject-certain-partners-to-self-employment-taxes" target="_blank"><span class="s2">not treated as employees</span></a> for employment tax and benefit plan purposes. The partners are treated as self-employed individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result of the regulation, partnerships will need to examine their structures and the manner in which they classify their partners and employees within their company structures.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes in the new rules</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These non-corporate entities will continue to not be subject to federal income taxes, but they will be treated as corporations for employment tax purposes. Furthermore, these entities are not treated as corporations for self-employment tax reasons either. As a result, each partner in the entity partnership will be subject to self-employment taxes on net earnings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With partners considered as self-employed in the partnership, they will also be unable to participate in Section 125, which offers a favorable tax benefit plan. This is significant because these partners will not be able to deduct employer-provided accident and health plans from gross income.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Impact on non-corporate entities owned by partnerships</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aside for the <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/801477/irs-puts-an-end-to-treating-partners-as-employees" target="_blank"><span class="s2">self-employment taxes</span></a>, partners that were previously regarded as employees need to be aware of compensation reporting, health and compensation benefits plans and state tax implications, according to Law 360.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The self-employment taxes calls for a partner to deduct the employer-equivalent portion of the self-employment tax when calculating his adjusted gross income.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compensation reporting will also change because partners will not longer be able to file W-2 employment tax forms. They will not need to file this information on Schedule K-1 tax forms submitted by the non-corporate partnership entity.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Benefit &amp; retirement plans</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Health benefits plans are now treated as income tax earned by the partners, as self-employed individuals in a partnership can deduce the cost of health insurance from their net earnings.</span></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/New-Tax-Status-Regulations.jpg" alt="New Tax Status Regulations" />Recently, the IRS proposed new tax status regulations related to the Section 457(f) <a href="http://src.bna.com/f5j" target="_blank"><span class="s2">non-qualified deferred compensation plans</span></a> offered by tax exempt employers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Proposed regulations</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of the proposal was to clearly define which deferred and actual amounts the IRS will tax as income following the lapse of the risk of forfeiture. A Spencer Fane LLP report found a portion of the proposed rules are <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=86222e77-1092-4d2c-9a5f-4dca9fd191b9" target="_blank"><span class="s2">similar to the existing language under 409A</span></a>, but some differences between the overlap of Sections 457(f) and 409A will be explained. Most notably, the substantial risk of forfeiture terms, which are different in 457(f) and 409A, are unified in the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the IRS' public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Oct. 18, the expectation is that the regulations will not be finalized until sometime in 2017, which would most likely mean the implementation date will be 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Substantial risk of forfeiture language has changed</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While deferrals of compensation remain the same in the proposal, the language under the substantial risk of forfeiture is changed. Specifically, Spencer Fane LLP research found a 457(f) non-qualified deferred compensation plan participant will need to be aware that his entitlement to the deferred amount is contingent on three new options.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first of these newly defined amounts are contingent on substantial future service performances. Another option participants have is if the possibility of forfeiting the plan is a substantial hit, they will be allowed to keep the compensation in the plan. A final alternative is participants can reach an agreement to not compete with their employers, which enables participants to maintain the tax advantages of the deferred amounts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On one hand, this noncompete clause is an agreement between the employer and the plan participant for the employee not to join a competing organization. But the employee can also reach a noncompete agreement with an employer if he has bona fide interest in keeping the tax-advantaged status of his plan while engaging in activities with a competitor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Overall, the clarification in this language was designed to outline the types of elective deferrals that may be treated as substantial risk of forfeiture. Specifically, the definition of a substantial risk of forfeiture is any amount that exceeds 25 percent more than the amount the employee would lose if he had not elected to defer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Other notable changes</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among the major changes is that short-term deferrals and bona fide severance pay plans will now be tax exempt. This is significant because while the language is similar for the two terms between 457(f) and 409A, they are not identical.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deferred amounts will also keep their tax exempt statuses for involuntary employment termination. Previously, there were slight differences in the language between the two tax codes for voluntary and involuntary terminations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The regulations will need more clarification</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS intended for the proposal to clarify the terms of incentive compensation plans, employment agreements and bonus arrangements that employers reach with employees. As compensation deferrals for tax purposes is such an important issue, clearer definitions of activities that could potentially risk forfeiture are needed. This is particularly true for language differences that still exist between 457(f) and 409A. Until the proposal is finalized, though, employers and employees have the ability to begin to adjust to the new regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the meantime, employers will have the ability to submit comments and questions to the IRS on the new proposal until Sept. 20.</span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Changes to lease accounting rules impact business financial statements and due diligence inquiries in sales and dispositions of businesses. The traditional financial statement would have finance leases and capital leases that users of financial statements would be able to interpret having some familiarity with the established concepts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is now considered a lease?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/changes-to-lease-accounting-rules.jpg" alt="changes to lease accounting rules" />Now, under the new rules from FASB and IASB, a lease is the right to control and use an asset for a period of time in exchange for payment(s) and this creates an asset and a liability that lessees must put on their balance sheets. The new rule recites that a lease exists if there is control such that one has the right to operate, control physical access or take all of the output from the asset. Now, due diligence activity must <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">review contracts to determine if a lease is present</a>. The right to substitute defeats the right to control a particular asset that is essential for a lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new rule will probably force many capital leases to be classified as finance leases, where the right to use will be amortized by the lessee who must also recognize an interest component. Most operating leases will probably remain classified as such.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Changes the new rules bring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One change is that sale and leaseback transactions must conform to the revenue recognition model under <a href="http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176168066253" target="_blank">ASC 606 </a><em>Contracts With Customers. </em>This will change how sales are recognized in a sales and leasebacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Leases with bundled services must be divided into interest expense and lease expense. Variable rate payments must be measured at the start of a lease. Variable use payments are recognized as incurred by the lessee and as earned by the lessor.Under FASB, lessors will recognize profit at the start of the lease when it is essentially a sale and over the term of the lease if the lessee does not obtain control. Leveraged leases accounting is eliminated. Lessors will recognize income at the start of the lease under IASB rules in either instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The new rules come into effect for private clients in the years after 2019, although early adoption is permitted.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Problems with the changes to lease accounting rules</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are a few problems that one can expect. First, older accounting software may not adapt to the new rules and this raises questions about financial statements and their evaluation. A bridge or conversion statement may be necessary to evaluate historical information under the new rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Compensation benchmarks, loan covenants and other metrics can be impacted by the new accounting rules. How does someone performing due diligence evaluate the credit worthiness or earnings capacity under the change without modeling the target? Lenders will be impacted by these rules and may want to re-negotiate covenants for this reason. Finally, executive compensation will undoubtedly be the subject of careful analysis.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[The <a href="/new-partnership-audit-rules">new partnership audit rules</a> enacted as part of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/text" target="_blank"><em>The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015</em></a> (the “Rules”) are designed to collect more income tax. The Internal Revenue Service (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank">IRS</a>) does not have the manpower to chase every taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership with an audit adjustment. The Rules are designed to collect from the partnership tax the IRS previously sought from the partners.

<strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Partnership-Audit-Rules.jpg" alt="partnership audit rules" />Before "the Rules" were put into effect</strong>

Under the audit rules of TEFRA, enacted in 1982, the IRS was authorized to perform one audit at the partnership level rather than multiple audits of the same issues at the partner level. The IRS was required, however, to collect tax at the partner level. This proved difficult because, for example, while one partner may be able to prove material participation, another may not. Regardless, each partner had to be assessed separately. Multiply the number of taxpayer-partners, individual circumstances, the various rules and limitations under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26" target="_blank">Internal Revenue Code</a> and one can imagine the enormity of the IRS’s problem.

<strong>When do "the Rules" go into effect?</strong>

The Rules are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 unless the partnership elects to have the new rules apply. (This would be a brave step without regulations in place.) A partner, from a year under audit (now called a “Reviewed Year”), who is no longer a partner in the year the audit is concluded and the final partnership adjustment (FPA) is issued, may be able to shift his tax liability to those who are partners in the year the FPA is issued. This possibility raises new issues for due diligence, indemnification provision, partnership agreements and buy-sell matters.

<strong>What about the TMP?</strong>

TEFRA designated a Tax Matters Partner (<a href="http://us.practicallaw.com/5-382-3870" target="_blank">TMP</a>) who represented a partnership before IRS in any audit. The Rules create the position of Taxpayer Representative who is now the only person who may represent the partnership before the IRS and need not be a partner. In fact, partners have no right to participate under the Rules so partnership agreements must be re-written to require notices of audit be given to partners and their consent obtained for settlement. One can easily imagine how an audit settlement may favor to one partner but not to the circumstances of another partner. No doubt there will be litigation in the future against the Taxpayer Representative alleging breach of fiduciary duty and abuse of discretion.

<strong>Opt out of new rules</strong>

Partnerships with 100 or fewer partners may elect out of the new rules. The ability to elect out is only available if each partner is an individual, a C corporation, S corporation, an estate of a deceased partner or a foreign entity that would be treated as a U.S. corporation. Thus, partnerships having a partner that is a trust or a tiered partnerships may not elect out.

<strong>Foreign partners</strong>

Foreign partners that are equivalent to C corporations pose an interesting problem. Assuming an election out is made, the distributing-partnership must somehow adjust for withholding burden imposed on effectively connected income or income from the sale of real estate. Cash used to pay tax may be treated as a loan or a distribution, but it must be accounted for in some manner.

<strong>Payment of tax alternatives</strong>

The Rules have three alternatives for the payment of tax. First, the partnership will pay the tax in the year the FPA is issued, which is also referred to as the year of adjustment. Tax will be imposed at the highest rate on the underpayment; however, the partnership may demonstrate that a lower rate applies. The second alternative is to “push-out” the adjustment to those partners who were partners at the time the return was filed. These partners pay the tax in the current year rather than amending old returns. The price for this option is that interest at 5% over the short term AFR is charged with penalty from the year when the original return was due. The third method is where any partner from the Reviewed Year pays his or her share of the tax and files an amended return. The partnership bill is reduced accordingly.

		<content><![CDATA[If you are a small business owner and receive income from your business for services, you will need to eventually pay employment tax as well as individual income tax on that money. As this is commonly misunderstood at tax time, many small business owners and sole proprietors end up with sizable IRS bills come tax time.

<strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Employment-Tax.jpg" alt="employment tax" />The confusion around the tax implications</strong>

Part of the confusion is that many individuals are more familiar with being an employee of a corporation that is considered to be the employer. An employer bears one-half of the employment tax cost and the employee bears the other half. Since the employee’s one-half is withheld from wages, the employee may not appreciate that the tax burden for one-half of employment tax falls upon the employee.

Small business owners often think because they pay themselves through their companies for their services, this income escapes self-employment tax. However, the opposite is true. This applies to all types of business structures for tax purposes, just to varying degrees. These business types are in place to determine the amount of tax liability in which the business is responsible.

<strong>Business structure and personal income tax responsibilities</strong>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Sole proprietorship</strong></li>
</ul>
In this instance, there is often confusion over how this income is taxed. Any money made from the company is not paid on a separate federal business income tax return. The income and deductions for this type of business structure are reported on a Schedule C filed as part of the individual’s Form 1040. A limited liability company having an individual as its sole member reports on Schedule C, unless the business activity is the passive rental of real estate reported which is reported on Schedule E.
<ul>
 <li><strong>Partnerships</strong></li>
</ul>
This is a broad term that includes general partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships filing Form 1065 for partnership income. Form 1065 includes Form K-1 for each partner, which sets forth the partner’s share of each item. Every item of income or deduction that is subject to a limitation at the partner level is reported separately so the partner may properly prepare his or her own tax return. The partnership structure is particularly tricky for small business owners.

While a partnership does not pay business income taxes on the earnings of the partnership, it does need to report all gross earnings and expenses from partnership activity. The partners of the partnership or members of the company use Form k-1 to report their share of the various totals. Many small business owners know that the partnership is an employer of those non-owners who perform services for the partnership. What is not evident is that a partner is not an employee of the partnership but is considered self-employed and must pay self-employment income on the share of income received for services. The IRS position on this is clear. Omitted from this commentary are limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships which have nuances on issues other than self-employment taxes, and coverage of guaranteed payments.
<ul>
 <li><strong>Limited liability companies</strong></li>
</ul>
LLCs may be taxed as partnerships, S corporations or regular C corporations. When taxed as a C corporation or S corporation, the corporation is the employer, the small business owner is an employee and the discussion in the first paragraph applies. LLCs taxed as partnerships are treated as described in the preceding paragraph. LLCs must elect to be taxed as a C corporation or S corporation.
<ul>
 <li><strong>C corporation or S corporation</strong></li>
</ul>
These corporations pay one-half of the self-employment tax, unlike the LLC taxed as a partnership. Some persons prefer S corporations to an LLC because the corporation pays one-half of the self-employment tax. The preference for C or S status has less to do with employment taxes than it has to do with two levels of taxation, the ability to raise capital from the public and the limitations imposed on benefit and compensation plans. Ownership of S corporation is restricted and inflexible when compared to that of a C corporation or LLC

		<content><![CDATA[<h2><strong><img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/will-execution.jpg" alt="proper will excecution" /></strong>Where state law matters in proper will execution</h2>
We expect that as time passes, people become more sophisticated and aware of what must be done to execute a valid will. Unfortunately, this is not so.

In certain states, execution of a will is complete when it is signed by a second witness. Some states require the witnesses to <a href="http://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">sign in the presence of the testator</a> while others permit the witnesses to sign within a reasonable time thereafter. A Washington case saw the testator execute a valid will in that state in 1988 (the “1988 Will”). Then, in 2012, the testator executed another will in Arizona (the “2012 Will”) in the presence of a notary who also signed as a witness. The testator died in the State of Washington and probate was sought there. One of the testator’s friends, who present at the execution of the 2012 Will in Arizona, traveled to Washington where he added his signature as a witness. Arizona does not require the witnesses to sign in the presence of the testator, only within a reasonable time thereafter.

<strong>Which will was admitted to probate?</strong>

The State of Washington admitted the 1988 Will. Although Arizona does not require the witnesses to sign in the presence of the testator, the court held that the 2012 Will was executed in the State of Washington when the second witness signed and the act was finally completed. The rule in Washington requires that the two witnesses to sign in the presence of the testator so the 2012 Will was invalid by Washington law. The court held further that an Arizona will could only be valid as a foreign will if it was valid or complied with the law of the state where executed. The outcome may have been different had the second witness signed in Arizona, when the testator signed, within a reasonable time thereafter or, perhaps, if the 2012 Will was brought back into Arizona. This case also addressed whether the testator ever gave up his Washington domicile and was a contributing factor to the weight given to law of the place of execution. (<a href="https://casetext.com/case/atkinson-v-estate-of-hook-in-re-estate-of-hook" target="_blank">In re Estate of Hook</a>).

A California case poses an interesting twist where a testator and two witnesses appeared before a notary and subscribed the will. The will was challenged and the notary admitted in a deposition that he had forged the signature of one witness. The trial court admitted the will and the appellate court affirmed holding that the jurat indicated that the notary was present at the time the testator signed and, therefore, could be counted as the second witness. A jurat is found at the very end of an affidavit. A jurat states when, where and before whom the affidavit was sworn. (<a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/montana/supreme-court/2015/da-14-0605.html" target="_blank">In re Estate of Harris</a>).

<strong>The bottom line</strong>

If people wonder why attorneys prefer that clients come to their offices to execute documents, especially wills, these two cases should enlighten them. This is especially true where you may not know if local law was complied with at execution. One of my clients, a consultant, would say: “If you do not have time to do it right, how will you ever find time to do it over?” Imagine the savings in time and money had a second witness signed before the testator and the notary.

The financial crisis and subsequent world-wide events breathed new life into the scrutiny of governmental financial information reports. The renewed interest is, in part, due to an appreciation of risk and a lingering distrust as the result of being burned.

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/financial-information.jpg" alt="financial information" />

One national government’s financial information report consolidates over 150 operating entities within the financial report; however, it excludes those entities which are autonomous. In fact, one of its autonomous agencies has a balance sheet that is one-quarter of the size of the national government but it is not consolidated.

On an accrual basis, the national government’s liabilities are five (5) to six (6) times greater than the assets leaving the government deeply in the hole. Care to guess?

<strong>The answer</strong>

If you guessed the country was Greece, you are wrong. Although Greece did not report defense expenditures as part of its budget shortfall and thus hid the magnitude of its deficits pre-crisis, it is not Greece. One can recall the unrest in the financial markets and in the European Union as the Greek Debt crisis played out. The media and European leaders characterized the Greek government and its financial management as irresponsible and deceptive. How would one characterize the government and its financial affairs based on what is set forth above?

The culprit is the United States. The 2015 Financial Report of the United States Government is prepared by Treasury and OMB and is audited by the GAO. The United States has a negative position (assets less liabilities) of $18.2 trillion dollars. $13.2 trillion of the liabilities are debt and interest on obligations held by third parties. Three areas account for 66% of operating expenditures and they are Defense (15%), Social Security (24%) and Health and Human Services (27%). The cash based operating budget deficit is $439 billion and it increases to $520 billion on an accrual basis to anticipate post-retirement benefit programs and changes in asset valuations. The bright spot is that the past five years show a narrowing of the deficit as revenue increases and costs are reduced.

<strong>The Federal Reserve Bank</strong>

The agency whose financial information is not consolidated is that of the Federal Reserve Bank. It is because of its independent Board of Governors that it is not consolidated, a result that I concede is correct. Although nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Board of Governors does exercise independent discretion. The debt of the US government that it holds is, however, massive and history has no precedent for the unwinding of these obligations through retirement or refinancing.

Our debt to GDOP ratio is unsustainable; however, the debates and election rhetoric bypass the stark reality of these figures and the downward trajectory of our glide path.

The 2015 report is 267 pages; however, there is a condensed eight page document called the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/finrep/fr/15frusg/CitizensGuide2015.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Citizen’s Guide</em> which is available to the public</a> for those who are interested.]]></content>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/revoke-your-passport.jpg" alt="revoke your passport" />

According to a recently <span class="s2">enacted statute</span><span class="s1">, the State Department can revoke the passport of an individual with certified delinquent tax debt. According to a LexisNexis Legal Newsroom report, under IRC section 7345, the IRS has the right to report any individuals with certified delinquent tax debt to the State Department, which then has the right to not only <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/tax-law/b/emerging-issues/archive/2016/06/29/new-law-allowing-irs-to-seize-passport.aspx" target="_blank"><span class="s3">revoke the passports of taxpayers</span></a>, but also deny issuance or place limitations on passports.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What defines delinquent federal tax debt?</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This type of serious tax debt that is certified as delinquent is any unpaid liability. However, it does not include two specific circumstances. If an individual pays their taxes as part of an installment agreement or a compromise arrangement, and/or had a suspension of their collection actions have been suspended as the result of pending due process hearings, is not deemed as delinquent status.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The details of the rule</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the law, certification for delinquent tax debt involves any liability that the IRS deems unpaid. Its qualifications require that the federal tax debt was assessed at a value more than $50,000 - including interest and penalties - and if a lien has been filed by the IRS. For this final requirement, the lien must have been filed under section 6323 and that the taxpayer rights under section 6320 have been exhausted, or that a levy was made under section 6331. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What happens in the case of decertification?</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the event the IRS de-certifies a delinquent federal tax debt due to processing errors, the liability is satisfied, a taxpayer requests a claim for innocent spouse relief, or the debt is no long considered delinquent due to inflation adjustments, the IRS must alert the State Department. In turn, the notification needs to be made prior to the release of any debt liens issued. The IRS also needs to notify the State Department within 30 days of a taxpayer requesting or electing for innocent spouse relief, and inside 30 days of an installment or compromise agreement is reached with the IRS. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the case of erroneous certification though, the IRS will need to alert the State department as soon as the inaccuracies are discovered. If and when a tax debt is de-certified due to error, the IRS must notify both the taxpayer and the State Department. In that notice, the taxpayer must also be informed that he or she has the right to file a civil action against the IRS in district or tax court. The court can then decide whether the certification was approved because of the error, and if so, order the Treasury Department to alert the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The law represents a trend</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IRS is just the latest government agency to have the authority to take more drastic actions due to delinquent tax debt. There was a landmark legislation passed in 2013 to enable the state of New York to suspend drivers licenses for delinquent taxes of more than $10,000. The way this law works is that individuals have within 60 days to respond to a notice of tax delinquency, and 15 more days after receiving a second notification. At which point, if the individual fails to respond, the state can suspend the taxpayer's license until the full back tax amount if paid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is just one recent law similar to <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:26%20section:7345%20edition:prelim)" target="_blank">IRC section 7345</a>, but it remains to be seen how far the IRS will lobby to take special measures to collect taxes. </span></p>

<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-tax-strategy.jpg" alt="trump tax strategy" />

Critics and supporters have been outspoken about Republican president-elect Donald Trump's tax returns recently. According to a Politico report, the focus of the debate has been over the legality of <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-taxes-surrogates-229018" target="_blank">Trump's tax-minimizing strategies since 1995</a>.</span>

<span class="s1"><b>Trump's tax-minimization strategy draws criticism</b></span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a recent story published in the New York Times, selected sections of Trump's tax returns in 1995 showed he registered a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><span class="s2">$916 million loss that year</span></a>. As a result, this would enable him to avoid any payment of personal income taxes on his returns for up to 18 years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Critics of the strategy have been vocal because many see this as a potential deciding factor for independent voters. Politico reported that while supporters approved of the strategy, detractors point to the massive loss as proof that either Trump's business ventures have not been as successful as he reported, or that he has hidden assets and did not pay an adequate share of individual income taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, critics have been outspoken about the fact that by Trump not publicly releasing his financial records, he is withholding the identity of debtors and creditors who could have influence over his campaign. This could leave the door open to special interest groups guiding some of Trump's policies as president. Ultimately, this could tarnish his position as a self-made business success to his voter base.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Supporters approve of the Trump tax strategy</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those in favor of Trump's tax avoidance strategy point to his prowess as a businessman. They also assert that the manner in which he has minimized his individual tax return is well within the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">legal application of the IRS tax codes</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Supporters have additionally been on record to state that his individual tax returns should be withheld because he is not a public official. In fact, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani argued recently that not releasing these records is part of a fiduciary obligation:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"You are ignoring completely the fiduciary obligation that he has to all the people around him to run his business at the lowest possible expense," Giuliani explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether Trump's strategy is part of a fiduciary duty to his shareholders is still up for debate. However, it remains to be seen if him taking the loss on his individual income tax returns is part of this fiduciary obligation. The impact of this revelation could be significant come election day for those both in favor and against the tax minimization strategy.</span></p>

When tax season comes around, there are several factors to keep in mind as a small business owner in New Jersey; specifically with income tax returns.

<a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">Tracking taxable income and ensuring compliance with requisite tax forms</a> can be an ongoing struggle with the pressures of running a business. On top of everything else, a small business owner also needs to make sure that he files his appropriate personal income tax on the earnings they paid themselves from their company versus the business tax return from company income earned.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Income tax filings</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is difficult enough to <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">properly file income taxes</a>, but with all the capital expenses a small business owner makes, a sizable tax bill can be even more challenging without seeking loans. Without enough money to pay for taxes on profits, this is a particularly pressing issue for small business owners who have spent their remaining funds on capital expenditures for the year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the issue for companies of this size is the amount of effort to collect sales taxes from customers. In each state that a New Jersey small business conducts sales, the owner is required to collect the sales tax as applicable to the state. These taxes cannot be written off on returns because sales taxes are considered personal liabilities to the owner of the business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A common misconception of collecting sales tax is that the revenue earned from those sales do not belong to the company. These earnings need calculation and paid to the federal and state governments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Structure the business properly</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Small business owners in New Jersey typically structure their <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">companies as C corporations, S corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies</a>. These structures differ for tax purposes - specifically whether the owner pays personal or business income:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;">C corps: Pay income taxes at the business level.</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/law-firm-insights/business-law/s-corporation-business/" target="_blank">LLCs, S corps and partnerships</a>: Pay personal or business taxes on their share of the company's income.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LLCs, S corps and partnerships are beneficial in New Jersey because the rate for individual returns has been lower than C corps since 2006. In fact, according to a New Jersey Business interview with Ronald J. Ruggeri, principal of MSPC Certified Public Accountants and Advisors, PC, <a href="http://njbmagazine.com/monthly_articles/small-businesses-cope-with-taxing-situations/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">C corps are not common in the state anymore</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"We don't really see too many C corporations these days; that way, if you operate at a loss in any given year, you get to carry that loss forward to reduce future taxable income or be entitled to a refund," Ruggeri explained. "New Jersey looks at each year in a vacuum; whatever happens in that year happens in that year, and it can put small business owners at a disadvantage."</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">If you are a New Jersey small business owner and you are unsure of your personal or business tax obligations to the state, the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">attorneys at Scarinci Hollenbeck can help</a>. We can sit down with you to help you navigate through your tax requirements so that you can continue to grow your business without tax liability.

		<content><![CDATA[The following is an excerpt from a notice that was issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of Treasury of the State of New Jersey.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">NOTICE TO QUALIFIED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN URBAN ENTERPRISE ZONES
EXPIRATION OF URBAN ENTERPRISE ZONES</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Effective December 31, 2016 at 11:59 p.m.</strong></p>
On December 31, 2016, at 11:59 p.m., <strong>five</strong> Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZ) will expire. Your UEZ-qualified business will be immediately affected if located in one of these five zones.

Beginning January 1, 2017, your business can no longer collect Sales Tax at a reduced rate. Your business must collect and remit Sales Tax at the full effective Sales Tax rate of 6.875%.

Your business will receive an ST-2, Sales Tax Certificate of Authority, which will replace your UZ-2, Urban Enterprise Zone Certificate of Authority. Your UZ-2 expires December 31, 2016, at 11:59 p.m.

<strong>The Bottom Line</strong>

This change will require taxpayers to modify software and procedures to comply. Invariably, there will be mistakes that state auditors will find and use to establish an error rate in sales and use tax audits. What is more difficult to determine is the impact that this will have on budgets and projections for operations in those districts. Many projects counted on the savings for those services that were not exempt from sales tax.

Recently, the IRS issued regulations to clarify definitions of partnership disguised sales and allocation of liabilities. The new regulations have two specific stipulations relating to final and temporary and proposed rules:
<ul>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><p>The temporary and proposed regulations will provide rules and guidance for the allocation of liabilities and obligations in identifying if a debt falls under a "recourse partnership liability."</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><p>The final regulations cover disguised sales of property - both made by or to a partnership - and "excess nonrecourse liabilities" allocations to partners.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What are disguised sales?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The regulation will prevent partners from <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/partnerships/" target="_blank">changing sales or property exchanges as contribution to the partnerships</a>. Specifically, one partner cannot deem the proceeds as revenue generated from the partnership. Because this revenue could be placed as a distribution by the partnership, whereupon partners could either avoid or defer tax payments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are certain exceptions to what falls under the disguised sales regulation. Most notably, debt financed distributions do not fall under the rule. To receive this exception though, partners need to provide the necessary paper trail to prove that partnership distributions can be tracked as one partner borrowing from another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Rules on capital expenditures changed</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The manner in which capital expenditures are treated under the rules has changed as well. There are three clarifications that the regulations make:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><p>Specify how capital expenditures for multiple property transfers fit into the exception.</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><p>Define capital expenditure items that fall under the exception.</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;"><p>Provide a final ruling on the exceptions with regards to "preformation" capital expenditures and liabilities stemming from capital expenditures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What this means is that whenever partners receive financing or a disguised sale transaction from another partner, there will be no exceptions for preformation capital expenditures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What are allocations of liabilities?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under temporary regulations, a partner needs to use the same calculations to determine another partner's excess nonrecourse liabilities shares as they would in calculating a partner's shares of partnership liabilities in the event of disguised sales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Implementation dates</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All temporary, proposed and final regulations were effective on Oct. 5, 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final regulations apply to any transaction or liabilities brought on by a partner after Oct. 5, 2016. Any monetary transfers that occur after that date need to have a contract in place before then.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the temporary regulations, the implementation date began on Oct. 5, 2016. However, the proposed regulations are effective on the date they become final regulations.</span></p>

<strong>What the changes mean</strong>

Individuals who own assets worth more than $5.49 million at their death could have to pay a 40 percent federal estate tax on the amount in excess of the exemption. The exemption increased by $40,000 from the 2016 amount.

However, even bigger changes to the estate tax could be in the works. According to Forbes contributor Ashlea Ebeling, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2016/11/09/will-trump-victory-yield-estate-tax-repeal/#5a8207f82bf2" target="_blank">President-elect Donald Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax</a> and replace it with a carryover basis regime for estates valued at $10 million or more. The latter provision would act as a sort of capital gains tax.

Ebeling quoted Trump's campaign website, which said that the new capital gains tax, if implemented, would be designed to exempt small businesses and family farms. More than a few institutions have speculated as to what this capital gains after death tax would look like.

But will Trump's plan go through? Charles Fox, an estate lawyer from Charlottesville, Virginia, told Ebeling that Trump's plan could face resistance from Republicans.

"My guess is that any proposal that Mr. Trump offers with the support of the House would face lukewarm reception in the Senate," said Fox. "Anything on estate tax would have to be part of an overall tax reform effort, a compromise on both sides."

All agree that the Internal Revenue Code is complicated and there are two cases in the historical tax credit area that illustrate this point and the risk one faces in entering into a tax credit deal.</p>

<em><strong>Virginia Historic Tax Credit Fund 2001 LP v. Comr.</strong>,</em> 639 F.3d 129 (CA-4 2011), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals treated the funds paid by the investors to the partnership as a taxable sale rather than a tax-free contribution by partners. At the level below (Tax Court), the IRS argued that the investors were not partners, but lost on that point. The Court of Appeals did not disturb the lower court’s ruling on that issue; instead, the Court held the transfer of state credits was a disguised sale. A <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">transaction between a partnership and a partner</a> may be treated as a transaction between a partnership and one who is not a partner. The income tax consequence is that the investor’s tax-free contribution of capital to the partnership is transformed into gross sales proceeds to the non-contributing partners. Thus, the tax-free transaction is scuttled. Prior to this decision, most viewed qualifying as a partner to be enough to secure the credit.

The upper court held that the state tax credits were property for federal tax purposes and this upset a long-standing notion between transferrable and non-transferrable state tax credits. A credit that cannot be transferred is allocated to partners. A credit that can be transferred is property once transferred and causes gain to be recognized equal to the difference between the tax liability satisfied by the credit and the amount paid to obtain it. A <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">federal income tax deduction</a> results from the use of the credit to pay tax. (An argument was also made that the state credit is not property because the Virginia credit was not transferable and IRS cannot exert a meaningful lien.)

In <strong><em>Historic Boardwalk Hall, LLC</em></strong> 694 F.3d 425 (CA-3. 2012) Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that the tax credit investors were not true partners. In the decision being appealed, the Tax Court' ruled the transactions had economic substance and allowing the investor to invest in the hall's rehabilitation was legitimate. The Tax Court held that the investor had project risk and was a bona fide partner. The Third Circuit held that the investor had no meaningful downside risk because it recoup contributions it had made to the partnership. The court added there was no upside potential for the investor. Cases use many factors to determine if one is a partner.

<strong>Who is a true equity partner?</strong>

Who is a true equity partner? Consider some of the following points. The Second Circuit case of <em>TIFD III-E, Inc. v. U.S.</em>, 459 F.3d 220 (CA-2, 2006), popularly known as "Castle Harbour", held that foreign banks' purported partnership interest were a secured lender's interest unaffected by poor performance or by extraordinary profits. In both tax credit cases, the courts found no realistic relationship between the investment amount and the percentage of ownership. If there is no true participation in profit or risk of loss, the disproportionate allocation of credits will not be respected.

Although there is a revenue procedure safe-harbor, the area is not for the timid.

The government lost estate and gift tax cases that attracted headlines. In response, the Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) proposed new regulations in early 2016 that would amend definitions in the 1992 regulations that were problematic in the court cases. In addition, Treasury it added requirements designed to defeat valuation discounts in the estate and gift tax areas.

<strong>The 1992 Regulation</strong>

The 1992 regulation gave IRS the right to disregard certain provisions in shareholder partnership and operating agreements for purposes of <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">estate and gift tax valuation</a>. The 1992 regulations defined an applicable restriction, however, it applied only to a transferor and members of his or her family. An applicable restriction effectively limits the ability to liquidate the entity (in whole or in part) and is more restrictive than a limitation imposed by state law. The law in many states limits the ability of a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company to liquidate the entity. The result was that one could rely upon state law to avoid any problem. A second aspect of the regulation was the definition of a lapse. A liquidation right would lapse when it was eliminated or restricted, so the mere transfer of an interest that held such a right was not a lapse. These rules provided a clear framework for planning and were an obstacle for the government.

<strong>The Proposed Regulations</strong>

The proposed regulations created a new class of restrictions called disregarded restrictions which are focused on impacting valuation. The first disregarded restrictions is any provision that limits or permits liquidation can be disregarded. Second, any amount received on liquidation or redemption is disregarded if it is less than minimum value. Minimum value is the pro rata share of the enterprise and this prevents discounts. Third, payment is deferred beyond six months after notice of liquidation is given may also be disregarded. Fourth, the agreement permits payment to be in any manner other than cash or property. Debt obligations of the entity are not property for this purpose unless the entity is engaged in an active trade or business.

The proposed regulations address state law restrictions. Only a state or federal law restriction that cannot be changed by the governing documents will not be an applicable restriction. In most states, the statute is the default rule so it is expected that any restrictions would have to be imposed by the written agreement. This change would impact discounts for lack of control and was intended as such.

The 1992 rules only applied to families while the proposed rules would expand coverage beyond the prior definition of family. An interest owned by a non-family member would be disregarded unless: (i) it was held for three years before the transfer under examination; (ii) the interest constituted 10% or more of the equity; (iii) nonfamily members must own 20% or more of the equity; and (iv) the nonfamily member has a put right on the terms specified in the proposed rules.

<strong>Additional Changes</strong>

There are additional changes, such as an assignee’s interest would be treated as a lapse in order to reduce or eliminate discounts which have haunted the IRS in the past. Finally, there are inconsistencies in the application of the effective date or dates. For example, if the new regulations are effective upon adoption or 30 days thereafter, then how can the rules require that an interest of a non-family member be held for three years? In effect, a blackout period is created by regulation.

What is clear is that Treasury and the IRS want to end discounts. The public hearing on the regulations attracted many negative comments from small business owners and professional organizations. This outcry and a change in the administration may put these regulations on hold. <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">Succession planning faces a major hurdle</a> if these rules are ever adopted in the present form.

While President-elect <a href="/trump-tax-strategy/" target="_blank">Donald Trump has his own tax plan</a>, the House GOP formulated an approach of its own. The House GOP Tax Reform Blueprint positions itself <a href="http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Tax-PolicyPaper.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s2">as a growth-friendly plan</span></a>, one that encourages business investment and simplifies filing.

If the Blueprint were to come into effect, what would that mean for your business? What is the House GOP proposing?
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The GOP's tax reform proposals<b> </b>
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the current system, many small and closely held businesses operate as partnerships and S corporations. The Blueprint noted that such organizations are taxed under the individual rate structure. In other words, they file as people instead of businesses. The GOP speculated that this system puts partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships at a competitive disadvantage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the Blueprint, sole proprietorships and other pass-through entities will no longer be subjected to the individual tax rate. The maximum rate a small business would have to pay on income would be 25 percent. According to the House GOP, this rate represents "the lowest top tax rate on the income of [pass-through entities] since before World War II."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, the compensation small-business owners earn through their operations will be deductible. However, that income earned will be subject to tax at the progressive rate, which consists of three brackets: </span><span class="s1">(1) 12 percent, </span><span class="s1">(2) 25 percent and (3) </span><span class="s1">33 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What about corporations? In contrast to Trump's plan, the corporate tax rate would stay flat at 20 percent under the Blueprint's provisions. If implemented, this tax cut would be the largest in U.S. history. Corporations would also no longer have to pay the alternative minimum tax, which requires enterprises to add back deductions and credits <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i4626.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s3">reported on</span><span class="s2"> the</span><span class="s3"> income</span><span class="s2"> tax </span><span class="s3">return </span></a></span><span class="s4">to calculate the alternative minimum tax</span><span class="s1">, according to the Internal Revenue Service. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Elimination of the estate tax
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Blueprint also noted its intentions to get rid of the estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax. So, if the owner of a sole proprietorship dies and leaves his or her business to his or her children, the latter won't have to pay taxes to obtain ownership. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, eliminating these taxes would <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">simplify the estate transfer process</a>, thereby minimizing operational disruption. Roll back of the Death Tax, which can double the amount of taxes small businesses and farms have to pay, would ease the financial burden of staying above water.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How will the tax plan effect the economy?<b> </b>
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tax Foundation conducted an analysis of the Blueprint, noting that under the proposed tax plan, the cost of capital investment <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan" target="_blank"><span class="s2">will be fully deductible</span></a>. However, it will also eliminate all other business credits except for the ones that apply to research and development. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Overall, how will the House GOP's new tax plan impact the economy? Over the long term, the Tax Foundation predicted the Blueprint would increase GDP by 9.1 percent and create 1.6 million jobs. In addition, capital investment would rise 28.3 percent and the wage rate would increase 7.7 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether the Blueprint comes into effect is anybody's guess. If it does, however, <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">small businesses may spend less time filing for taxes</a>.</span></p>

Is it easy to do <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/business-tax/small-business-tax-mistakes/" target="_blank">business in New Jersey</a>? According to a recent report by the Tax Foundation, a research group that analyzes tax policies across the nation, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6586UGJDFOLTHNLYTJrYW1LekE/view" target="_blank">the state has room for improvement</a>.

The organization released its "2017 State Business Tax Climate Index," which sought to determine how well each state structured its tax systems, comparing them with each other to identify states with the best and worst business environments.
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How the Tax Foundation conducted its analysis </strong></p>
Instead of judging each state based on how much individuals, small businesses and corporations had to pay in taxes, the Tax Foundation analyzed the simplicity of each tax system, and whether those systems encouraged businesses to either leave or remain in one state or another.

The Foundation maintained that a state could have all major taxes (the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">corporate income tax, the individual income tax and the sales tax</a>) but still offer an economic climate in which businesses could prosper. For instance, although Utah imposes all three taxes on its residents and businesses, the organization ranked the state as the 9th best state in the country.
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where New Jersey stood</strong></p>
Across the board, New Jersey ranked on the lower end of the nation. With respect to corporate taxes, New Jersey rang in at 42. The report also noted the state had the worst property tax rate in the U.S. Overall, the state's tax code is quite complex, which may discourage current businesses from relocating to New Jersey in the near future.

While the Foundation ranked New Jersey as having the worst tax system in the nation, the organization conducted the report before<a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/business-tax/nj-tax-changes-2017/" target="_blank"> the state made a serious change to its tax code by eliminating the estate tax.</a> Lexology noted that Governor Chris Christie signed legislation that <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=313cb8be-b146-4707-b5d0-be601697761f" target="_blank">will repeal the estate tax</a> for those who either die on or after January 1, 2018.

In addition, the new law will increase the estate tax exclusion amount from $675,000 to $2,000,000 for decedents who pass away on or after Jan. 1, 2017 but before January 1, 2018.

New Jersey, long known for its high property and income taxes, is trying to reverse course with a number of friendly legislative changes targeting the elderly, veterans and low-income workers.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Retired receive tax shelter</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While New Jersey isn't the only state to tax elderly on their limited income, legislators have agreed to raise the minimum threshold. News Works reported that this year, retired elderly will be able to <a href="http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/new-jersey/100126-new-jersey-deploys-tax-changes-for-elderly-and-veterans-in-2017" target="_blank"><span class="s2">exclude $40,000 </span><span class="s3">of pension and retirement </span><span class="s2">from state income tax</span></a>—double what they could the previous year. This figure will rise to $100,000 for joint-filers by 2020, and $75,000 for single</span><span class="s4"> filer</span><span class="s1">s.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"For most people who are retired, they're living on Social Security, which New Jersey does not tax, and they're living on either pensions or IRA distributions," Bernard Kiely, a certified financial planner, told the news source. "So, a whole lot of retirees will no longer pay <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">New Jersey income tax</a>."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An income tax break will also be extended to veterans, and tax credits given to low-income workers will increase from <a href="http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/changes-new-jersey-2017/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">30 percent to 35 percent</span></a> of what the Federal government previously gave, according to New Jersey TV Online. The source reported this amounts to roughly $200.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also factoring into the picture is the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/business-tax/nj-tax-changes-2017/" target="_blank">removal of the state's estate tax</a>. While it will jump to $2 million this year, it </span><span class="s4">is currently scheduled to</span><span class="s1"> be completely erased from existence in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Other changes underway</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey seems to be in a state of perpetual tax change this year. By getting rid of the estate tax—a major point of contention for many elderly looking to leave money to their heirs—NJTV Online reported that the state is losing out on roughly $1.4 billion in annual revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although the $0.23 gas tax hike at the pump will add $1.2 billion to the operating budget, this money is strictly reserved for transportation proposals, and doesn't necessarily completely fill the gap left by the estate tax, according to NJTV Online.</span></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IC-disc.jpg" alt="IC-disc" /><p>Now that President Trump has made it a priority to bring back manufacturing to the United States, now might be the time to consider an IC-Disc (Interest Charge Domestic International Sale Corporation). An IC-Disc reflects a special tax preference enacted by Congress to strengthen export sales. If a domestic corporation qualifies and elects to be treated as an IC-Disc, it is permitted to defer up to $10,000,000 from qualified export receipts per tax year.</p>

The IC-Disc is a tax exempt entity, however, the shareholders are taxed on certain income of the IC-Disc whether or not it is distributed. The character of the commission income is a dividend; if not distributed during the year, it is a constructive dividend at the end of the year. Any remaining taxable amounts are taxed when actually distributed to the shareholder or where the corporation ceases to qualify as an IC-Disc.

Obviously, the IC-Disc provides an opportunity to defer income. To offset this tax advantage, the shareholders are subject to an interest charge based on the tax that would otherwise be due. The interest charge, reported on Form 8404, is the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">deferred tax liability</a> multiplied by the base period T-bill rate. In this environment of low interest rates, the interest charged would be very low.

<strong>Tax benefit of an IC-Disc</strong>

The other main tax benefit of using an IC-Disc is that the difference between qualified dividend rates and ordinary income rates is the tax benefit afforded to the shareholders. This benefit can provide a substantial savings. A US exporter would be able to convert a portion of the export income into dividends thereby converting the tax rate from 35% to 20%. Example – exporting company XPE forms an IC-Disc. It pays and deducts commission to the IC-Disc. The commission reduces otherwise taxable income. The IC-Disc pays no tax on the commissions but still pay interest on the deferred income and the shareholders are not taxed until the earnings are distributed as dividends – currently 20%.

<strong>Qualifications of an IC-Disc</strong>

An IC-Disc must meet each of the following tests (1) it must be a <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank">domestic corporation</a>; (2) it must have only one class of stock and must have stated value of $2,500 on each day of the taxable year; (3) it must elect disc status; at least 95% of its gross receipts must be export related; at least 95% of its assets, taken at adjusted basis at the close of the taxable year must be export related; and (4) the IC-Disc cannot be, among other things, an S corporation and will usually be a C corporation. The IC-Disc is often a separate entity typically established in a state which has favorable state law tax provisions.

There are transfer pricing rules which govern IC-Discs but generally, the IC-Disc can <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">realize taxable income</a> equal to 4% of the qualified export receipts on the sale by the IC-Disc plus 10% of the export promotion expenses, sometimes known as the “4% Method.” There are other intercompany pricing rules that could be used as well. As the IC-Disc itself is not a taxable entity, the shareholders are taxed on the earnings of the IC-Disc as dividends received on the last day of each tax year.

Notably, the EU has not challenged IC-Disc’s. Moreover, coupling IC-Discs with Section 1199 can achieve additional saving. Finally, an IC-Disc may be used for wealth planning.

Tax season starts January 23 and there are a few changes that come with it in 2017, including an adjustment to the final day you can file for 2016.

<strong>Delays abound</strong>

Normally, you have to file your taxes by April 15—it has become an unofficial holiday. But this year, the Internal Revenue Services has extended that to April 18.

This is because April 15 falls on a Saturday this year, which would normally push the final filing date to Monday. Due to Emancipation Day being observed in Washington, D.C., on April 17, tax-paying Americans are getting one extra day if they feel the need to procrastinate. Be sure to consult with your tax advisor and have everything sent by April 18.

Furthermore, in an effort to combat fraud, filers who claim a child tax credit, earned income credit or education credits should expect their returns to undergo additional scrutiny that could delay the processing of their returns and refunds. KMVT suggested the earliest a refund would be returned is by February 27.

<strong>Increases in deductions and deductibles for 2017</strong>

Health care coverage deductible limits are increasing ever so slightly by $50 for self-employed people, according to WKYC. This includes:
<ul>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;">Max limit for out-of-pocket expenses for self-only coverage : $4,550.</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;">Family coverage minimum and max limit: $4,550 and $6,800, respectively.</li>
 <li style="padding: 1%; list-style-type: square; margin-left: 60px; line-height: 1.6em !important;">Out-of-pocket expenses for family coverage: $8,350 ($100 increase).</li>
</ul>
Also, seniors looking to itemize deductions for medical expenses will see a change next year. The standard deduction claim requires health care costs to exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income. A loophole allowed seniors to lower the threshold to 7.5 percent, but that's being done away with for years after 2016.

<strong>Changes this tax season from Donald Trump</strong>

President Donald Trump made a number of promises on his campaign trail, and should he choose to enact his tax plan in 2017, it could actually affect your 2016 filing efforts. The changes can be made retroactively, and those who aren't paying attention may miss out on some big changes.

David Prokupek, chief executive officer of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, reviewed Trump's proposal and estimated the standard deduction would double for most people, according to New Jersey Biz. This deduction is given when the filer doesn't itemize anything. Prokupek pointed to joint-filing married couples, who would see their's increase from $12,700 to $30,000.

Similarly, those making between $9,000 and $37,000 would see their tax rate fall from 15 percent to 12 percent, and people filing between $91,000 and $112,000 would also see a 3 percent decrease, from 28 percent to a 25 percent tax rate.

While it remains to be seen what comes of these changes, Prokupek is a believer that they'll have a positive effect on taxpayers and the economy. Of course, there's always two sides of a coin, and it's especially important to <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">recognize both when it comes to tax law</a>.

For instance, while the standard tax deductions are being raised, this in turn means the public can expect personal exemptions to be eliminated. Furthermore, Trump has said he wants to remove the head of household filing status, which would imply that single parents would lose significant tax breaks as they would have to file as single instead. Ultimately, those who are near the top of their tax bracket as they currently stand could see themselves moving up to a higher bracket because of the proposed changes.

These are some of the most important things to keep your eye on as we venture into tax filing season, but other revisions to tax brackets and breaks are on the docket as well, albeit in a minor fashion.

Although it's still in the early stages and nothing is certain, experts around the industry are advocating for companies to be prepared.</p>

<strong>Stay on your toes</strong>

The Trump administration's promise to create friendlier business taxes has the stock market flying high, but as of now, nothing has been set in stone. Recently, a U.S. Republican lawmaker told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that the corporate tax <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-tax-idUSKBN1582AE" target="_blank">reduction into the 15 to 20 percent range</a> being sought by President Donald Trump will be difficult to pass, according to Reuters.

The lawmaker specifically honed in on the need to pass what's known as border adjustability. Essentially, for the corporate tax cuts to be passed, the export tariff would have to be erased, while the import tax could see a rise to 20 percent, the source reported. This would have dramatic implications on a number of industries, including automakers and retailers.

A number of other legal bouts are currently being waged, according to CPA Practice Advisor. These include <a href="http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12298743/the-top-five-business-tax-issues-of-2017" target="_blank">corporate rate reductions and a new tax system</a> where the only income taxed is that which is earned inside the U.S.

"U.S. tax reform is more than just rate reduction, and any plan will likely have winners and losers. Company leaders need to model the impact of various proposals, aggressively engage with legislators and make their voices heard as the process moves ahead," KPMG's Jeffrey LeSage told the source.

As nothing is certain just yet, CPAPA recommended all chief tax officers stay tuned in to what's happening on Capitol Hill so they can be prepared for any change that could come at a moment's notice.

<strong>Ditch the pen and paper</strong>

LeSage also urged businesses to bring their tax departments into the digital era with a number of different tools, like platforms to analyze data, automation and even cognitive intelligence.

Not only will the aforementioned changes give your employees the gadgets they need to boost productivity and effectiveness, but they also allow them to be agile within their sector. The new regulations and legal updates approaching will mean compliance changes are ahead. Tax officers should be able to quickly ascertain any potential risk and ensure the business' taxes are completed without potential liability.

Further to this point, partnering with an agency with years of <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">experience working within the business tax law landscape</a> could turn into a fruitful relationship as companies are likely to have their fair share of questions and concerns moving forward. Spending the money on a tax consultant could potentially save an organization from innumerable fines down the line.

<strong>Seek new talent</strong>

In line with the aforementioned point, CPAPA reported businesses will need to broaden the type of qualifications they look for in new hires, specifically pertaining to their tax departments. The word of 2017 is "nimble," according to LeSage, and the skill set employees have in this sector will largely dictate the success of the company.

"Sometimes it's tough to attract, develop and retain these professionals in tax departments," LeSage told CPAPA. "Savvy leaders know that investing in rotations, cognitive training and leadership experience will help their people develop the skill sets and knowledge they need for them and their companies to succeed."

Companies without the financial resources to hire new employees or revamp training to accommodate the changing business tax law landscape should consider turning to an <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">experienced tax professional</a> that can help identify which areas the organization is lacking in, and perhaps provide assistance in a number of different ways. The new year is primed for upheaval in the industry, and employers that are active, diligent and agile will ultimately avoid any unnecessary headaches.

When someone dies, the people left behind are often stunned and shocked by the taxes they have to pay. They hear all kinds of scary terms like “estate tax” and “inheritance tax,” and they don’t know what the difference between the two is, or even if there’s a difference at all.

People fear what will happen if they don’t pay the right amount, and don’t know how to determine what the right amount might be. Explore a primer on the similarities and differences between an estate tax and inheritance tax, and how a New Jersey tax attorney can help you.

<strong>Death Taxes: Estate vs. Inheritance</strong>

Ever since the most recent changes to the New Jersey inheritance tax and estate tax laws, which occurred as a result of the same bill that raised the gas tax in the state, there has been confusion about the difference between the two. Estate and inheritance taxes are two different taxes, but both fall under the<a href="http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2017/02/biz_brain_estate_tax_inheritance_tax_a_primer_for.html" target="_blank"> overall umbrella of death taxes</a>.

<strong>Federal Tax</strong>

The federal government has an estate tax, but no inheritance tax. Currently, this tax rate is at 40 percent, with an exemption of $5.49 million. This tax rate is applied to the taxable portions of the estate that exceed the exemption amount, and tax is reported and paid on the estate tax return of the decedent.

The taxable estate is, in general, based on the current market value of the assets possessed by the decedent on the date of their passing. This total is then reduced by debts, expenses and certain other liabilities as well as deductions like unlimited charitable and marital deductions. The remaining amount after all deductions is then subject to the estate tax to the extent that it exceeds the exemption amount.

<strong>New Jersey Estate Tax</strong>

The New Jersey estate tax currently exists and works much like the federal tax, but with an exemption of $2 million, for decedents dying after January 1, 2017, and a 16% tax rate. This means an estate tax is only paid on estates worth more than the exemption amount, and the tax is 16% of the portion that exceeds the exemption, minus allowable deductions. It’s important to note that currently the estate tax in the Garden State is scheduled to be repealed at the beginning of 2018. However, with a gubernatorial election between now and then, the scheduled repeal is in doubt.

<strong>New Jersey Inheritance Tax</strong>

An inheritance tax is based on the beneficiary’s relationship to the decedent as well as the amount received by the beneficiary. The federal government does not impose an inheritance tax, but New Jersey does. Spouses, children, and grandchildren are exempt in New Jersey, but siblings, nieces, and nephews are not. Each category of the beneficiary is subject to its own exemption amount and tax rate.

However, the current books are written in such a way that inheritance and estate taxes offset one another. This means that, in theory, no one should pay more through the combination of taxes than they would normally pay for the greater of the two when calculated separately.

<strong>New Jersey Tax Attorney</strong>

It’s tricky to understand the death taxes in New Jersey, the classes of beneficiaries, and the tax rates paid based on the different levels of an estate, relationships and the like. If you’re facing the need to close an estate, it can be helpful to talk with a qualified and <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/">experienced New Jersey tax attorney</a>.

A recent newsletter stated that a common business structure for independent broker-dealers suffered a setback in Tax Court when the IRS prevailed. The individual, a broker-dealer held several series licenses to annuities and other financial products. The individual, not his corporation, signed contracts with LPL and Mass Mutual. The corporation elected S status and in 2010 paid the individual salary of $35,000 and dividend income of $147,000. The desired tax savings would result from the dividends escaping self-employment tax. The $147,000 dividend initially escaped self-employment tax but not the attention of the IRS which issued an assessment for $42,000 covering 2010 and two other years. The Tax Court held in <em>Fleischer v. CIR</em> (T.C. Memo 2016-28) that the individual controlled the right to receive this income in exchange for his efforts and it was compensation subject to self-employment tax. It appears Fleischer was the only employee.

The Court held that the taxpayer failed the <em>Johnson Test</em> which determines who controls the activity resulting in the income. This test has two prongs and the taxpayer failed both. First, the individual providing the service must be a true employee of the corporation and the corporation must be able to direct and control the employee. Second, the recipient or user of the services must have a contract or arrangement with the corporation.
<h2>Johnson v. United States</h2>
Johnson v. United States, <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/698/698.F2d.372.81-4621.html">698 F.2d 372</a> (9th Cir. 1982). In Johnson, a professional basketball player assigned his salary to a corporation in exchange for the right to receive monthly payments for life from the corporation. The player then claimed only the monthly payments as income. We concluded that the entire salary amount was taxable. Over the following years, many athletes tried various modifications of this strategy without success. Essentially, these strategies sought to avoid payroll tax or to have income taxed at the then much lower corporate rates. Typically, the later strategy was coupled with a defined benefit plan requiring substantial contributions that were tax deductions to the corporation.

Lest we think that broker-dealers and athletes are the only taxpayers using this structure, there have been repeated attempts by lawyers and accountants to press this approach. A court in another case remarked on two attorneys who were the sole shareholders of an S corporation and performed all of the legal work. They reported no compensation and received only dividends. The court stated that: <em>To reach the conclusion that the payments were dividends would require the court to accept that [the shareholders] were providing legal services on behalf of the corporation without regard to receiving payment for legal services.</em>
<h2>Fleischer article</h2>
The article on <em>Fleischer</em> commented that operating as an S corporation is a common business structure for broker-dealers. It is also useful for other taxpayers but any analysis of utility must be tempered by the reality of the circumstances. A corporation acts through its employees and it is hard to provide services without personal effort being expended.

Decades ago, rock bands would contract with a corporation in a favorable treaty country and then go on tour. The loan-out corporation would contract, at a price that would absorb substantial profits, with a domestic corporation that conducts the tour. The loan-out company would then pay the band in the low-tax jurisdiction thereby escaping all or virtually all tax. Every treaty was amended to prevent this.

Taxes have become easier than ever to send in due to TurboTax and similar programs that<span class="s2"> claim to</span><span class="s1"> help first-timers file their returns like seasoned veterans.</span>

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But with the ease </span><span class="s2">of electronic filing</span><span class="s1"> also comes a very real danger: Tax fraud. It's not a new concept, but as with many areas of society, laws and regulations have yet to catch up with the schemes criminals are using to game the system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Growing threat</b> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Americans relying more on credit cards and online shopping, identity fraud has quickly become the crime of choice for many thieves. Javelin Strategy and Research found that <a href="http://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/identity-theft-and-cybercrime" target="_blank"><span class="s3">$112 billion has been stolen</span></a> from consumers over just the past six years, but criminals aren't just using that information to buy electronics or drain a bank account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, they're going one step further by filing</span><span class="s2"> false</span><span class="s1"> tax returns. The previously arduous task is now easier than ever, making it a prime target to squeeze out a few thousand dollars from victims. According to U.S. News &amp; World report, nearly <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/taxes/articles/2017-02-09/what-to-do-if-someone-files-a-fraudulent-tax-return-in-your-name" target="_blank"><span class="s3">237,000 people went to file</span></a> their taxes in 2015, only to find out someone else beat them to the punch. The Internal Revenue Service is getting a handle on the situation, though, as it stopped almost 787,000 bogus tax returns from seeking $4 billion in refunds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a measure to stop tax return fraud at the state level, many governing bodies are now requiring driver's licenses to be recorded if a person want's to e-file, according to Accounting Today. Some states have made this a mandatory measure, like New York and Ohio. Others, such as California and Wisconsin, don't yet demand filers to give identification, but instead request it. It's likely this will be a fast-moving trend adopted by the entire country at some point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Since last summer, the Federation of Tax Administrators, the IRS, and the tax preparation software industry have been working together to establish more robust security measures for the detection and prevention of refund fraud," a statement from acting director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, John Ficara, read. "These security measures include several new data elements, both required and optional, to be provided by the taxpayer when utilizing tax preparation software to complete and file income tax returns. Driver license information will be an optional data element when filing electronically this year."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Were you defrauded of your tax return?</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you find yourself a victim of this crime, know that there are a few options you can take. First and foremost, though, U.S. News &amp; World Report recommended taking back control of your finances. Alert your banking institution and the three federal credit agencies that your identity has been stolen, and go through any means necessary to restore full control over your identity. Remember, if they've filed a tax return in your name, they have your social security number.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you're lucky, you'll receive </span><span class="s2">notification</span><span class="s1"> from the IRS stating they found a fraudulent return in your name and declined it. If that happens, you'll be free to file your return as you normally would after taking the aforementioned precautions to protect yourself against identity theft. But, the news source warned that the IRS budget is stretched thin, meaning there isn't a lot of manpower tasked to catching tax return fraud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After finding out your tax return has already been </span><span class="s2">processed</span><span class="s1">, you'll want to fill out <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="s3">form 14039</span></a> and send it into the IRS agency. If you haven't put a freeze on your bank account and alerted the banking institution and credit agencies, now is the time to do so. After</span><span class="s2"> that</span><span class="s1">, U.S. News &amp; World Report recommended filing a police report.</span><span class="s2"> You may also want to</span><span class="s1"> file a report with the Federal Trade Commission. The organization will be able to give you more advice on how to move further.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once all that is done, consider meeting with a local tax attorney. Not only can they suggest reputable tax preparers to work with moving forward—in the off chance you were scammed by your former tax preparer if you hadn't filed online—but they can help you assess the best course of action to take moving forward. No one is more experienced in the realm, and it's certainly worth the money to receive counsel from those who have seen cases like yours countless times before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving forward, you'll be in the business of getting better prepared. It's highly recommended you obtain a tax filing pin. This will ensure criminals can't file your tax returns, but be wary—if you lose it, you won't be able to file either.</span></p>

In its 2016 New Jersey Small Business Profile, the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy said there were <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/New_Jersey.pdf"><span class="s2">820,303 small businesses</span></a> in the Garden State.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Owning a small business comes with numerous benefits. Between the independence, flexibility, power and personal fulfillment, it's an opportunity to put all of your energy into something you're truly passionate about. With so much power, however, there are tax implications that need to be recognized. This is especially critical in New Jersey, as the state has the <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/7_reasons_why_njs_property_taxes_are_highest_in_us.html"><span class="s2">highest property taxes in the nation</span></a>, according to <a href="http://nj.com/"><span class="s2">NJ.com</span></a>. Beyond property tax, business owners in the Garden State should understand how other taxes can affect them.</span></p>
<b>Income tax</b>

What are some of the biggest mistakes made among business owners? Those involved with income tax, according to New Jersey Business Magazine. Ryan Malone, the principal at Flackman, Goodman &amp; Potter, LLP, said some businesses find it challenging to pay income taxes without borrowing, especially when they're rapidly expanding.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Many new small business owners will 'reinvest' in their business' capital equipment using the cash from operations, leaving the potential for a situation where there isn't enough cash to pay the tax on the profits," he said. "The new business owner sees this as money spent. However, it doesn't all reduce taxable income at the time it was spent."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our advice: Always budget and <a href="http://budgeting.thenest.com/calculate-monthly-income-tax-27959.html"><span class="s2">calculate your monthly income tax</span></a>.</span></p>
<b>Property tax</b>

As a business owner, you must understand how your property taxes are determined. According to the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, there are <a href="http://www.njslom.org/tax_brochure.html"><span class="s2">six basic factors</span></a>. Those include:
        
        <ul style="margin-left:50px; list-style-type:circle;">
 <li><p>Market value.</p></li>
 <li><p>The cost of municipal and county programs and services.</p></li>
 <li><p>Costs of local public schools.</p></li>
 <li><p>Availability of other revenues to cover costs.</p></li>
 <li><p>The presence of tax-exempt properties in your municipality.</p></li>
 <li><p>The total value of all taxable proprieties in your municipality.</p></li>
        </ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some point, many business owners may consider renovations or additions on their current building to grow their business, accommodate more customers and increase the overall worth of the company. This makes the property more valuable, which then increases the property tax. Business owners need to keep this in mind when making such renovations, as it will impact spending and staying within their budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sales tax</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Business owners have a responsibility to collect sales tax. It's a personal liability that will impact the business as a whole. Ronald J Ruggeri, principal of Cranford-based MSPC Certified Public Accountants and Advisors, P.C., told New Jersey Business Magazine that nearly <a href="https://njbmagazine.com/monthly_articles/small-businesses-cope-with-taxing-situations/"><span class="s2">90 percent of audits</span></a> in the state arise due to issues with sales tax. Neglecting to collect and report sales tax at the point of sale can negatively impact the business.</span></p>
"The state knows there's a lot of money to be made from collecting sales tax," he explains. "The audit can be very intrusive, and since there's no statute of limitations on sales tax, they can go back as far as they'd like."
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Use tax</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey issues a use tax on goods </span><span class="s2">purchased out-of-state or online </span><span class="s1">that in-state business owners didn't pay </span><span class="s2">sales </span><span class="s1">tax</span><span class="s1"> on or </span><span class="s3">they</span><span class="s1"> paid sales tax on at a lower rate than they would have </span><span class="s2">if they had made the purchases </span><span class="s1">in New Jersey. Therefore, if you're making any business transactions while you're traveling </span><span class="s2">or if you’re shopping online to find the best prices or largest inventory</span><span class="s1">, it's critical you're saving receipts or keeping track of your purchases otherwise, according to what Vinay Navani, a certified public accountant, shared with The Star-Ledger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Let's say you go to Staples and buy office supplies. You go to the cash register and they charge you sales tax," he said. "If you order something online, that vendor may not have a location in New Jersey and so they don't have to remit sales tax. But then the obligation flips and now you have to pay use tax to the state."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don't keep track of these out-of-state </span><span class="s2">or online</span><span class="s1"> purchases, you'll be impacted in the event of an audit. Otherwise, the inspection should run smoothly.</span></p>
<b>Gas tax</b>

Last October, Governor Chris Christie signed a bill to raise the gasoline tax <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/christie_signs_23-cent_gas_tax_road_funding_deal.html"><span class="s2">23 cents per gallon</span></a> – the state's first tax increase on gas since 1988, according to <a href="http://nj.com/"><span class="s2">NJ.com</span></a>. By raising the gas tax, drivers are expected to pay more to fuel their cars - which impacts business owners who rely on drivers to deliver goods. Business owners will feel the impact as they reallocate budgets, setting aside more funds to make up for the gas tax.

It’s tax season again, and that means scrambling to pull together your documents and praying for that large refund. Unfortunately, it’s also a time of year when unscrupulous individuals come out of the woodwork looking to victimize innocent people.

Not only can scammers cost taxpayers thousands of dollars, but they can actually end up with the victim facing criminal prosecution if you listen to the wrong advice. Read an overview of the most common kinds of tax scams, as well as some advice to avoid getting yourself into trouble with the government this season.
<h2><strong>Things to Remember to Avoid Tax Scams</strong></h2>
There are three things that the IRS wants people to remember when it comes to falling victim to tax scams:
<ul style="margin-left: 50px; list-style-type: circle;">
 <li>You are responsible for all content on your tax return and liable for any inconsistencies or errors that occur.</li>
 <li>Beware of anyone who promises large refunds without even looking at your tax documents.</li>
 <li>Never sign any paperwork you haven’t carefully reviewed for accuracy.</li>
</ul>
By keeping these things in mind, you can help to avoid a number of common illegal tax schemes.
<h2><strong>Preparer Fraud</strong></h2>
Potentially the most common form of fraud to which taxpayers fall victim, the dishonest tax preparer is out to line their own pockets by using inflated fees and skimming of refunds. The problem gets worse, however, in that these fraudulent preparers will promise large refunds and may often falsify information to get more money so as to collect more.

When looking for a tax preparation professional, go with a reputable company and beware of offers that sound too good to be true—they probably are!
<h2><strong>Identity Theft Schemes</strong></h2>
Identity theft is another major problem in today’s high-tech society. Tax documents require disclosure of potentially damaging information, and thieves have used this information to clone or create phony credit cards, apply for loans, open mobile device accounts, access bank funds and more. Be very careful about to whom you reveal personal information, and know that the IRS does not use e-mail to contact taxpayers. If you get a communication from the IRS, you’re within your rights to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/beware-of-tax-scams" target="_blank">call them back to confirm</a>.
<h2><strong>Outlandish Arguments and Claims</strong></h2>
Some scammers will make outrageous claims to support their illegal activities. Among the more common include:
<ul style="margin-left: 50px; list-style-type: circle;">
 <li><a href="https://constitutionallawreporter.com/amendment-16/" target="_blank">The Sixteenth Amendment</a> which enables the government to collect income tax is illegal and was never ratified;</li>
 <li>Wages don’t count as taxable income;</li>
 <li>Paying taxes is actually voluntary;</li>
 <li>You can avoid filing a 1040 by <a href="https://constitutionallawreporter.com/amendment-04/" target="_blank">pleading the Fourth or Fifth Amendments</a>.</li>
</ul>
Be very clear: these and similar arguments are patently false. They have been tried and thrown out of court. While you can <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">contest your tax liabilities in court</a>, you can’t simply refuse to file or pay for that is illegal and could land you in a great deal of trouble.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This tax season, if you have any concerns about fraud or want more information about your taxes and tax laws this year, please contact me, <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/attorneys/amy-m-van-fossen/" target="_blank">Amy Van Fossen</a>, at 201-806-3364.</em></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<img class="alignright" src="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tax-filing.jpg" alt="Tax Season 2017: Last Minute Tax Filing Tips" />

Tax day is nearly a month away - Remember: it's April 18 this year, a few days after the traditional date. While there's still plenty of time to get your taxes filed, you may start feeling the pressure if you don't take care of the tedious task soon. If you're among the many procrastinators, have no fear - here are a few last-minute tax filing tips to ease the stress.

<b>Take care of things sooner than later</b>

Avoid putting the task off until hours before tax day. It's only going to leave you panicked and frustrated. As the Internal Revenue Service stated, rushing to beat the tax day deadline could result in <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/last-minute-tips-for-filing-your-taxes" target="_blank"><span class="s2">a mistake</span></a> or your missing out on deserved savings. If you wait until the last day, rush through the process and make an error, you could risk a delay in receiving your tax refund.

<b>Get yourself organized</b>

Once you're ready to get the ball rolling, start by getting organized. Whether you're going to file the taxes on your own or <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">hire a professional</a>, you need to have all of your documents prepared for reference as you fill out the tax form. Besides your Social Security number, you'll need W-2 forms for all employers you worked for in the last tax year, as well as investment income information, business income, Social Security benefits and more. To file safely and precisely, refer to this <a href="https://www.irs.com/articles/tax-form-checklist" target="_blank"><span class="s2">tax form checklist</span></a> provided by the IRS.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>File on time or file an extension</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you feel as though you're not going to make the deadline, be sure to file for an extension. Don't worry - this won't make you automatically stand out in a sea of tax papers to auditors. As Forbes stated, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/04/11/last-minute-tax-filing-tips/#5ff5afb7cc54" target="_blank">filing an extension will <span class="s2">cover your bases</span></a>. Plus, auditors will be more attracted to a flawed report that was filed without preparation.</span><span class="s3"> Keep in mind, however, that even if you extend your filing deadline, payment of your taxes is still due on April 18 this year.</span></p>
<b>File electronically</b>

By <a href="http://taxtrustestatenews.com/tax-fraud-in-electronic-filing/" target="_blank">filing your taxes electronically</a>, you'll reduce the chance of making errors - the software does the math for you. Plus, if you're expected to get money back, you won't have to worry about waiting for your return in the mail - it can be deposited directly into your bank account.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Seek assistance</b>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you're finding it difficult to file your taxes on own due to lack of experience, consider <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank">reaching out to a professional</a>. Hiring a tax preparer can save you the time, potential errors and the headache of filing on your own. Just keep in mind that it'll cost you, and it may be difficult to find a professional who's willing to take on the task this close to Tax Day.</span></p>

Here's what you need to know before filing for an extension:

<b>1. You must file for an extension to receive one</b>

Requesting an extension means <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-4868" target="_blank">you still have to file something</a>, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Instead of filing Form 1040, you'll file Form 4868. This application gives you a six-month extension, which means you won't have to file your taxes until October.

If you don't file for the extension,<a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/04/Need-Tax-Extension-5-Things-You-Should-Know" target="_blank"> you'll be penalized</a>, according to certified public accountant Troy Lewis.

"No one should go past April 18 without filing their return or filing for an extension," he told The Fiscal Times. "The consequences for failing to do so are just too severe." Failing to file for an extension gets you a five-percent penalty of your tax bill per month, up to 25 percent of the total balance. Make sure your paperwork is completed and filed by the due date to avoid the consequences.

<b>2. Anyone can file for an extension</b>

Every taxpayer is qualified for a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/04/11/7-things-know-before-filing-tax-extension/82265796/" target="_blank">six-month extension</a>, according to Glenn Brown, senior tax research analyst at the Tax Institute at H&amp;R Block.
"It's unbelievably easy to get an extension on your taxes," he told The Fiscal Times. "It's one of the few tax forms that's not confusing."

<b>3. More time to file does not give you more time to pay</b>

If you owe on your taxes this year, the extension does not give you breathing room in that aspect. The IRS is still expecting a portion of the payment from you in April, according to Curt Sheldon, president of financial planning firm C.L. Sheldon &amp; Co. "The IRS is pretty patient about getting a return, but they're not very patient about getting their money," he told USA Today.

Taxpayers still need to pay owed taxes by April 18 to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/need-an-extension-of-time-to-file-taxes" target="_blank">avoid late penalties</a>, according to the IRS.
<b>4. You may have to pay interest</b>

If you don't pay the full amount by the due date, you may have to pay interest on the difference, which builds up until you complete the payment. If you know that a late payment is unavoidable, reach out to an accountant who can estimate the amount of interest to expect.

<b>5. If you pay electronically, you'll get an automatic extension</b>

You can fill out Form 4868, a written application for automatic extension of time to file, but you have a more convenient option. If you make a full or partial payment electronically by the due date, you will automatically be eligible for an extension. This is advantageous for taxpayers, especially those who are already scrambling during tax season.

We all know that charging too little sales tax can lead to an assessment of unpaid taxes and penalties, but charging too much tax could result in problems, too.

<a href="http://www.lularoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popular fashion company LuLaRoe</a> found out about these effects when they had a complaint filed against them by a customer from the state of Pennsylvania who alleges she was charged sales tax when she should not have been. Her class action lawsuit alleges that LuLaRoe’s point-of-sale (POS) system, Audrey, automated charges based on erroneous billing practices that should have been based on the customer’s shipping address rather than the location of the “consultant” who helped to sell the goods through a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme.

Regardless of the outcome of the sales tax lawsuit, it is sure to send chills down the spine of e-commerce companies when it comes to their practices for taxing customers.
<h2><strong>The Facts of the Rachael Webster v. LLR, Inc. Sales Tax Lawsuit</strong></h2>
The plaintiff Rachael Webster filed a complaint against LLR, Inc. or “LuLaRoe” alleging that she had been charged sales tax on clothing items erroneously because her resident <a href="http://www.classactionsreporter.com/sites/default/files/unauthorized_sales_tax_cmplaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state of Pennsylvania does not apply sales tax to clothing items</a>. Damages include charges of up to 10.25 percent of a clothing sale for each purchase delivered to a jurisdiction that does not charge a sales tax in general or on clothing items, specifically.

Since others are likely affected by the billing practices and the total amount of claimed damages will likely exceed $5,000, Webster has invoked a class action lawsuit on behalf of all others similarly situated.

Central to the plaintiff’s argument is the fact that LuLaRoe’s proprietary billing system, Audrey, automatically charges sales tax based on the location of the “consultant” conducting the transaction. When LuLaRoe was still in the process of creating Audrey, they stated that taxes would be applied based on the “ship to” address indicated by the customer. Instead, company CEO directly acknowledged that the final version of Audrey charged sales taxes based on the location of the consultant.

LuLaRoe then failed to remit this overcharge to the “taxing authority that governs the transaction.” In the case of the plaintiff, the Pennsylvania State Taxing Authority was not given notice of these supposed tax charges nor were they given the amount obtained from the tax.

The plaintiff maintains that this practice is not only erroneous but outright fraudulent. LuLaRoe would be obtaining “unjust enrichment” under the allegations put forth by the plaintiff. Had the sales tax erroneously collected been paid to the state taxing authorities, the plaintiff would have had to seek a refund from the State. However, because the plaintiff alleges that such money was never paid over to the state, can bring the suit against LuLaRoe. Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount they were overcharged in addition to “reasonable attorneys’ fees and/or other additional relief as this Court deems necessary and proper.”
<h2><strong>Being Cautious About Tax Law in Light of the LuLaRoe Sales Tax Lawsuit</strong></h2>
Until the case proceeds, we have no indication what evidence LuLaRoe might present in defense of their billing practices or in an effort to weaken the plaintiff’s argument. What we do know is this: companies should be very careful with <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales tax practices</a> when selling to people in different tax jurisdictions online.

As you're no doubt aware, Tax Day 2017 was April 18, 2017. How was your filing? Did you decide to push the task off to the last minute due to the fact that you're lacking experience? If so, you're not alone. Filing your taxes on your own may be intimidating, but it's not impossible. Getting familiar with the basics can prepare you for filing in the future, plus it can even get you a better tax return.<a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filing your taxes</a> on your own may be intimidating, but it's not impossible. Getting familiar with the basics can prepare you for filing in the future, plus it can even get you a better tax return.

Here are a few tips for filing taxes on your own for the first time:

<b>1. Educate yourself</b>

If you have no idea what you're doing, use the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> online resources</a> provided by the Internal Revenue Service. You'll learn what you need to get started, how to check the status of your refund and how you can prepare for next year. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/interactive-tax-assistant-ita-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Tax Assistant</a>, for example, is a helpful tool that lets you ask questions in regard to <a href="http://www.scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trust-and-estate-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax law</a>.

<b>2. Use last year's return for reference</b>

Before you sit down and start filing, make sure you have your federal and state returns from the previous year. Go Banking Rates suggested referencing <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/31-tips-doing-own-taxes/5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> last year's returns</a> since most of the information you'll input is the same. Otherwise, be sure to make note of major life events, such as getting married, having a child or starting a new job.

<b>3. Use software</b>

To keep your stress levels down, use software to file your taxes. The IRS suggested ditching the old-school method for e-filing because it's the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/top-five-reasons-to-efile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> safer and simpler option </a>. The software does the math for you, which ensures you'll enter accurate data.

<b>4. Don't forget about deductions and credits</b>

Many people often overlook the deductions that could <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/filing-taxes-for-first-time.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> get them a better tax return</a>, according to Bankrate. For instance, did you know that the IRS allows deductions for printing your resume and traveling to search for a new job? You can also claim charitable contributions and child care. Keep this in mind while you're filing your taxes - hopefully, you've kept all of your pay stubs and receipts throughout the year!

<b>5. Take your time</b>

You may have waited until the very last minute to file your taxes, but that doesn't mean you should rush through them. If you don't take your time while filling out your information, you could make a mistake that delays your refund.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you still don't feel confident regarding tax filing on your own for next year, or you have questions and concerns related to filing your taxes, reach out to the <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> tax, trusts and estates</a> attorneys at Scarcini Hollenbeck.

It may be hard to believe, but Tax Day 2017 has already come and gone. And while you might just be getting over the stress of the past tax season, it's important to be proactive and prepare for 2017. Procrastinating is popular - Bloomberg reported that the IRS collected nearly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-17/millions-of-americans-still-haven-t-filed-their-taxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">29 million returns between April 8 and 22</a> last year, and only 4 million fewer people waited to file until April 7 this year.

But instead of pushing the task off until the last minute and becoming an overwhelming statistic, get yourself in good shape to file in advance in 2017.

Here are a few ways to prepare yourself for the next tax season:

<strong>Save tax documents throughout the year</strong>

Instead of stressing out at the end of the tax year, scrambling through piles of paperwork to collect the information you need to file, start compiling all relevant tax documents through the year.

"Turning tax prep into a routine that you replicate yearly and implement year-long will eliminate the anxiety of having to re-learn something you only think of once a year," Dearing told Forbes.

Whether you love the old school method of saving receipts in a box until tax time, using a scanner and an excel spreadsheet, or want to try a <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/8-ways-you-can-prepare-now-for-next-years-taxes?slide=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new smartphone app</a>, U.S. News &amp; World Report suggested squaring your recordkeeping method in place as soon as possible.

<strong>Pay attention to tax code changes</strong>

With the new White House administration, talks of tax reform and condensed tax brackets are circulating. Stay on your toes and pay attention to potential changes, but also - don't sweat it too much. Carla Dearing, CEO of the online financial wellness firm Sum180, told Forbes that changes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2017/04/11/best-ways-to-get-a-jump-on-your-2017-income-taxes/#7f59b5d53bf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won't necessarily affect you significantly</a>.

"Tax reform is discussed every year," she said. "When it does happen, it's rarely so transformative that your tax prep changes significantly from the year before."

Chances are, tax code changes won't affect your recordkeeping or preparation at all.

Our advice: Keep tabs on what's going on, and reach out to a tax professional if you need help navigating the changes. But just focus on keeping a filing system in place to organize receipts and tax documents throughout the year so you are ready when it's time to file.

<strong>Adjust your withholding</strong>

This year, Bankrate recommended checking your year-to-date withholding and <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reconsidering your current set-up</a> - you may want to think about changing the taxes withheld if you want a larger refund or rather, more immediate take-home money.

"It's a personal choice if you want to have extra money withheld to get a bigger tax refund, but you have options available if you prefer to have a smaller refund next year and more take-home money now," IRS commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement.

But if you ended up owing the IRS at tax time this year, you'll definitely want to review your withholdings to ensure you're withholding at the proper rate and that you claim the right number of exemptions. No one wants to write a check to the IRS.

To adjust the amount of taxes withheld, you'll have to fill out a new W-4 form and submit it to your employer. <strong>Remember</strong>: Now's the perfect time to adjust your withholdings for 2017. If you wait too long and more than six months of the year have already passed - the changes likely won't achieve your desired effect for the total amount of taxes withheld for the year.

In PLR 201725022, a corporation <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received rental income from its leasing of offices</a> for medical and related services.  The taxpayer intended the rental income from its maintenance-related operations as non-passive investment income under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">section 1362(d)(3)(c)(i).</span>

&nbsp;

X was incorporated as a C corporation. X had accumulated earnings and profits. X intended to elect to be an S corporation. X was in the business of acquiring, developing, leasing and managing commercial real estate, concentrating in medical office suites and clinics.

&nbsp;

X owned a parcel of land situated on two contiguous lots. X acquired this parcel of land and at the time of acquisition, it was partially developed as a plaza containing various buildings and commercial office space. X later constructed another building and a separate two-story building. All the property was converted into medical suites.

&nbsp;

All of the suite space comprising was leased for use as medical offices and/or related services.

&nbsp;

X contracted with an independent leasing agent to assist in soliciting prospective tenants, negotiating leases and renewals, and overseeing post-leasing activities such as build-outs and renovations of suite space. X, with the assistance of the independent leasing agent, drafted and negotiated letters of intent to lease available suite spaces. Once letters of intent were accepted, X, with the assistance of the independent leasing agent, prepared lease agreements and renewals with prospective tenants.

&nbsp;

X, through its employees, its agents, and the agents' employees, provided services in maintaining and repairing of the buildings, common areas, and grounds. X utilized a standard lease agreement for its tenants, and under the lease agreement X had the obligation to provide certain services with respect to the leasing of space and to maintain or repair the heat and air conditioning systems, plumbing, hot water heaters, exterior lighting, signs, lawn care and gardening, roofs and exterior walls, exterior walkways, courtyards, parking areas, electricity, water and sewer, drainage, and garbage pickup.

&nbsp;

In addition, X provided services to its tenants by daily walk-through inspections to report on water breaks, lighting outage, vandalism, damage to building exteriors and certain interior spaces; sweeping, cleaning and maintaining the common areas such as sideways, walkways, and parking lot; routine periodic inspection of building exteriors and interiors, including foundations, roofs, exterior lighting, grounds, and parking lot and engaging in maintenance and repairs as needed; treating the roofs of the buildings for moss growth yearly; recoating and resurfacing the parking lot; routine and periodic maintenance of the numerous heating and air conditioning units; renovating vacant suites for leasing; routine and periodic maintenance of the plumbing and sewer lines, and their repair and replacement as needed; maintenance, repair and replacement of exterior lighting and selected interior lighting; janitorial services for selected units and common areas; exterior window washing; regular maintenance of grounds and lawn care, and landscaping services when necessary; seasonal snow removal and ice control; weekly trash removal; periodic pest and vermin control; and emergency response and property access for public safety.

<strong>Issue Before the IRS</strong>

The IRS had to decide if the rental income was active or passive. Additionally, <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/corporate-transactions-and-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if the income was passive could the corporation elect S status</a>.

As S election is terminated whenever the corporation (1) has accumulated earnings and profits at the close of each of three consecutive taxable years, and (2) has gross receipts for each of such taxable years more than 25 percent of which are passive investment income.

Section 1362 provides that the term “passive investment income” means gross receipts derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and sales or exchanges of stock or securities.

Section 1.1362-2(c)(5)(iii)B)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that “rents” means amounts received for the use of, or the right to use, property (whether real or personal) of the corporation.

Section 1.1362-2(c)(5)(ii)(B)(2) provides that “rents” does not include rents derived in the active trade or business of renting property. Rents received by a corporation are derived in the active trade or business of renting property only if, based on all of the facts and circumstances, the corporation provides significant services or incurs substantial costs in the rental business. Generally, significant services are not rendered and substantial costs are not incurred in connection with net leases. Whether significant services are performed or substantial costs are incurred in the rental business is determined based upon all of the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the number of persons employed to provide the services and the types and amounts of costs and expenses incurred (other than depreciation).

<strong>The Bottom Line</strong>

The IRS concluded that the rental income X receives from its operations described above was not passive investment income under <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="ADVPLR:130359.10"></a>section 1362(d)(3)(C)(i).

Similarly Temp. Reg. § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(C) provides that if a taxpayer provides “extraordinary personal services … in connection with making such property available for use by customers,” then the activity is not treated as rental property.  The term “extraordinary personal services” includes those services that “are provided in connection with making property available for use by customers … [where] the use by customers of the property is incidental to their receipt of such services, Temp. Reg. § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v).  Unfortunately, this Regulation does not contain an example that is directly on point.  However, in a Tax Court case, <em>Arsaf F. Al Assaf,</em> 89 TCM 694, T.C. Memo. 2005-14, the court agreed with the taxpayer that the personal services provided were extraordinary.  As result the activity was not considered rental.  In that fact pattern, a limited liability company (LLC) owned an office building and provided substantial support services to its tenants who leased the space to obtain the services.  Thus, the court concluded that the lessees’ payments to the LLC were principally for the services, not for the leased space. After avoiding classification as a rental activity, the activity was found to be not passive because the taxpayer’s participation exceeded 500 hours per year.

Tax planning has become synonymous with nefarious activity but the reality is that <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax planning is essential to the viability of any business</a>.

Consider Mylan, a worldwide pharmaceutical company whose publicly traded holding company moved to the Netherlands in 2015. In that transaction, the shares of the U.S. parent corporation were exchanged for the shares of Mylan N.V., a Dutch company in a taxable inversion. As part of a larger simultaneous transaction, Mylan N.V. acquired certain assets of Abbot Labs thereby removing Abbot’s non-U.S operations from Controlled Foreign Corporation status. If one believes the rest of the world is a growing market, the extraction of these Abbot assets from potential future U.S. taxation will enable Mylan to better compete globally.

As you may know, the United States taxes on a worldwide basis and not a territorial one. Earnings from an active trade or business of a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. corporate parent are not taxed until repatriated. Typically, the problem with repatriation is that there is additional U.S. tax to be paid, especially where those foreign earnings were taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate. This explains why trillions of dollars held by U.S. companies remain offshore. If the foreign business is not active and produces Subpart F income, the income is taxed by the U.S. even if not repatriated. When a business is competing globally, these tax rules inhibit structures that are efficient from a business perspective and present obstacles rather than opportunities. Businessmen look at the competition, which may be based in jurisdictions that offer more favorable tax rules, and decide that their companies must have the same advantages or must shed the disadvantages of a worldwide tax system.

Mylan, as do many other businesses, is under tremendous pressure regarding pricing. Mylan has generic products which suffer, no doubt, from this pressure and a formidable regulatory environment. Transfer pricing is a science or an art form that employs many economists to arrive at a fair price charged between related parties for tax purposes. The inversion offers an opportunity to avoid CFCs, Subpart F, Transfer Pricing (economists) and the Foreign Tax Credit. The fact that companies invert should be no surprise.

Despite all of this, the United States remains a desirable market especially for pharmaceutical products where consumer demand is strong and there is wealth available to make drug purchases. So what does a Mylan do to improve its U.S. results? Waiting for tax reform and lower corporate rates is not a strategy. Mylan reverted to some <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic tax planning by utilizing tax credit incentives</a> to improve its profitability. There is no requirement that these tax credits be generated by one’s core business. Often, it is only by providing tax credit incentives that capital can be attracted to certain types of investments. Clearly, coal is not viewed as a business having a great future.

Mylan invested in five companies eligible to qualify for the Refined Coal Tax Credit. Financial Statements report that $100 million of credits were used in both 2015 and 2016 along with $95 million in 2014. The effective tax rate for Mylan was 4% and 7.4% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense and operating losses further helped Mylan to reduce its effective tax rate. Financial analysts reported that the cost of Mylan’s coal tax-adjusted investment was only sixty percent of the tax credits. Although the coal tax credit expires in 2021, Mylan must be given respect for its efforts to reduce its effective tax rate. Also, Mylan no longer has the pesky problem of repatriation of foreign earnings and has adjusted its structure to adapt to the worldwide business climate.

With the memories of Superstorm Sandy still fresh, we all remember how overwhelming the cleanup and rebuilding process can be.</p>

Thankfully, the Internal Revenue Service (<a href="http://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS</a>) is making it easier to help. One <a href="https://scarincihollenbeck.com/practices/tax-trusts-and-estates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal tax relief program</a> allows employees to donate the value of their vacation, sick time, or other paid time off (PTO) for hurricane relief. The employer may deduct the payment as an ordinary business expense. Another allows hurricane victims and their families to more easily tap into their 401(k) savings without penalty.

<strong>Leave-Based Donation Programs</strong>

The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-special-relief-to-encourage-leave-based-donation-programs-for-victims-of-hurricane-harvey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS Hurricane Henry program</a> allows employees to forgo their vacation, sick or personal leave in exchange for cash payments the employer makes, before Jan. 1, 2019, to charitable organizations providing relief for the victims of this disaster. Under this special relief, the donated leave will not be included in the income or wages of the employees. Employers will be permitted to deduct the cash payments as business expenses not subject to any percentage limitation on charitable deductions. Similar programs were launched in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. After making landfall in Florida, a similar program for Hurricane Irma should follow shortly.

<strong>Retirement Plan Distributions</strong>

The IRS has also initiated <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/retirement-plans-can-make-loans-hardship-distributions-to-victims-of-hurricane-harvey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another hurricane relief program that authorizes 401(k)s</a> and similar employer-sponsored retirement plans to provide loans and hardship distributions to victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, as well as members of their families.

Employees can typically only access funds in their employer retirement plans upon the occurrence of certain events, such as termination of employment, disability or hardship. Under the relief program, a retirement plan can allow a victim of Hurricane Harvey to take a hardship distribution or borrow up to the specified statutory limits from the victim’s retirement plan. In addition, the IRS program allows a person who lives outside the disaster area can take out a retirement plan loan or hardship distribution and use it to assist a son, daughter, parent, grandparent or other dependents who lived or worked in the disaster area.

The IRS has also relaxed the procedures for obtaining a loan or hardship withdrawal. Notably, the six-month ban on 401(k) and 403(b) contributions that normally affects employees who take hardship distributions will not apply, and plans will be allowed to make loans or hardship distributions before the plan is formally amended to provide for such features.

<strong>Hurricane Relief Charity Scams</strong>

Sadly, the IRS has also <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/beware-of-fake-charity-scams-relating-to-hurricane-harvey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a warning regarding hurricane relief scams</a>. “Criminals often send emails that steer recipients to bogus websites that appear to be affiliated with legitimate charitable causes,” the IRS warned. “These sites frequently mimic the sites of, or use names similar to, legitimate charities, or claim to be affiliated with legitimate charities in order to persuade people to send money or provide personal financial information that can be used to steal identities or financial resources.”

To avoid falling victim to a charity scam, verify that you are giving to a recognized organization and never provide personal financial information — such as Social Security numbers or credit card and bank account numbers and passwords — to anyone who solicits a contribution.
